VOur mission is to build
p4
aVa detailed, realistic
p5
aVcomputer model of the human brain.
p6
aVAnd we've done, in the past four years,
p7
aVa proof of concept
p8
aVon a small part of the rodent brain,
p9
aVand with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up
p10
aVto reach the human brain.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhy are we doing this?
p13
aVThere are three important reasons.
p14
aVThe first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain
p15
aVif we do want to get along in society,
p16
aVand I think that it is a key step in evolution.
p17
aVThe second reason is,
p18
aVwe cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,
p19
aVand we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge
p20
aVinto a working model.
p21
aVIt's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.
p22
aVAnd the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet
p23
aVthat are affected by mental disorder,
p24
aVand the drugs that are used today
p25
aVare largely empirical.
p26
aVI think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on
p27
aVhow to treat disorders.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, even at this stage,
p30
aVwe can use the brain model
p31
aVto explore some fundamental questions
p32
aVabout how the brain works.
p33
aVAnd here, at TED, for the first time,
p34
aVI'd like to share with you how we're addressing
p35
aVone theory \u2014 there are many theories \u2014
p36
aVone theory of how the brain works.
p37
aVSo, this theory is that the brain
p38
aVcreates, builds, a version of the universe,
p39
aVand projects this version of the universe,
p40
aVlike a bubble, all around us.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.
p43
aVBut, for the first time, we can actually address this,
p44
aVwith brain simulation,
p45
aVand ask very systematic and rigorous questions,
p46
aVwhether this theory could possibly be true.
p47
aVThe reason why the moon is huge on the horizon
p48
aVis simply because our perceptual bubble
p49
aVdoes not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.
p50
aVIt runs out of space.
p51
aVAnd so what we do is we compare the buildings
p52
aVwithin our perceptual bubble,
p53
aVand we make a decision.
p54
aVWe make a decision it's that big,
p55
aVeven though it's not that big.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd what that illustrates
p58
aVis that decisions are the key things
p59
aVthat support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.
p60
aVWithout decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,
p61
aVyou cannot feel.
p62
aVAnd you may think that anesthetics work
p63
aVby sending you into some deep sleep,
p64
aVor by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,
p65
aVbut in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.
p66
aVWhat they do is they introduce a noise
p67
aVinto the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.
p68
aVThey are confused,
p69
aVand you cannot make a decision.
p70
aVSo, while you're trying to make up your mind
p71
aVwhat the doctor, the surgeon, is doing
p72
aVwhile he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.
p73
aVHe's at home having tea.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, when you walk up to a door and you open it,
p77
aVwhat you compulsively have to do to perceive
p78
aVis to make decisions,
p79
aVthousands of decisions about the size of the room,
p80
aVthe walls, the height, the objects in this room.
p81
aV99 percent of what you see
p82
aVis not what comes in through the eyes.
p83
aVIt is what you infer about that room.
p84
aVSo I can say, with some certainty,
p85
aV"I think, therefore I am."
p86
aVBut I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"
p87
aVbecause "you" are within my perceptual bubble.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, we can speculate and philosophize this,
p90
aVbut we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.
p91
aVWe can ask a very concrete question.
p92
aV"Can the brain build such a perception?"
p93
aVIs it capable of doing it?
p94
aVDoes it have the substance to do it?
p95
aVAnd that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.
p98
aVIt had to improve it a little bit.
p99
aVIt had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,
p100
aVbecause they had to cope on land.
p101
aVBut the real big step was the neocortex.
p102
aVIt's a new brain. You needed it.
p103
aVThe mammals needed it
p104
aVbecause they had to cope with parenthood,
p105
aVsocial interactions,
p106
aVcomplex cognitive functions.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, you can think of the neocortex
p109
aVactually as the ultimate solution today,
p110
aVof the universe as we know it.
p111
aVIt's the pinnacle, it's the final product
p112
aVthat the universe has produced.
p113
aVIt was so successful in evolution
p114
aVthat from mouse to man it expanded
p115
aVabout a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,
p116
aVto produce this almost frightening
p117
aVorgan, structure.
p118
aVAnd it has not stopped its evolutionary path.
p119
aVIn fact, the neocortex in the human brain
p120
aVis evolving at an enormous speed.
p121
aa(lp122
VIf you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,
p123
aVyou discover that it's made up of little modules,
p124
aVG5 processors, like in a computer.
p125
aVBut there are about a million of them.
p126
aVThey were so successful in evolution
p127
aVthat what we did was to duplicate them
p128
aVover and over and add more and more of them to the brain
p129
aVuntil we ran out of space in the skull.
p130
aVAnd the brain started to fold in on itself,
p131
aVand that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.
p132
aVWe're just packing in columns,
p133
aVso that we'd have more neocortical columns
p134
aVto perform more complex functions.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo you can think of the neocortex actually as
p137
aVa massive grand piano,
p138
aVa million-key grand piano.
p139
aVEach of these neocortical columns
p140
aVwould produce a note.
p141
aVYou stimulate it; it produces a symphony.
p142
aVBut it's not just a symphony of perception.
p143
aVIt's a symphony of your universe, your reality.
p144
aVNow, of course it takes years to learn how
p145
aVto master a grand piano with a million keys.
p146
aVThat's why you have to send your kids to good schools,
p147
aVhopefully eventually to Oxford.
p148
aVBut it's not only education.
p149
aVIt's also genetics.
p150
aVYou may be born lucky,
p151
aVwhere you know how to master your neocortical column,
p152
aVand you can play a fantastic symphony.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn fact, there is a new theory of autism
p155
aVcalled the "intense world" theory,
p156
aVwhich suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.
p157
aVThey are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,
p158
aVand so the autists are probably capable of
p159
aVbuilding and learning a symphony
p160
aVwhich is unthinkable for us.
p161
aVBut you can also understand
p162
aVthat if you have a disease
p163
aVwithin one of these columns,
p164
aVthe note is going to be off.
p165
aVThe perception, the symphony that you create
p166
aVis going to be corrupted,
p167
aVand you will have symptoms of disease.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo, the Holy Grail for neuroscience
p170
aVis really to understand the design of the neocoritical column \u2014
p171
aVand it's not just for neuroscience;
p172
aVit's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,
p173
aVand perhaps to even also understand physical reality.
p174
aVSo, what we did was, for the past 15 years,
p175
aVwas to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.
p176
aVIt's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.
p177
aVHow many trees does it have?
p178
aVWhat shapes are the trees?
p179
aVHow many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?
p180
aa(lp181
VBut it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to
p182
aVdescribe and discover all the rules of communication,
p183
aVthe rules of connectivity,
p184
aVbecause the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.
p185
aVThey choose very carefully who they connect with.
p186
aVIt's also more than cataloging
p187
aVbecause you actually have to build three-dimensional
p188
aVdigital models of them.
p189
aVAnd we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,
p190
aVbuilt digital models of all the different types
p191
aVof neurons we came across.
p192
aVAnd once you have that, you can actually
p193
aVbegin to build the neocortical column.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd here we're coiling them up.
p196
aVBut as you do this, what you see
p197
aVis that the branches intersect
p198
aVactually in millions of locations,
p199
aVand at each of these intersections
p200
aVthey can form a synapse.
p201
aVAnd a synapse is a chemical location
p202
aVwhere they communicate with each other.
p203
aVAnd these synapses together
p204
aVform the network
p205
aVor the circuit of the brain.
p206
aVNow, the circuit, you could also think of as
p207
aVthe fabric of the brain.
p208
aVAnd when you think of the fabric of the brain,
p209
aVthe structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?
p210
aVYou realize that this poses
p211
aVa fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,
p212
aVand especially to a theory that says
p213
aVthat there is some reality that emerges
p214
aVout of this carpet, out of this particular carpet
p215
aVwith a particular pattern.
p216
aa(lp217
VThe reason is because the most important design secret of the brain
p218
aVis diversity.
p219
aVEvery neuron is different.
p220
aVIt's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.
p221
aVYou may have many different types of trees,
p222
aVbut every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.
p223
aVSo there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,
p224
aVand there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.
p225
aVAnd your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned
p226
aVin exactly the same way.
p227
aVAnd you may have more or less neurons.
p228
aVSo it's very unlikely
p229
aVthat you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo, how could we possibly create a reality
p232
aVthat we can even understand each other?
p233
aVWell, we don't have to speculate.
p234
aVWe can look at all 10 million synapses now.
p235
aVWe can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.
p236
aVWe can use different neurons with different variations.
p237
aVWe can position them in different places,
p238
aVorient them in different places.
p239
aVWe can use less or more of them.
p240
aVAnd when we do that
p241
aVwhat we discovered is that the circuitry does change.
p242
aVBut the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.
p243
aVSo, the fabric of the brain,
p244
aVeven though your brain may be smaller, bigger,
p245
aVit may have different types of neurons,
p246
aVdifferent morphologies of neurons,
p247
aVwe actually do share
p248
aVthe same fabric.
p249
aVAnd we think this is species-specific,
p250
aVwhich means that that could explain
p251
aVwhy we can't communicate across species.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do
p254
aVis you have to make this come alive.
p255
aVWe make it come alive
p256
aVwith equations, a lot of mathematics.
p257
aVAnd, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators
p258
aVwere discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.
p259
aVSo, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.
p260
aVWe also have the mathematics to describe
p261
aVhow neurons collect information,
p262
aVand how they create a little lightning bolt
p263
aVto communicate with each other.
p264
aVAnd when they get to the synapse,
p265
aVwhat they do is they effectively,
p266
aVliterally, shock the synapse.
p267
aVIt's like electrical shock
p268
aVthat releases the chemicals from these synapses.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd we've got the mathematics to describe this process.
p271
aVSo we can describe the communication between the neurons.
p272
aVThere literally are only a handful
p273
aVof equations that you need to simulate
p274
aVthe activity of the neocortex.
p275
aVBut what you do need is a very big computer.
p276
aVAnd in fact you need one laptop
p277
aVto do all the calculations just for one neuron.
p278
aVSo you need 10,000 laptops.
p279
aVSo where do you go? You go to IBM,
p280
aVand you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take
p281
aV10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.
p282
aVSo now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.
p283
aVWe can load up all the neurons,
p284
aVeach one on to its processor,
p285
aVand fire it up, and see what happens.
p286
aVTake the magic carpet for a ride.
p287
aa(lp288
VHere we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse
p289
aVof what is happening in your brain
p290
aVwhen there is a stimulation.
p291
aVIt's the first view.
p292
aVNow, when you look at that the first time, you think,
p293
aV"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"
p294
aVBut, in fact, you can start,
p295
aVeven though we haven't trained this neocortical column
p296
aVto create a specific reality.
p297
aVBut we can ask, "Where is the rose?"
p298
aVWe can ask, "Where is it inside,
p299
aVif we stimulate it with a picture?"
p300
aVWhere is it inside the neocortex?
p301
aVUltimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo, the way that we can look at that
p304
aVis to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,
p305
aVand look just at the raw electrical activity.
p306
aVBecause that is what it's creating.
p307
aVIt's creating electrical patterns.
p308
aVSo when we did this,
p309
aVwe indeed, for the first time,
p310
aVsaw these ghost-like structures:
p311
aVelectrical objects appearing
p312
aVwithin the neocortical column.
p313
aVAnd it's these electrical objects
p314
aVthat are holding all the information about
p315
aVwhatever stimulated it.
p316
aVAnd then when we zoomed into this,
p317
aVit's like a veritable universe.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo the next step
p320
aVis just to take these brain coordinates
p321
aVand to project them into perceptual space.
p322
aVAnd if you do that,
p323
aVyou will be able to step inside
p324
aVthe reality that is created
p325
aVby this machine,
p326
aVby this piece of the brain.
p327
aVSo, in summary,
p328
aVI think that the universe may have \u2014
p329
aVit's possible \u2014
p330
aVevolved a brain to see itself,
p331
aVwhich may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.
p332
aVThere is a lot more to do to test these theories,
p333
aVand to test any other theories.
p334
aVBut I hope that you are at least partly convinced
p335
aVthat it is not impossible to build a brain.
p336
aVWe can do it within 10 years,
p337
aVand if we do succeed,
p338
aVwe will send to TED, in 10 years,
p339
aVa hologram to talk to you. Thank you.
