VYou probably all agree with me
p10
aVthat this is a very nice road.
p11
aVIt's made of asphalt,
p12
aVand asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,
p13
aVbut not always, especially not on these days as today,
p14
aVwhen it's raining a lot.
p15
aVThen you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.
p16
aVAnd especially if you then ride with your bicycle,
p17
aVand pass these cars, then that's not very nice.
p18
aVAlso, asphalt can create a lot of noise.
p19
aVIt's a noisy material,
p20
aVand if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,
p21
aVvery close to cities, then we would like a silent road.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe solution for that is to make roads
p24
aVout of porous asphalt.
p25
aVPorous asphalt, a material that we use now
p26
aVin most of the highways in the Netherlands,
p27
aVit has pores and water can just rain through it,
p28
aVso all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,
p29
aVand you have a road that's easy to drive on,
p30
aVso no splash water anymore.
p31
aVAlso the noise will disappear in these pores.
p32
aVBecause it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,
p33
aVso it's a very silent road.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt also has disadvantages, of course,
p36
aVand the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.
p37
aVWhat is raveling? You see that in this road
p38
aVthat the stones at the surface come off.
p39
aVFirst you get one stone, then several more,
p40
aVand more and more and more and more,
p41
aVand then they \u2014 well, I will not do that. (Laughter)
p42
aVBut they can damage your windshield,
p43
aVso you're not happy with that.
p44
aVAnd finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.
p45
aVSometimes you can create potholes with that.
p46
aVHa. He's ready.
p47
aa(lp48
VPotholes, of course, that can become a problem,
p49
aVbut we have a solution.
p50
aVHere you see actually how the damage appears in this material.
p51
aVIt's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only
p52
aVa small amount of binder between the stones.
p53
aVDue to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,
p54
aVthis binder, this bitumen,
p55
aVthe glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,
p56
aVand if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,
p57
aVand it delaminates from the aggregates.
p58
aVThen if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates \u2014
p59
aVwhat we just saw here.
p60
aVTo solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.
p61
aVIf we can make this material self-healing,
p62
aVthen probably we have a solution.
p63
aVSo what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,
p64
aVand the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,
p65
aVand these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.
p66
aVSo then you have asphalt
p67
aVwith very small pieces of steel wool in it.
p68
aVThen you need a machine, like you see here,
p69
aVthat you can use for cooking \u2014 an induction machine.
p70
aVInduction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.
p71
aVThen what you do is you heat up the steel,
p72
aVyou melt the bitumen,
p73
aVand the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,
p74
aVand the stones are again fixed to the surface.
p75
aa(lp76
VToday I use a microwave because I cannot take
p77
aVthe big induction machine here onstage.
p78
aVSo a microwave is a similar system.
p79
aVSo I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out
p80
aVto see what happened.
p81
aVSo this is the specimen coming out now.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab
p84
aVto heat up the specimens.
p85
aVWe tested a lot of specimens there,
p86
aVand then the government, they actually saw our results,
p87
aVand they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."
p88
aVSo they donated to us a piece of highway,
p89
aV400 meters of the A58, where we had to make
p90
aVa test track to test this material.
p91
aVSo that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,
p92
aVand then of course this road will last several years
p93
aVwithout any damage. That's what we know from practice.
p94
aVSo we took a lot of samples from this road
p95
aVand we tested them in the lab.
p96
aVSo we did aging on the samples,
p97
aVdid a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,
p98
aVand healed them and tested them again.
p99
aVSeveral times we can repeat that.
p100
aVSo actually, the conclusion from this research is that
p101
aVif we go on the road every four years
p102
aVwith our healing machine \u2014 this is the big version
p103
aVwe have made to go on the real road \u2014
p104
aVif we go on the road every four years
p105
aVwe can double the surface life of this road,
p106
aVwhich of course saves a lot of money.
p107
aa(lp108
VWell, to conclude, I can say
p109
aVthat we made a material
p110
aVusing steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,
p111
aVusing induction energy to really
p112
aVincrease the surface life of the road,
p113
aVdouble the surface life you can even do,
p114
aVso it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd now you're of course curious if it also worked.
p117
aVSo we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.
p118
aVActually, it still has to cool down first
p119
aVbefore I can show you that the healing works.
p120
aVBut I will do a trial.
p121
aVLet's see. Yeah, it worked.
p122
aVThank you.
