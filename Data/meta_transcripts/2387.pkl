VGreat things happen at intersections.
p4
aVIn fact, I would argue that some of the most interesting things
p5
aVof the human experience occur at the intersections,
p6
aVin the liminal space,
p7
aVwhere by liminal I mean the space in-between.
p8
aVThere's freedom in that in-between,
p9
aVfreedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,
p10
aVa new self-definition.
p11
aVSome of the great intersections of the world come to mind,
p12
aVlike the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,
p13
aVor Times Square in New York City,
p14
aVboth bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people.
p15
aVOther intersections,
p16
aVlike the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama,
p17
aVor Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind
p18
aVbecause of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings,
p19
aVideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice.
p20
aa(lp21
VBeyond the physical landscape of our planet,
p22
aVsome of the most famous celestial images are of intersections.
p23
aVStars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust,
p24
aVinstigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.
p25
aVStars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward
p26
aVin a violent collision of smaller atoms,
p27
aVintersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things.
p28
aVWe can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us.
p29
aVTo be intersectional, then,
p30
aVis to occupy a position at an intersection.
p31
aa(lp32
VI've lived the entirety of my life in the in-between,
p33
aVin the liminal space between dreams and reality,
p34
aVrace and gender,
p35
aVpoverty and plenty,
p36
aVscience and society.
p37
aVI am both black and a woman.
p38
aVLike the birth of stars in the heavenlies,
p39
aVthis robust combination of knowing results in a shining example
p40
aVof the explosive fusion of identities.
p41
aa(lp42
VI am also an astrophysicist.
p43
aVI study blazars, supermassive, hyperactive black holes
p44
aVthat sit at the centers of massive galaxies
p45
aVand shoot out jets nearby those black holes
p46
aVat speeds approaching the speed of light
p47
aVin a process we are still trying to completely understand.
p48
aa(lp49
VI have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist
p50
aVsince I was 12 years old.
p51
aVI had no idea that at that time,
p52
aVaccording to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics,
p53
aVonly 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD
p54
aVin a physics-related discipline,
p55
aVand that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field
p56
aVdid so just one year before my birth.
p57
aa(lp58
VAs I journeyed along my path,
p59
aVI encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection:
p60
aVthe tremendous opportunity to self-define,
p61
aVthe collision of expectation and experience,
p62
aVthe exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs
p63
aVand, sometimes,
p64
aVthe explosive pain of regeneration.
p65
aa(lp66
VI began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart.
p67
aVOur financial situation disintegrated
p68
aVjust after my father's departure from our lives.
p69
aVThis thrust my mother, my sister and I
p70
aVout of the relative comfort of middle-class life
p71
aVand into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet.
p72
aVThus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color
p73
aVwho find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals.
p74
aVThankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding,
p75
aVand I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics.
p76
aa(lp77
VAfter graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,
p78
aVI fell through the cracks.
p79
aVIt was a poster that saved my dream,
p80
aVand some really incredible people and programs.
p81
aVThe American Physical Society had this beautiful poster
p82
aVencouraging students of color to become physicists.
p83
aVIt was striking to me because it featured a young black girl,
p84
aVprobably around 12 years old,
p85
aVlooking studiously at some physics equations.
p86
aVI remember thinking
p87
aVI was looking directly back at the little girl
p88
aVwho first dared to dream this dream.
p89
aVI immediately wrote to the Society
p90
aVand requested my personal copy of the poster,
p91
aVwhich to this day still hangs in my office.
p92
aVI described to them in the email my educational path,
p93
aVand my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD.
p94
aVThey directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program,
p95
aVitself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees
p96
aVat two institutions.
p97
aVAfter two years out of school, they accepted me into the program,
p98
aVand I found myself again on the path to the PhD.
p99
aa(lp100
VAfter receiving my master's at Fisk,
p101
aVI went on to Yale to complete my PhD.
p102
aVOnce I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way
p103
aVto my childhood aspirations,
p104
aVI anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VIt became immediately apparent
p109
aVthat not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality
p110
aVin their space.
p111
aVI was ostracized by many of my classmates,
p112
aVone of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do"
p113
aVas he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up.
p114
aVI wish that were an isolated occurrence,
p115
aVbut for many women of color
p116
aVin science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM,
p117
aVthis is something they have long endured.
p118
aVOne hundred percent of the 60 women of color
p119
aVinterviewed in a recent study by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings
p120
aVreported facing racialized gender bias,
p121
aVincluding being mistaken for the janitorial staff.
p122
aVThis mistaken identity was not reported
p123
aVby any of the white women interviewed for this study,
p124
aVwhich comprised 557 women in total.
p125
aVWhile there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position,
p126
aVand in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college
p127
aVbecause many of their parents worked these jobs,
p128
aVit was a clear attempt to put me in my place.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhile there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter,
p131
aVthe real issue is that my appearance
p132
aVcan tell anyone anything about my ability.
p133
aVBeyond that, though, it underscores
p134
aVthat the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers
p135
aVthat just women or just people of color face.
p136
aVThat's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM,
p137
aVwho are inexorably, unapologetically
p138
aVliving as the inseparable sum of identities.
p139
aa(lp140
VSTEM itself is an intersectional term,
p141
aVsuch that its true richness cannot be appreciated
p142
aVwithout considering the liminal space between disciplines.
p143
aVScience, the pursuit of understanding the physical world
p144
aVby way of chemistry, physics, biology,
p145
aVcannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics.
p146
aVEngineering requires the application of basic science and math
p147
aVto the lived experience.
p148
aVTechnology sits firmly on the foundation of math,
p149
aVengineering and science.
p150
aVMath itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone,
p151
aVdecoding and encoding the physical principles of the world.
p152
aVSTEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece.
p153
aVThis is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized
p154
aVwhen STEM is combined with other disciplines.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe purpose for this talk is twofold:
p157
aVfirst, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation
p158
aVor any other woman or girl
p159
aVwho finds herself resting at the blessed intersection
p160
aVof race and gender,
p161
aVthat you can be anything you want to be.
p162
aVMy personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist,
p163
aVbut beyond that, anything you want.
p164
aVDo not think for one minute
p165
aVthat because you are who you are,
p166
aVyou cannot be who you imagine yourself to be.
p167
aVHold fast to those dreams
p168
aVand let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine.
p169
aa(lp170
VSecondly, among the most pressing issues of our time,
p171
aVmost now find their intersection with STEM.
p172
aVWe have as a global society solved
p173
aVmost of the single-faceted issues of our time.
p174
aVThose that remain require a thorough investigation
p175
aVof the liminal space between disciplines
p176
aVto create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow.
p177
aVWho better to solve these liminal problems
p178
aVthan those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections.
p179
aVWe as thought leaders and decision makers
p180
aVmust push past the first steps of diversity
p181
aVand into the richer and more robust territory
p182
aVof full inclusion and equal opportunity.
p183
aa(lp184
VOne of my favorite examples of liminal excellence
p185
aVcomes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,
p186
aVa black woman plasma physicist,
p187
aVwho passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.
p188
aVShe was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side
p189
aVof the Rosetta mission,
p190
aVwhich became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet,
p191
aVand the 1.5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter,
p192
aVtwo high-profile scientific victories
p193
aVfor NASA, the United States and the world.
p194
aVDr. Alexander said it this way:
p195
aV"I'm used to walking between two cultures.
p196
aVFor me, it's among the purposes of my life
p197
aVto take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding
p198
aVwith bold exploration that you can't do every day."
p199
aa(lp200
VThis shows exactly the power of a liminal person.
p201
aVShe had the technical ability to spearhead
p202
aVsome of the most ambitious space missions of our time,
p203
aVand she perfectly understood her place
p204
aVof being exactly who she was in any place she was.
p205
aa(lp206
VJessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products,
p207
aVlike soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them,
p208
aVsaid it this way:
p209
aV"A major part of invention isn't just creating things,
p210
aVit's understanding people
p211
aVand understanding the systems that make this world."
p212
aVThe reason I tell my story
p213
aVand the story of Dr. Alexander and Jessica Matthews
p214
aVis because they are fundamentally intersectional stories,
p215
aVthe stories of lives lived at the nexus of race, gender and innovation.
p216
aa(lp217
VDespite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space,
p218
aVI'm proud to report that when I graduated,
p219
aVI was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics
p220
aVin Yale's then 312-year history.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VI am now part of a small but growing cadre of women of color in STEM
p225
aVwho are poised to bring new perspectives and new ideas to life
p226
aVon the most pressing issues of our time:
p227
aVthings like educational inequities,
p228
aVpolice brutality, HIV/AIDS, climate change, genetic editing,
p229
aVartificial intelligence and Mars exploration.
p230
aVThis is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet.
p231
aa(lp232
VWomen of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest
p233
aVand most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time.
p234
aVThus, we are uniquely positioned
p235
aVto contribute to and drive these conversations
p236
aVin ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience.
p237
aVThis outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people
p238
aVwhose experiences, positive and negative,
p239
aVenrich the conversations in ways that outmatch
p240
aVeven the best-resourced homogenous groups.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis is not a request born out of a desire to fit in.
p243
aVIt's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes
p244
aVfor the totality of humanity
p245
aVwithout precisely this collaboration,
p246
aVthis bringing together of the liminal,
p247
aVthe differently lived, distinctly experienced
p248
aVand disparately impacted.
p249
aVSimply put, we cannot be the most excellent expression
p250
aVof our collective genius
p251
aVwithout the full measure of humanity brought to bear.
