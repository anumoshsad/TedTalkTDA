VI started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago
p4
aVwhen I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy.
p5
aVBecause I was new to the city, I didn't have access to a stage,
p6
aVso I decided to create my own in public places.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo the first project we're going to take a look at
p9
aVis the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
p10
aVNow, this took place in January of 2002.
p11
aVAnd this woman is the star of the video.
p12
aVShe doesn't know she's being filmed.
p13
aVShe's being filmed with a hidden camera.
p14
aVThis is on the 6 train in New York City.
p15
aVAnd this is the first stop along the line.
p16
aVThese are two Danish guys
p17
aVwho come in and sit down next to the hidden camera.
p18
aVAnd that's me right there in a brown coat.
p19
aVIt's about 30 degrees outside.
p20
aVI'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
p21
aVAnd the girl's going to notice me right here.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VAt this point \u2014
p30
aVat this point she's noticed me,
p31
aVbut in New York there's weirdos on any given train car.
p32
aVOne person's not that unusual.
p33
aVShe goes back to reading her book, which is unfortunately titled "Rape."
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo she's noticed the unusual thing, but she's gone back to her normal life.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, in the meantime, I have six friends
p40
aVwho are waiting at the next six consecutive stops
p41
aVin their underwear as well.
p42
aVThey're going to be entering this car one by one.
p43
aVWe'll act as though we don't know each other.
p44
aVAnd we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made,
p45
aVforgetting our pants on this cold January day.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter continues)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo at this point,
p52
aVshe decides to put the rape book away.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings.
p57
aVIn the meantime, the two Danish guys to the left of the camera,
p58
aVthey're cracking up.
p59
aVThey think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen before.
p60
aVAnd watch her make eye contact with them right about now.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd I love that moment in this video,
p65
aVbecause before it became a shared experience,
p66
aVit was something that was maybe a little bit scary,
p67
aVor something that was at least confusing to her.
p68
aVAnd then, once it became a shared experience,
p69
aVit was funny and something that she could laugh at.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the video won't show everything.
p76
aVThis goes on for another four stops.
p77
aVA total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear.
p78
aVAt the eighth stop, a girl came in with a giant duffel bag
p79
aVand announced she had pants for sale for a dollar \u2014
p80
aVlike you might sell batteries or candy on the train.
p81
aVWe all very matter-of-factly bought a pair of pants, put them on
p82
aVand said, "Thank you. That's exactly what I needed today,"
p83
aVand then exited without revealing what had happened
p84
aVand went in all different directions.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThank you.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo that's a still from the video there.
p91
aVAnd I love that girl's reaction so much.
p92
aVAnd watching that videotape later that day
p93
aVinspired me to keep doing what I do.
p94
aVAnd really one of the points of Improv Everywhere
p95
aVis to cause a scene in a public place
p96
aVthat is a positive experience for other people.
p97
aVIt's a prank, but it's a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell.
p98
aVAnd her reaction inspired me
p99
aVto do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride.
p100
aVAnd we've continued to do it every year.
p101
aVThis January, we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride
p102
aVwhere a diverse group of 3,500 people
p103
aVrode the train in their underwear in New York \u2014
p104
aValmost every single train line in the city.
p105
aVAnd also in 50 other cities around the world,
p106
aVpeople participated.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VAs I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater
p111
aVand meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians,
p112
aVI started amassing a mailing list of people
p113
aVwho wanted to do these types of projects.
p114
aVSo I could do more large-scale projects.
p115
aVWell, one day I was walking through Union Square,
p116
aVand I saw this building, which had just been built in 2005.
p117
aVThere was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing.
p118
aVIt was very peculiar, because it was dark out,
p119
aVbut she was backlit with florescent lighting.
p120
aVShe was very much onstage
p121
aVand I couldn't figure out why she was doing it.
p122
aVAfter about 15 seconds, her friend appeared \u2014
p123
aVshe had been hiding behind a display.
p124
aVThey laughed, hugged each other and ran away.
p125
aVMaybe she had been dared to do this.
p126
aVSo I got inspired by that.
p127
aVLooking at the entire facade \u2014 there were 70 total windows \u2014
p128
aVand I knew what I had to do.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VSo this project is called Look Up More.
p133
aVWe had 70 actors dress in black.
p134
aVThis was completely unauthorized.
p135
aVWe didn't let the stores know we were coming.
p136
aVAnd I stood in the park giving signals.
p137
aVThe first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters
p138
aVthat spelled out "Look Up More,"
p139
aVthe name of the project.
p140
aVThe second signal was for everybody to do jumping jacks together.
p141
aVYou'll see that start right here.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
p146
aVAnd then we had dance solos
p147
aVwhere only one person would dance and everybody would point to them.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo then I gave a new hand signal,
p152
aVwhich signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21,
p153
aVand he danced.
p154
aVThere were several other activities.
p155
aVWe had people jumping up and down, people dropping to the ground.
p156
aVAnd I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt,
p157
aVputting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement.
p158
aVAnd because it was in Union Square Park, right by a subway station,
p159
aVthere were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up
p160
aVand watched what we were doing.
p161
aVThere's a better photo of it.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo that particular event was inspired by a moment
p164
aVthat I happened to stumble upon.
p165
aVThe next project I want to show
p166
aVwas given to me in an email from a stranger.
p167
aVA high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006
p168
aVand said, "You should get as many people as possible
p169
aVto put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants
p170
aVand go into a Best Buy and stand around."
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
V(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VSo I wrote this high school kid back immediately
p177
aVand I said, "Yes, you are correct.
p178
aVI think I'll try to do that this weekend. Thank you."
p179
aVSo here's the video.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo again, this is 2005.
p182
aVThis is the Best Buy in New York City.
p183
aVWe had about 80 people show up to participate,
p184
aVentering one by one.
p185
aVThere was an eight-year-old girl, a 10-year-old girl.
p186
aVThere was also a 65-year-old man who participated.
p187
aVSo a very diverse group of people.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd I told people, "Don't work. Don't actually do work.
p192
aVBut also, don't shop.
p193
aVJust stand around and don't face products."
p194
aVNow you can see the regular employees
p195
aVby the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt.
p196
aVEverybody else is one of our actors.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VThe lower-level employees thought it was very funny.
p201
aVSeveral of them went to go get their camera from the break room
p202
aVand took photos with us.
p203
aVA lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back
p204
aVto get heavy television sets for customers.
p205
aVThe managers and the security guards, on the other hand,
p206
aVdid not find it particularly funny.
p207
aVYou can see them in this footage.
p208
aVThey're wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
p209
aVAnd we were there probably 10 minutes
p210
aVbefore the managers decided to dial 911.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VSo they started running around
p215
aVtelling everybody the cops were coming, "Watch out, the cops are coming."
p216
aVAnd you can see the cops in this footage right here.
p217
aVThat's a cop wearing black right there, being filmed with a hidden camera.
p218
aVUltimately, the police had to inform Best Buy management
p219
aVthat it was not, in fact, illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
V(Applause)
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VSo we had been there for 20 minutes; we were happy to exit the store.
p230
aVOne thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras.
p231
aVAnd they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.
p232
aVBut the one camera guy they never caught
p233
aVwas the guy that went in just with a blank tape
p234
aVand went over to the Best Buy camera department
p235
aVand just put his tape in one of their cameras
p236
aVand pretended to shop.
p237
aVSo I like that concept of using their own technology against them.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VI think our best projects are ones that are site-specific
p242
aVand happen at a particular place for a reason.
p243
aVAnd one morning, I was riding the subway.
p244
aVI had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop
p245
aVwhere there are these two giant escalators.
p246
aVAnd it's a very depressing place to be in the morning, it's very crowded.
p247
aVSo I decided to try and stage something
p248
aVthat could make it as happy as possible for one morning.
p249
aVSo this was in the winter of 2009 \u2014 8:30 in the morning.
p250
aVIt's morning rush hour.
p251
aVIt's very cold outside.
p252
aVPeople are coming in from Queens,
p253
aVtransferring from the E train to the 6 train.
p254
aVAnd they're going up these giant escalators
p255
aVon their way to their jobs.
p256
aa(lp257
V[Rob wants]
p258
aV[to give you]
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
V[a high five!]
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
V[Get ready!]
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.
p273
aVSo there's a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better.
p274
aVHe gave 2,000 high fives that day,
p275
aVand he washed his hands before and afterward
p276
aVand did not get sick.
p277
aVAnd that was done also without permission,
p278
aValthough no one seemed to care.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo I'd say over the years,
p281
aVone of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere
p282
aVleft anonymously on YouTube comments
p283
aVis: "These people have too much time on their hands."
p284
aVAnd you know, not everybody's going to like everything you do,
p285
aVand I've certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments,
p286
aVbut that one's always bothered me,
p287
aVbecause we don't have too much time on our hands.
p288
aVThe participants in Improv Everywhere events
p289
aVhave just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers,
p290
aVthey just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way.
p291
aa(lp292
VYou know, every Saturday and Sunday,
p293
aVhundreds of thousands of people each fall
p294
aVgather in football stadiums to watch games.
p295
aVAnd I've never seen anybody comment, looking at a football game,
p296
aV"All those people in the stands, they have too much time on their hands."
p297
aVAnd of course they don't.
p298
aVIt's a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon,
p299
aVwatching a football game in a stadium.
p300
aVBut I think it's also a perfectly valid way
p301
aVto spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people
p302
aVin the Grand Central terminal
p303
aVor dressing up like a ghostbuster
p304
aVand running through the New York Public Library.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VOr listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people
p309
aVand dancing silently in a park,
p310
aVor bursting into song in a grocery store
p311
aVas part of a spontaneous musical,
p312
aVor diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VYou know, as kids, we're taught to play.
p317
aVAnd we're never given a reason why we should play.
p318
aVIt's just acceptable that play is a good thing.
p319
aVAnd I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
p320
aVIt's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
p321
aVWe don't need a reason. As long as it's fun
p322
aVand it seems like it's going to be a funny idea
p323
aVand it seems like the people who witness it
p324
aVwill also have a fun time,
p325
aVthen that's enough for us.
p326
aVAnd I think, as adults, we need to learn
p327
aVthat there's no right or wrong way to play.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you very much.
