VNow, if President Obama
p4
aVinvited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,
p5
aVthen I would have a suggestion for him
p6
aVthat I think would vastly improve
p7
aVthe mathematics education in this country.
p8
aVAnd it would be easy to implement
p9
aVand inexpensive.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe mathematics curriculum that we have
p12
aVis based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
p13
aVAnd everything we learn after that
p14
aVis building up towards one subject.
p15
aVAnd at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
p16
aVAnd I'm here to say
p17
aVthat I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
p18
aVthat the correct summit \u2014 that all of our students,
p19
aVevery high school graduate should know \u2014
p20
aVshould be statistics:
p21
aVprobability and statistics.
p22
aV(Applause)
p23
aa(lp24
VI mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.
p25
aVIt's one of the great products of the human mind.
p26
aVThe laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
p27
aVAnd every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,
p28
aVthey should definitely learn calculus
p29
aVby the end of their freshman year of college.
p30
aVBut I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,
p31
aVthat very few people actually use calculus
p32
aVin a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
p33
aVOn the other hand,
p34
aVstatistics \u2014 that's a subject that you could,
p35
aVand should, use on daily basis. Right?
p36
aVIt's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.
p37
aVIt's understanding data.
p38
aa(lp39
VI think if our students, if our high school students \u2014
p40
aVif all of the American citizens \u2014
p41
aVknew about probability and statistics,
p42
aVwe wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)
p43
aVNot only \u2014 thank you \u2014 not only that ...
p44
aVbut if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.
p45
aVI mean, probability and statistics,
p46
aVit's the mathematics of games and gambling.
p47
aVIt's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
p48
aVLook, the world has changed
p49
aVfrom analog to digital.
p50
aVAnd it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change
p51
aVfrom analog to digital,
p52
aVfrom the more classical, continuous mathematics,
p53
aVto the more modern, discrete mathematics \u2014
p54
aVthe mathematics of uncertainty,
p55
aVof randomness, of data \u2014
p56
aVthat being probability and statistics.
p57
aa(lp58
VIn summary, instead of our students
p59
aVlearning about the techniques of calculus,
p60
aVI think it would be far more significant
p61
aVif all of them knew what two standard deviations
p62
aVfrom the mean means. And I mean it.
p63
aVThank you very much.
