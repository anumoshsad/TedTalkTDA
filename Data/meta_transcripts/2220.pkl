VI'm a potter,
p4
aVwhich seems like a fairly humble vocation.
p5
aVI know a lot about pots.
p6
aVI've spent about 15 years making them.
p7
aVOne of the things that really excites me in my artistic practice
p8
aVand being trained as a potter
p9
aVis that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing;
p10
aVthat I spent a lot of time at my wheel with mounds of clay trying stuff;
p11
aVand that the limitations of my capacity, my ability,
p12
aVwas based on my hands and my imagination;
p13
aVthat if I wanted to make a really nice bowl
p14
aVand I didn't know how to make a foot yet,
p15
aVI would have to learn how to make a foot;
p16
aVthat that process of learning has been very, very helpful to my life.
p17
aVI feel like, as a potter,
p18
aVyou also start to learn how to shape the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VThere have been times in my artistic capacity
p21
aVthat I wanted to reflect
p22
aVon other really important moments
p23
aVin the history of the U.S., the history of the world
p24
aVwhere tough things happened,
p25
aVbut how do you talk about tough ideas
p26
aVwithout separating people from that content?
p27
aVCould I use art like these old, discontinued firehoses from Alabama,
p28
aVto talk about the complexities of a moment of civil rights in the '60s?
p29
aVIs it possible to talk about my father and I doing labor projects?
p30
aVMy dad was a roofer, construction guy, he owned small businesses,
p31
aVand at 80, he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance.
p32
aVNow, a tar kettle doesn't sound like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.
p33
aVIt was stinky and it took up a lot of space in my studio,
p34
aVbut I asked my dad if he would be willing to make some art with me,
p35
aVif we could reimagine this kind of nothing material
p36
aVas something very special.
p37
aVAnd by elevating the material and my dad's skill,
p38
aVcould we start to think about tar just like clay, in a new way,
p39
aVshaping it differently, helping us to imagine what was possible?
p40
aa(lp41
VAfter clay, I was then kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials,
p42
aVand my studio grew a lot because I thought, well,
p43
aVit's not really about the material, it's about our capacity to shape things.
p44
aVI became more and more interested in ideas
p45
aVand more and more things that  were happening just outside my studio.
p46
aVJust to give you a little bit of context, I live in Chicago.
p47
aVI live on the South Side now. I'm a West Sider.
p48
aVFor those of you who are not Chicagoans, that won't mean anything,
p49
aVbut if I didn't mention that I was a West Sider,
p50
aVthere would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset.
p51
aa(lp52
VThe neighborhood that I live in is Grand Crossing.
p53
aVIt's a neighborhood that has seen better days.
p54
aVIt is not a gated community by far.
p55
aVThere is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood,
p56
aVand while I was kind of busy making pots and busy making art
p57
aVand having a good art career,
p58
aVthere was all of this stuff that was happening
p59
aVjust outside my studio.
p60
aVAll of us know about failing housing markets
p61
aVand the challenges of blight,
p62
aVand I feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others,
p63
aVbut I think a lot of our U.S. cities and beyond
p64
aVhave the challenge of blight,
p65
aVabandoned buildings that people no longer know what to do anything with.
p66
aVAnd so I thought, is there a way that I could start to think
p67
aVabout these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice?
p68
aVAnd that if I was thinking along with other creatives \u2014
p69
aVarchitects, engineers, real estate finance people \u2014
p70
aVthat us together might be able to kind of think
p71
aVin more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd so I bought a building.
p74
aVThe building was really affordable.
p75
aVWe tricked it out.
p76
aVWe made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening
p77
aVon my block.
p78
aVOnce I bought the building for about 18,000 dollars,
p79
aVI didn't have any money left.
p80
aVSo I started sweeping the building as a kind of performance.
p81
aVThis is performance art, and people would come over,
p82
aVand I would start sweeping.
p83
aVBecause the broom was free and sweeping was free.
p84
aVIt worked out.
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVBut we would use the building, then, to stage exhibitions, small dinners,
p87
aVand we found that that building on my block, Dorchester \u2014
p88
aVwe now referred to the block as Dorchester projects \u2014
p89
aVthat in a way that building became a kind of gathering site
p90
aVfor lots of different kinds of activity.
p91
aVWe turned the building into what we called now the Archive House.
p92
aVThe Archive House would do all of these amazing things.
p93
aVVery significant people in the city and beyond
p94
aVwould find themselves in the middle of the hood.
p95
aVAnd that's when I felt like
p96
aVmaybe there was a relationship between my history with clay
p97
aVand this new thing that was starting to develop,
p98
aVthat we were slowly starting
p99
aVto reshape how people imagined the South Side of the city.
p100
aa(lp101
VOne house turned into a few houses,
p102
aVand we always tried to suggest
p103
aVthat not only is creating a beautiful vessel important,
p104
aVbut the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important.
p105
aVSo we were not only thinking about development,
p106
aVbut we were thinking about the program,
p107
aVthinking about the kind of connections that could happen
p108
aVbetween one house and another, between one neighbor and another.
p109
aVThis building became what we call the Listening House,
p110
aVand it has a collection of discarded books
p111
aVfrom the Johnson Publishing Corporation,
p112
aVand other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business.
p113
aVI was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as I could
p114
aVwith whatever and whoever would join me.
p115
aa(lp116
VIn Chicago, there's amazing building stock.
p117
aVThis building, which had been the former crack house on the block,
p118
aVand when the building became abandoned,
p119
aVit became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there.
p120
aVSo this space we converted into what we call Black Cinema House.
p121
aVBlack Cinema House was an opportunity in the hood to screen films
p122
aVthat were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me,
p123
aVthat if we wanted to show an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.
p124
aVIf we wanted to show "Car Wash," we could.
p125
aVThat would be awesome.
p126
aVThe building we soon outgrew,
p127
aVand we had to move to a larger space.
p128
aVBlack Cinema House, which was made from just a small piece of clay,
p129
aVhad to grow into a much larger piece of clay, which is now my studio.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat I realized was that for those of you who are zoning junkies,
p132
aVthat some of the things that I was doing
p133
aVin these buildings that had been left behind,
p134
aVthey were not the uses by which the buildings were built,
p135
aVand that there are city policies that say,
p136
aV"Hey, a house that is residential needs to stay residential."
p137
aVBut what do you do in neighborhoods when ain't nobody interested in living there?
p138
aVThat the people who have the means to leave have already left?
p139
aVWhat do we do with these abandoned buildings?
p140
aVAnd so I was trying to wake them up using culture.
p141
aa(lp142
VWe found that that was so exciting for folk,
p143
aVand people were so responsive to the work, that we had to then find bigger buildings.
p144
aVBy the time we found bigger buildings,
p145
aVthere was, in part, the resources  necessary to think about those things.
p146
aVIn this bank that we called the Arts Bank, it was in pretty bad shape.
p147
aVThere was about six feet of standing water.
p148
aVIt was a difficult project to finance,
p149
aVbecause banks weren't interested in the neighborhood
p150
aVbecause people weren't interested in the neighborhood
p151
aVbecause nothing had happened there.
p152
aVIt was dirt. It was nothing. It was nowhere.
p153
aVAnd so we just started imagining, what else could happen in this building?
p154
aV(Applause)
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd so now that the rumor of my block has spread,
p157
aVand lots of people are starting to visit,
p158
aVwe've found that the bank can now be a center
p159
aVfor exhibition, archives, music performance,
p160
aVand that there are people who are now interested
p161
aVin being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat,
p162
aVthat we kind of made a fire.
p163
aa(lp164
VOne of the archives that we'll have there is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.
p165
aVWe've also started to collect memorabilia from American history,
p166
aVfrom people who live or have lived in that neighborhood.
p167
aVSome of these images are degraded images of black people,
p168
aVkind of histories of very challenging content,
p169
aVand where better than a neighborhood
p170
aVwith young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity
p171
aVto talk about some of the complexities
p172
aVof race and class?
p173
aa(lp174
VIn some ways, the bank represents a hub,
p175
aVthat we're trying to create a pretty  hardcore node of cultural activity,
p176
aVand that if we could start to make multiple hubs
p177
aVand connect some cool green stuff around there,
p178
aVthat the buildings that we've purchased and rehabbed,
p179
aVwhich is now around 60 or 70 units,
p180
aVthat if we could land miniature Versailles on top of that,
p181
aVand connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt \u2014
p182
aV(Applause) \u2014
p183
aVthat this place where people never wanted to be
p184
aVwould become an important destination
p185
aVfor folk from all over the country and world.
p186
aa(lp187
VIn some ways, it feels very much like I'm a potter,
p188
aVthat we tackle the things that are at our wheel,
p189
aVwe try with the skill that we have
p190
aVto think about this next bowl that I want to make.
p191
aVAnd it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood
p192
aVto a cultural district to thinking about the city,
p193
aVand at every point, there were things that I didn't know that I had to learn.
p194
aVI've never learned so much about zoning law in my life.
p195
aVI never thought I'd have to.
p196
aVBut as a result of that, I'm finding that there's not just room
p197
aVfor my own artistic practice,
p198
aVthere's room for a lot of other artistic practices.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo people started asking us,
p201
aV"Well, Theaster, how are you going to go to scale?"
p202
aVand, "What's your sustainability plan?"
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd what I found was that I couldn't export myself,
p207
aVthat what seems necessary in cities like Akron, Ohio,
p208
aVand Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,
p209
aVis that there are people in those places who already believe in those places,
p210
aVthat are already dying to make those places beautiful,
p211
aVand that often, those people who are passionate about a place
p212
aVare disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen,
p213
aVor disconnected from a contingency of people
p214
aVthat could help make things happen.
p215
aVSo now, we're starting to give advice around the country
p216
aVon how to start with what you got,
p217
aVhow to start with the things that are in front of you,
p218
aVhow to make something out of nothing,
p219
aVhow to reshape your world at a wheel or at your block
p220
aVor at the scale of the city.
p221
aa(lp222
VThank you so much.
p223
aa(lp224
V(Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VJune Cohen: Thank you. So I think many people watching this
p227
aVwill be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end:
p228
aVHow can they do this in their own city?
p229
aVYou can't export yourself.
p230
aVGive us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired
p231
aVabout their city can do to take on projects like yours?
p232
aa(lp233
VTheaster Gates: One of the things I've found that's really important
p234
aVis giving thought to not just the kind of individual project,
p235
aVlike an old house,
p236
aVbut what's the relationship between an old house,
p237
aVa local school, a small bodega,
p238
aVand is there some kind of synergy between those things?
p239
aVCan you get those folk talking?
p240
aVI've found that in cases where neighborhoods have failed,
p241
aVthey still often have a pulse.
p242
aVHow do you identify the pulse in that place, the passionate people,
p243
aVand then how do you get folk who have been fighting,
p244
aVslogging for 20 years, reenergized about the place that they live?
p245
aVAnd so someone has to do that work.
p246
aVIf I were a traditional developer, I would be talking about buildings alone,
p247
aVand then putting a "For Lease" sign in the window.
p248
aVI think that you actually have to curate more than that,
p249
aVthat there's a way in which you have to be mindful about,
p250
aVwhat are the businesses that I want to grow here?
p251
aVAnd then, are there people who live in this place
p252
aVwho want to grow those businesses with me?
p253
aVBecause I think it's not just a cultural space or housing;
p254
aVthere has to be the recreation of an economic core.
p255
aVSo thinking about those things together feels right.
p256
aa(lp257
VJC: It's hard to get people to create the spark again
p258
aVwhen people have been slogging for 20 years.
p259
aVAre there any methods you've found that have helped break through?
p260
aa(lp261
VTG: Yeah, I think that now there are lots of examples
p262
aVof folk who are doing amazing work,
p263
aVbut those methods are sometimes like, when the media is constantly saying
p264
aVthat only violent things happen in a place,
p265
aVthen based on your skill set and the particular context,
p266
aVwhat are the things that you can do in your neighborhood
p267
aVto kind of fight some of that?
p268
aVSo I've found that if you're a theater person,
p269
aVyou have outdoor street theater festivals.
p270
aVIn some cases, we don't have the resources in certain neighborhoods
p271
aVto do things that are a certain kind of splashy,
p272
aVbut if we can then find ways of making sure that people
p273
aVwho are local to a place,
p274
aVplus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally,
p275
aVwhen those people get together,
p276
aVI think really amazing things can happen.
p277
aa(lp278
VJC: So interesting.
p279
aVAnd how can you make sure that the projects you're creating
p280
aVare actually for the disadvantaged
p281
aVand not just for the sort of vegetarian indie movie crowd
p282
aVthat might move in to take advantage of them.
p283
aa(lp284
VTG: Right on. So I think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds.
p285
aa(lp286
VJC: Let's go there. TG: Right now, Grand Crossing
p287
aVis 99 percent black, or at least living,
p288
aVand we know that maybe who owns property in a place
p289
aVis different from who walks the streets every day.
p290
aVSo it's reasonable to say that Grand Crossing is already
p291
aVin the process of being something different than it is today.
p292
aVBut are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts
p293
aVor a mission-based development
p294
aVthat starts to protect some of the space that happens,
p295
aVbecause when you have 7,500 empty lots in a city,
p296
aVyou want something to happen there,
p297
aVbut you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece,
p298
aVbut entities that are interested in the stabilization piece,
p299
aVand I feel like often the developer piece is really motivated,
p300
aVbut the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness,
p301
aVthat part doesn't live anymore.
p302
aVSo how do you start to grow up important watchdogs
p303
aVthat ensure that the resources that are made available
p304
aVto new folk that are coming in
p305
aVare also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time.
p306
aa(lp307
VJC: That makes so much sense. One more question:
p308
aVYou make such a compelling case for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts.
p309
aVThere would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent
p310
aVon basic services for the disadvantaged.
p311
aVHow do you combat that viewpoint, or come against it?
p312
aa(lp313
VTG: I believe that beauty  is a basic service.
p314
aV(Applause)
p315
aVOften what I have found is that when there are resources
p316
aVthat have not been made available to certain under-resourced cities
p317
aVor neighborhoods or communities,
p318
aVthat sometimes culture is the thing that helps to ignite,
p319
aVand that I can't do everything,
p320
aVbut I think that there's a way in which if you can start with culture
p321
aVand get people kind of reinvested in their place,
p322
aVother kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow,
p323
aVand then people can make a demand that's a poetic demand,
p324
aVand the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities,
p325
aVthey also become very poetic.
p326
aa(lp327
VJC: It makes perfect sense to me.
p328
aVTheaster, thank you so much for being here with us today.
p329
aVThank you. Theaster Gates.
