VMy thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.
p4
aVI'm the Director of Nutrition Services
p5
aVfor the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees
p6
aVand 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
p7
aVI'm doing 7,100 meals a day
p8
aVand I've been doing it for two years,
p9
aVtrying to change how we feed kids in America.
p10
aVAnd that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
p11
aVThese are some of my kids with a salad bar.
p12
aVI put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
p13
aVEveryone says it couldn't be done.
p14
aVLittle kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,
p15
aVbig kids would spit in it \u2014 neither happened.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen I took over this, I tried to really figure out,
p18
aVlike, what my vision would be.
p19
aVHow do we really change children's relationship to food?
p20
aVAnd I'll tell you why we need to change it,
p21
aVbut we absolutely have to change it.
p22
aVAnd what I came to understand is,
p23
aVwe needed to teach children
p24
aVthe symbiotic relationship
p25
aVbetween a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
p26
aVAnd that if we don't do that, the antithesis,
p27
aValthough we've heard otherwise,
p28
aVis we're really going to become extinct,
p29
aVbecause we're feeding our children to death.
p30
aVThat's my premise.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
p33
aVAnd the reason this is happening, by and large,
p34
aVis because of our food system
p35
aVand the way the government commodifies food,
p36
aVthe way the government oversees our food,
p37
aVthe way the USDA puts food on kids' plates
p38
aVthat's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
p39
aVAnd by \u2014 tacitly, all of us send our kids,
p40
aVor grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school
p41
aVand tell them to learn, you know,
p42
aVlearn what's in those schools.
p43
aVAnd when you feed these kids bad food,
p44
aVthat's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
p47
aVWe now live in a country where most of us don't decide,
p48
aVby and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,
p49
aVwho brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
p50
aVThey control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
p51
aVThese are \u2014 10 companies
p52
aVcontrol much of what's in our grocery stores,
p53
aVmuch of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo when I started thinking about these issues
p56
aVand how I was going to change what kids ate,
p57
aVI really started focusing on what we would teach them.
p58
aVAnd the very first thing
p59
aVwas about regional food \u2014 trying to eat food
p60
aVfrom within our region.
p61
aVAnd clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,
p62
aVor when \u2014 as the fossil fuel is going away,
p63
aVas oil hits its peak oil,
p64
aVyou know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not
p65
aVwe should, or could, be moving food
p66
aV1,500 miles before we eat it.
p67
aVSo we talked to kids about that,
p68
aVand we really start to feed kids regional food.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd then we talk about organic food.
p71
aVNow, most school districts can't really afford organic food,
p72
aVbut we, as a nation,
p73
aVhave to start thinking about
p74
aVconsuming, growing and feeding our children
p75
aVfood that's not chock-full of chemicals.
p76
aVWe can't keep feeding our kids pesticides
p77
aVand herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
p78
aVWe can't keep doing that.
p79
aVYou know, it doesn't work.
p80
aVAnd the results of that are kids getting sick.
p81
aa(lp82
VOne of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
p83
aVSeventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America
p84
aVis consumed in animal husbandry.
p85
aVWe are feeding our kids antibiotics
p86
aVin beef and other animal protein every day.
p87
aVSeventy percent \u2014 it's unbelievable.
p88
aVAnd the result of it is, we have diseases.
p89
aVWe have things like E. coli that we can't fix,
p90
aVthat we can't make kids better when they get sick.
p91
aVAnd, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
p92
aVbut it's an issue in the food supply.
p93
aVOne of my favorite facts is that
p94
aVU.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
p95
aVThat means every one of us, and our children,
p96
aVconsumes what would equal a five-pound bag \u2014
p97
aVthose bags you have at home. If I had one here
p98
aVand ripped it open,
p99
aVand that pile I would have on the floor
p100
aVis what we consume and feed our children every year
p101
aVbecause of what goes into our food supply,
p102
aVbecause of the way we consume
p103
aVproduce in America.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe USDA allows these antibiotics,
p106
aVthese hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,
p107
aVand the USDA paid for this ad
p108
aVin Time magazine.
p109
aVOkay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,
p110
aVbut we know it wasn't good for you and me.
p111
aVAnd that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.
p112
aVAnd that has to change, you know.
p113
aVThe USDA cannot be seen as
p114
aVthe be-all and end-all of what we feed
p115
aVour kids and what's allowed.
p116
aVWe cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
p117
aVThe antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
p118
aVThat's what I really try and get people to understand.
p119
aVI really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.
p120
aVIt's consuming food in a way
p121
aVin which we'll still have a planet,
p122
aVin which kids will grow up to be healthy,
p123
aVand which really tries to mitigate
p124
aVall the negative impacts we're seeing.
p125
aVIt really is just a new idea.
p126
aVI mean, people toss around sustainability,
p127
aVbut we have to figure out what sustainability is.
p128
aa(lp129
VIn less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,
p130
aVwe've gone from being 200 \u2014
p131
aVbeing 100 percent, 95 percent farmers
p132
aVto less than 2 percent of farmers.
p133
aVWe now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers \u2014
p134
aV2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.
p135
aVAnd we spend 35,000 dollars
p136
aVon average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,
p137
aVand school districts spend 500 dollars a year
p138
aVfeeding a child.
p139
aVIt's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd what's happening is, we're getting sick.
p144
aVWe're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
p145
aVIt is about what we feed them.
p146
aVWhat goes in is what we are.
p147
aVWe really are what we eat.
p148
aVAnd if we continue down this path,
p149
aVif we continue to feed kids bad food,
p150
aVif we continue not to teach them what good food is,
p151
aVwhat's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?
p152
aVWhat's going to happen to our whole medical system?
p153
aVWhat's going to happen is,
p154
aVwe're going to have kids
p155
aVthat have a life less long than our own.
p156
aVThe CDC, the Center for Disease Control,
p157
aVhas said, of the children born in the year 2000 \u2014
p158
aVthose seven- and eight-year-olds today \u2014
p159
aVone out of every three Caucasians,
p160
aVone out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics
p161
aVare going to have diabetes in their lifetime.
p162
aVAnd if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,
p163
aVmost before they graduate high school.
p164
aVThis means that 40 or 45 percent
p165
aVof all school-aged children
p166
aVcould be insulin-dependent
p167
aVwithin a decade. Within a decade.
p168
aa(lp169
VWhat's going to happen?
p170
aVWell, the CDC has gone further to say
p171
aVthat those children born in the year 2000
p172
aVcould be the first generation
p173
aVin our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.
p174
aVAnd it's because of what we feed them.
p175
aVBecause eight-year-olds don't get to decide \u2014
p176
aVand if they do, you should be in therapy.
p177
aVYou know, we are responsible
p178
aVfor what kids eat.
p179
aVBut oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
p180
aVBig companies spend 20 billion dollars a year
p181
aVmarketing non-nutrient foods to kids.
p182
aV20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.
p183
aVThey spend 500 dollars
p184
aVfor every one dollar \u2014 500 dollars marketing foods
p185
aVthat kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar
p186
aVmarketing healthy, nutritious food.
p187
aVThe result of which is kids think they're going to die
p188
aVif they don't have chicken nuggets.
p189
aa(lp190
VYou know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.
p191
aVThis is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.
p192
aVAnd the one over there, that's bigger than my head,
p193
aVis what McDonald's and Burger King
p194
aVand those big companies think we should eat.
p195
aVAnd why can they serve that much?
p196
aVWhy can we have 29-cent Big Gulps
p197
aVand 99-cent double burgers?
p198
aVIt's because of the way the government commodifies food,
p199
aVand the cheap corn and cheap soy
p200
aVthat are pushed into our food supply
p201
aVthat makes these non-nutrient foods
p202
aVreally, really cheap.
p203
aVWhich is why I say it's a social justice issue.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,
p206
aV"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."
p207
aVWell, this is the food I found 24 months ago.
p208
aVThis is not even food.
p209
aVThis is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,
p210
aVcorn dogs,
p211
aVpizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.
p212
aVEverything came in plastic, in cardboard.
p213
aVThe only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.
p214
aVThe only working piece of equipment in my kitchen
p215
aVwas a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,
p216
aVit came frozen in a box.
p217
aVThe USDA allows this.
p218
aVThe USDA allows all of this stuff.
p219
aVIn case you can't tell, that's, like,
p220
aVpink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.
p221
aVChicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,
p222
aVcanned fruit cocktail \u2014 a reimbursable meal.
p223
aa(lp224
VThat's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.
p225
aVIt ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.
p226
aVAnd we, all of us,
p227
aVhave to understand
p228
aVthat this is about us,
p229
aVthat we can make a difference here.
p230
aVNow I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,
p231
aVbut I'm sure you're rich if you did.
p232
aVBut whoever decided that a chicken should look like
p233
aVa heart, a giraffe, a star?
p234
aVWell, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.
p235
aVAnd that they could figure it out,
p236
aVthat we could sell this stuff to kids.
p237
aVYou know, what's wrong with teaching kids
p238
aVthat chicken looks like chicken?
p239
aVBut this is what most schools serve.
p240
aVIn fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,
p241
aVas opposed to \u2014 this is what we try and serve.
p242
aa(lp243
VWe really need to change
p244
aVthis whole paradigm with kids and food.
p245
aVWe really have to teach children
p246
aVthat chicken is not a giraffe.
p247
aVYou know, that vegetables
p248
aVare actually colorful, that they have flavor,
p249
aVthat carrots grow in the ground,
p250
aVthat strawberries grow in the ground.
p251
aVThere's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.
p252
aVYou know, we have to change
p253
aVthe way we teach kids about these things.
p254
aVThere's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools
p255
aVdoing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools
p256
aVactually getting fresh food into schools.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.
p259
aVWe have no high-fructose corn syrup,
p260
aVno trans fats, no processed foods.
p261
aVWe're cooking from scratch every day.
p262
aVWe have 25 percent of our \u2014
p263
aV(Applause)
p264
aVthank you \u2014 25 percent of our stuff
p265
aVis organic and local. We cook.
p266
aVThose are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.
p267
aVevery day and go cook the food for the kids,
p268
aVbecause this is what we need to do.
p269
aVWe can't keep serving kids
p270
aVprocessed crap,
p271
aVfull of chemicals,
p272
aVand expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
p273
aVYou're not going to get the next generation,
p274
aVor the generation after, to be able to think like this
p275
aVif they're not nourished.
p276
aVIf they're eating
p277
aVchemicals all the time,
p278
aVthey're not going to be able to think.
p279
aVThey're not going to be smart.
p280
aVYou know what? They're just going to be sick.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow one of the things that \u2014 what happened when I went into Berkeley
p283
aVis I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,
p284
aVvery, very different, and I needed to market it.
p285
aVI came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.
p286
aVAnd these calendars really started to lay out my program.
p287
aVNow I'm in charge of all the cooking classes
p288
aVand all the gardening classes in our school district.
p289
aVSo this is a typical menu.
p290
aVThis is what we're serving this week at the schools.
p291
aVAnd you see these recipes on the side?
p292
aVThose are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.
p293
aVThey do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.
p294
aVThey also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.
p295
aVIf we're going to change children's relationship to food,
p296
aVit's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,
p297
aVhands-on experience \u2014 you're looking in cooking and gardening classes \u2014
p298
aVand academic curriculum to tie it all together.
p299
aa(lp300
VNow you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,
p301
aVand I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,
p302
aVthis upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.
p303
aVYou know, run up into the end of the rainbow,
p304
aVI don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.
p305
aVThis is available on my website in English and Spanish,
p306
aVand it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.
p307
aVThe really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.
p308
aVWe have to start changing this.
p309
aVWe have to make kids understand
p310
aVthat their food choices make a big difference.
p311
aVWe have cooking classes \u2014 we have cooking classrooms in our schools.
p312
aVAnd why this is so important is
p313
aVthat we now have grown a generation,
p314
aVmaybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals
p315
aVis eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car
p316
aVand one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.
p317
aVWhat are kids learning? Where is the family time?
p318
aVWhere is socialization? Where is discussion?
p319
aVWhere is learning to talk?
p320
aVYou know, we have to change it.
p321
aa(lp322
VI work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.
p323
aVEATWISE \u2014 Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.
p324
aVWe have to teach kids
p325
aVthat Coke and Pop Tarts
p326
aVaren't breakfast.
p327
aVWe have to teach kids that if they're on a diet
p328
aVof refined sugar,
p329
aVthey go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.
p330
aVAnd we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.
p331
aVWe have recycling in all of our schools.
p332
aVYou know, the things that we maybe do at home
p333
aVand think are so important,
p334
aVwe have to teach kids about in school.
p335
aVIt has to be so much a part of them
p336
aVthat they really get it.
p337
aVBecause, you know what, many of us
p338
aVare sort of at the end of our careers,
p339
aVand we need to be giving these kids \u2014
p340
aVthese young kids, the next generation \u2014
p341
aVthe tools to save themselves
p342
aVand save the planet.
p343
aa(lp344
VOne of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.
p345
aVI work with private companies
p346
aVwho are willing to do R & D with me,
p347
aVwho are willing to do distribution for me,
p348
aVwho are really willing to work to go into schools.
p349
aVSchools are underfunded.
p350
aVMost schools in America spend less
p351
aVthan 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
p352
aVThat comes down to under five dollars an hour.
p353
aVMost of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour
p354
aVfor babysitters when you have them.
p355
aVSo we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.
p356
aVAnd if we're going to change it,
p357
aVand change how we feed kids,
p358
aVwe really have to rethink that.
p359
aVSo, public and private partnerships,
p360
aVadvocacy groups, working with foundations.
p361
aVIn our school district, the way we afford this
p362
aVis our school district allocates .03 percent
p363
aVof the general fund
p364
aVtowards nutrition services. And I think if every school district
p365
aVallocated a half to one percent,
p366
aVwe could start to really fix this program.
p367
aa(lp368
VWe really need to change it.
p369
aVIt's going to take more money.
p370
aVOf course, it's not all about food; it's also about
p371
aVkids getting exercise.
p372
aVAnd one of the simple things we can do
p373
aVis put recess before lunch.
p374
aVIt's sort of this "duh" thing.
p375
aVYou know, if you have kids coming into lunch
p376
aVand all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,
p377
aVyou see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
p378
aVAnd then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.
p379
aVThese are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down
p380
aVwhen you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
p381
aVSo if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,
p382
aVbelieve me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.
p383
aa(lp384
VWe need to \u2014
p385
aVwe need to educate.
p386
aVWe need to educate the kids.
p387
aVWe need to educate the staff.
p388
aVI had 90 employees.
p389
aVTwo were supposed to be cooks \u2014 none could.
p390
aVAnd, you know, I'm not that better off now.
p391
aVBut we really have to educate.
p392
aVWe have to get academic institutions to start thinking
p393
aVabout ways to teach people how to cook again,
p394
aVbecause, of course, they don't \u2014
p395
aVbecause we've had this processed food in schools
p396
aVand institutions for so long.
p397
aVWe need 40-minute lunches \u2014
p398
aVmost schools have 20-minute lunches \u2014
p399
aVand lunches that are time-appropriate.
p400
aVThere was just a big study done, and so many schools
p401
aVare starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.
p402
aVThat is not lunchtime.
p403
aa(lp404
VYou know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.
p405
aVAnd just remember,
p406
aVat very least tacitly,
p407
aVthis is what we're teaching children
p408
aVas what they should be doing.
p409
aVI think if we're going to fix this,
p410
aVone of the things we have to do
p411
aVis really change how we have oversight
p412
aVover the National School Lunch Program.
p413
aVInstead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,
p414
aVI think it should be under CDC.
p415
aVIf we started to think about food
p416
aVand how we feed our kids
p417
aVas a health initiative,
p418
aVand we started thinking about food as health,
p419
aVthen I think we wouldn't have corn dogs
p420
aVas lunch.
p421
aa(lp422
VOkay, Finance 101 on this,
p423
aVand this \u2014 I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,
p424
aVbecause I think this is something we all have to understand.
p425
aVThe National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
p426
aVfeeding 30 million children a year.
p427
