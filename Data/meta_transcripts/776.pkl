VIf you are a blind child in India,
p4
aVyou will very likely have to contend with
p5
aVat least two big pieces of bad news.
p6
aVThe first bad news
p7
aVis that the chances of getting treatment
p8
aVare extremely slim to none,
p9
aVand that's because most of the blindness
p10
aValleviation programs in the country
p11
aVare focused on adults,
p12
aVand there are very, very few hospitals
p13
aVthat are actually equipped to treat children.
p14
aVIn fact, if you were to be treated,
p15
aVyou might well end up being treated
p16
aVby a person who has no medical credentials
p17
aVas this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
p18
aVThis is a three-year-old orphan girl
p19
aVwho had cataracts.
p20
aVSo, her caretakers took her
p21
aVto the village medicine man,
p22
aVand instead of suggesting to the caretakers
p23
aVthat the girl be taken to a hospital,
p24
aVthe person decided to burn her abdomen
p25
aVwith red-hot iron bars
p26
aVto drive out the demons.
p27
aVThe second piece of bad news
p28
aVwill be delivered to you
p29
aVby neuroscientists, who will tell you
p30
aVthat if you are older than four or five years of age,
p31
aVthat even if you have your eye corrected,
p32
aVthe chances of your brain learning how to see
p33
aVare very, very slim \u2014
p34
aVagain, slim or none.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo when I heard these two things,
p37
aVit troubled me deeply,
p38
aVboth because of personal reasons
p39
aVand scientific reasons.
p40
aVSo let me first start with the personal reason.
p41
aVIt'll sound corny, but it's sincere.
p42
aVThat's my son, Darius.
p43
aVAs a new father,
p44
aVI have a qualitatively different sense
p45
aVof just how delicate babies are,
p46
aVwhat our obligations are towards them
p47
aVand how much love
p48
aVwe can feel towards a child.
p49
aVI would move heaven and earth
p50
aVin order to get treatment for Darius,
p51
aVand for me to be told
p52
aVthat there might be other Dariuses
p53
aVwho are not getting treatment,
p54
aVthat's just viscerally wrong.
p55
aVSo that's the personal reason.
p56
aa(lp57
VScientific reason is that this notion
p58
aVfrom neuroscience of critical periods \u2014
p59
aVthat if the brain is older
p60
aVthan four or five years of age,
p61
aVit loses its ability to learn \u2014
p62
aVthat doesn't sit well with me,
p63
aVbecause I don't think that idea
p64
aVhas been tested adequately.
p65
aVThe birth of the idea is from
p66
aVDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,
p67
aVtwo researchers who were at Harvard,
p68
aVand they got the Nobel Prize in 1981
p69
aVfor their studies of visual physiology,
p70
aVwhich are remarkably beautiful studies,
p71
aVbut I believe some of their work
p72
aVhas been extrapolated
p73
aVinto the human domain prematurely.
p74
aVSo, they did their work with kittens,
p75
aVwith different kinds of deprivation regiments,
p76
aVand those studies,
p77
aVwhich date back to the '60s,
p78
aVare now being applied to human children.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo I felt that I needed to do two things.
p81
aVOne: provide care
p82
aVto children who are currently
p83
aVbeing deprived of treatment.
p84
aVThat's the humanitarian mission.
p85
aVAnd the scientific mission would be
p86
aVto test the limits
p87
aVof visual plasticity.
p88
aVAnd these two missions, as you can tell,
p89
aVthread together perfectly. One adds to the other;
p90
aVin fact, one would be impossible without the other.
p91
aVSo, to implement
p92
aVthese twin missions,
p93
aVa few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
p94
aVPrakash, as many of you know,
p95
aVis the Sanskrit word for light,
p96
aVand the idea is that
p97
aVin bringing light into the lives of children,
p98
aVwe also have a chance
p99
aVof shedding light on some of the
p100
aVdeepest mysteries of neuroscience.
p101
aVAnd the logo \u2014 even though it looks extremely Irish,
p102
aVit's actually derived from
p103
aVthe Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
p104
aVThe Prakash, the overall effort
p105
aVhas three components:
p106
aVoutreach, to identify children in need of care;
p107
aVmedical treatment; and in subsequent study.
p108
aVAnd I want to show you a short video clip
p109
aVthat illustrates the first two components of this work.
p110
aa(lp111
VThis is an outreach station
p112
aVconducted at a school for the blind.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)
p115
aa(lp116
VPawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,
p117
aVmany children have permanent conditions.
p118
aVThat's a case of microphthalmos,
p119
aVwhich is malformed eyes,
p120
aVand that's a permanent condition;
p121
aVit cannot be treated.
p122
aVThat's an extreme of micropthalmos
p123
aVcalled enophthalmos.
p124
aVBut, every so often, we come across children
p125
aVwho show some residual vision,
p126
aVand that is a very good sign
p127
aVthat the condition might actually be treatable.
p128
aVSo, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
p129
aVThat's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,
p130
aVthe Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
p131
aVIt has a very well-equipped
p132
aVpediatric ophthalmic center,
p133
aVwhich was made possible in part
p134
aVby a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
p135
aVSo, eating burgers actually helps.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve
p138
aVeye-health in many children, and ...
p139
aV... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)
p140
aa(lp141
VPS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,
p142
aVyou will see the cause of his blindness.
p143
aVThe whites that you see in the middle of his pupils
p144
aVare congenital cataracts,
p145
aVso opacities of the lens.
p146
aVIn our eyes, the lens is clear,
p147
aVbut in this child, the lens has become opaque,
p148
aVand therefore he can't see the world.
p149
aVSo, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.
p150
aVHere's the eye with the opaque lens,
p151
aVthe opaque lens extracted
p152
aVand an acrylic lens inserted.
p153
aVAnd here's the same child
p154
aVthree weeks post-operation,
p155
aVwith the right eye open.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VThank you.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense
p162
aVthat recovery is possible,
p163
aVand we have now
p164
aVprovided treatment to over 200 children,
p165
aVand the story repeats itself.
p166
aVAfter treatment, the child
p167
aVgains significant functionality.
p168
aVIn fact, the story holds true
p169
aVeven if you have a person who got sight
p170
aVafter several years of deprivation.
p171
aVWe did a paper a few years ago
p172
aVabout this woman that you see on the right, SRD,
p173
aVand she got her sight late in life,
p174
aVand her vision is remarkable at this age.
p175
aVI should add a tragic postscript to this \u2014
p176
aVshe died two years ago
p177
aVin a bus accident.
p178
aVSo, hers is just a truly inspiring story \u2014
p179
aVunknown, but inspiring story.
p180
aVSo when we started finding these results,
p181
aVas you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir
p182
aVin the scientific and the popular press.
p183
aVHere's an article in Nature
p184
aVthat profiled this work,
p185
aVand another one in Time.
p186
aVSo, we were fairly convinced \u2014 we are convinced \u2014
p187
aVthat recovery is feasible,
p188
aVdespite extended visual deprivation.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe next obvious question to ask:
p191
aVWhat is the process of recovery?
p192
aVSo, the way we study that is,
p193
aVlet's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.
p194
aVThe child is provided treatment,
p195
aVand I want to stress that the treatment
p196
aVis completely unconditional;
p197
aVthere is no quid pro quo.
p198
aVWe treat many more children then we actually work with.
p199
aVEvery child who needs treatment is treated.
p200
aVAfter treatment, about every week,
p201
aVwe run the child
p202
aVon a battery of simple visual tests
p203
aVin order to see how their visual skills
p204
aVare coming on line.
p205
aVAnd we try to do this for as long as possible.
p206
aVThis arc of development
p207
aVgives us unprecedented
p208
aVand extremely valuable information
p209
aVabout how the scaffolding of vision
p210
aVgets set up.
p211
aVWhat might be the causal connections
p212
aVbetween the early developing skills
p213
aVand the later developing ones?
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd we've used this general approach to study
p216
aVmany different visual proficiencies,
p217
aVbut I want to highlight one particular one,
p218
aVand that is image parsing into objects.
p219
aVSo, any image of the kind that you see on the left,
p220
aVbe it a real image or a synthetic image,
p221
aVit's made up of little regions
p222
aVthat you see in the middle column,
p223
aVregions of different colors, different luminances.
p224
aVThe brain has this complex task
p225
aVof putting together, integrating,
p226
aVsubsets of these regions
p227
aVinto something that's more meaningful,
p228
aVinto what we would consider to be objects,
p229
aVas you see on the right.
p230
aVAnd nobody knows how this integration happens,
p231
aVand that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo, here's what happens
p234
aVvery soon after the onset of sight.
p235
aVHere's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,
p236
aVand you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,
p237
aVrunning the experiment with him.
p238
aVHis visual-motor coordination is quite poor,
p239
aVbut you get a general sense
p240
aVof what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
p241
aVIf you show him real world images,
p242
aVif you show others like him real world images,
p243
aVthey are unable to recognize most of the objects
p244
aVbecause the world to them is over-fragmented;
p245
aVit's made up of a collage, a patchwork,
p246
aVof regions of different colors and luminances.
p247
aVAnd that's what's indicated in the green outlines.
p248
aVWhen you ask them,
p249
aV"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,"
p250
aVthese are the regions that they point to.
p251
aVSo the world is this complex
p252
aVpatchwork of regions.
p253
aVEven the shadow on the ball
p254
aVbecomes its own object.
p255
aVInterestingly enough,
p256
aVyou give them a few months,
p257
aVand this is what happens.
p258
aa(lp259
VDoctor: How many are these?
p260
aa(lp261
VPatient: These are two things.
p262
aa(lp263
VDoctor: What are their shapes?
p264
aa(lp265
VPatient: Their shapes ...
p266
aVThis one is a circle,
p267
aVand this
p268
aVis a square.
p269
aa(lp270
VPS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.
p271
aVAnd the question is:
p272
aVWhat underlies this transformation?
p273
aVIt's a profound question,
p274
aVand what's even more amazing is how simple
p275
aVthe answer is.
p276
aVThe answer lies in motion
p277
aVand that's what I want to show you in the next clip.
p278
aa(lp279
VDoctor: What shape do you see here?
p280
aa(lp281
VPatient: I can't make it out.
p282
aa(lp283
VDoctor: Now?
p284
aa(lp285
VPatient: Triangle.
p286
aa(lp287
VDoctor: How many things are these?
p288
aVNow, how many things are these?
p289
aa(lp290
VPatient: Two.
p291
aa(lp292
VDoctor: What are these things?
p293
aa(lp294
VPatient: A square and a circle.
p295
aa(lp296
VPS: And we see this pattern over and over again.
p297
aVThe one thing the visual system needs
p298
aVin order to begin parsing the world
p299
aVis dynamic information.
p300
aVSo the inference we are deriving from this,
p301
aVand several such experiments,
p302
aVis that dynamic information processing,
p303
aVor motion processing,
p304
aVserves as the bedrock for building
p305
aVthe rest of the complexity of visual processing;
p306
aVit leads to visual integration
p307
aVand eventually to recognition.
p308
aa(lp309
VThis simple idea has far reaching implications.
p310
aVAnd let me just quickly mention two,
p311
aVone, drawing from the domain of engineering,
p312
aVand one from the clinic.
p313
aVSo, from the perspective of engineering,
p314
aVwe can ask: Goven that we know
p315
aVthat motion is so important for the human visual system,
p316
aVcan we use this as a recipe
p317
aVfor constructing machine-based vision systems
p318
aVthat can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed
p319
aVby a human programmer?
p320
aVAnd that's what we're trying to do.
p321
aa(lp322
VI'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply
p323
aVwhatever basic knowledge you gain.
p324
aVSo we are creating Dylan,
p325
aVwhich is a computational system
p326
aVwith an ambitious goal
p327
aVof taking in visual inputs
p328
aVof the same kind that a human child would receive,
p329
aVand autonomously discovering:
p330
aVWhat are the objects in this visual input?
p331
aVSo, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.
p332
aVHere, I'm just going to talk about
p333
aVhow we test Dylan.
p334
aVThe way we test Dylan is by giving it
p335
aVinputs, as I said, of the same kind
p336
aVthat a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.
p337
aVBut for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:
p338
aVWow can we get these kinds of video inputs?
p339
aVSo, I thought,
p340
aVcould we have Darius
p341
aVserve as our babycam carrier,
p342
aVand that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?
p343
aVSo that's what we did.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aVI had to have long conversations with my wife.
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aVIn fact, Pam, if you're watching this,
p348
aVplease forgive me.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, we modified the optics of the camera
p351
aVin order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.
p352
aVAs some of you might know,
p353
aVbabyies are born pretty much legally blind.
p354
aVTheir acuity \u2014 our acuity is 20/20;
p355
aVbabies' acuity is like 20/800,
p356
aVso they are looking at the world
p357
aVin a very, very blurry fashion.
p358
aVHere's what a baby-cam video looks like.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VThankfully, there isn't any audio
p364
aVto go with this.
p365
aVWhat's amazing is that working with such
p366
aVhighly degraded input,
p367
aVthe baby, very quickly, is able
p368
aVto discover meaning in such input.
p369
aVBut then two or three days afterward,
p370
aVbabies begin to pay attention
p371
aVto their mother's or their father's face.
p372
aVHow does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,
p373
aVand using this mantra of motion,
p374
aVDylan actually can do that.
p375
aVSo, given that kind of video input,
p376
aVwith just about six or seven minutes worth of video,
p377
aVDylan can begin to extract patterns
p378
aVthat include faces.
p379
aVSo, it's an important demonstration
p380
aVof the power of motion.
p381
aa(lp382
VThe clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.
p383
aVVisual integration has been associated with autism
p384
aVby several researchers.
p385
aVWhen we saw that, we asked:
p386
aVCould the impairment in visual integration
p387
aVbe the manifestation of something underneath,
p388
aVof dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
p389
aVBecause, if that hypothesis were to be true,
p390
aVit would have massive repercussions in our understanding
p391
aVof what's causing the many different aspects
p392
aVof the autism phenotype.
p393
aa(lp394
VWhat you're going to see are
p395
aVvideo clips of two children \u2014 one neurotypical,
p396
aVone with autism, playing Pong.
p397
aVSo, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.
p398
aVIn red are the eye movement traces.
p399
aVThis is the neurotypical child, and what you see
p400
aVis that the child is able to make cues
p401
aVof the dynamic information
p402
aVto predict where the ball is going to go.
p403
aVEven before the ball gets to a place,
p404
aVthe child is already looking there.
p405
aVContrast this with a child
p406
aVwith autism playing the same game.
p407
aVInstead of anticipating,
p408
aVthe child always follows where the ball has been.
p409
aVThe efficiency of the use
p410
aVof dynamic information
p411
aVseems to be significantly compromised in autism.
p412
aVSo we are pursuing this line of work
p413
aVand hopefully we'll have
p414
aVmore results to report soon.
p415
aa(lp416
VLooking ahead, if you think of this disk
p417
aVas representing all of the children
p418
aVwe've treated so far,
p419
aVthis is the magnitude of the problem.
p420
aVThe red dots are the children we have not treated.
p421
aVSo, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,
p422
aVand in order to expand the scope of the project,
p423
aVwe are planning on launching
p424
aVThe Prakash Center for Children,
p425
aVwhich will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,
p426
aVa school for the children we are treating
p427
aVand also a cutting-edge research facility.
p428
aVThe Prakash Center will integrate health care,
p429
aVeducation and research in a way
p430
aVthat truly creates the whole
p431
aVto be greater than the sum of the parts.
p432
aa(lp433
VSo, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,
p434
aVit's had an impact in multiple areas,
p435
aVranging from basic neuroscience
p436
aVplasticity and learning in the brain,
p437
aVto clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,
p438
aVthe development of autonomous machine vision systems,
p439
aVeducation of the undergraduate and graduate students,
p440
aVand most importantly in the alleviation
p441
aVof childhood blindness.
p442
aVAnd for my students and I, it's been
p443
aVjust a phenomenal experience
p444
aVbecause we have gotten to do interesting research,
p445
aVwhile at the same time
p446
aVhelping the many children that we have worked with.
p447
