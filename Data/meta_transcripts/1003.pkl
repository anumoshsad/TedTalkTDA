VToday I want to talk to you
p4
aVabout ethnic conflict
p5
aVand civil war.
p6
aVThese are not normally the most cheerful of topics,
p7
aVnor do they generally generate
p8
aVthe kind of good news
p9
aVthat this conference is about.
p10
aVYet, not only is there at least some good news
p11
aVto be told about fewer such conflicts now
p12
aVthan two decades ago,
p13
aVbut what is perhaps more important
p14
aVis that we also have come
p15
aVto a much better understanding of what can be done
p16
aVto further reduce the number
p17
aVof ethnic conflicts and civil wars
p18
aVand the suffering that they inflict.
p19
aVThree things stand out:
p20
aVleadership, diplomacy
p21
aVand institutional design.
p22
aVWhat I will focus on in my talk
p23
aVis why they matter, how they matter,
p24
aVand what we can all do
p25
aVto make sure that they continue to matter
p26
aVin the right ways,
p27
aVthat is, how all of us can contribute
p28
aVto developing and honing the skills
p29
aVof local and global leaders
p30
aVto make peace
p31
aVand to make it last.
p32
aVBut let's start at the beginning.
p33
aa(lp34
VCivil wars have made news headlines
p35
aVfor many decades now,
p36
aVand ethnic conflicts in particular
p37
aVhave been a near constant presence
p38
aVas a major international security threat.
p39
aVFor nearly two decades now,
p40
aVthe news has been bad
p41
aVand the images have been haunting.
p42
aVIn Georgia, after years of stalemate,
p43
aVwe saw a full-scale resurgence of violence
p44
aVin August, 2008.
p45
aVThis quickly escalated into a five-day war
p46
aVbetween Russia and Georgia,
p47
aVleaving Georgia ever more divided.
p48
aVIn Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 \u2014
p49
aVwe just heard about them \u2014
p50
aVquickly led to high levels
p51
aVof inter-ethnic violence
p52
aVand the killing and displacement
p53
aVof thousands of people.
p54
aVIn Sri Lanka,
p55
aVa decades-long civil war
p56
aVbetween the Tamil minority
p57
aVand the Sinhala majority
p58
aVled to a bloody climax in 2009,
p59
aVafter perhaps as many as 100,000
p60
aVpeople had been killed
p61
aVsince 1983.
p62
aVIn Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,
p63
aVunprecedented levels of violence occurred
p64
aVbetween ethnic Kyrgyz
p65
aVand ethnic Uzbeks.
p66
aVHundreds have been killed,
p67
aVand more than 100,000 displaced,
p68
aVincluding many ethnic Uzbeks
p69
aVwho fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
p70
aVIn the Middle East,
p71
aVconflict between Israelis and Palestinians
p72
aVcontinues unabated,
p73
aVand it becomes ever more difficult
p74
aVto see how, just how
p75
aVa possible, sustainable solution
p76
aVcan be achieved.
p77
aVDarfur may have slipped from the news headlines,
p78
aVbut the killing and displacement there
p79
aVcontinues as well,
p80
aVand the sheer human misery that it creates
p81
aVis very hard to fathom.
p82
aVAnd in Iraq, finally,
p83
aVviolence is on the rise again,
p84
aVand the country has yet to form a government
p85
aVfour months after
p86
aVits last parliamentary elections.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
p89
aVSo are these now the images of the past?
p90
aVWell, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures
p91
aVfrom the Middle East, Darfur,
p92
aVIraq, elsewhere,
p93
aVthere is a longer-term trend
p94
aVthat does represent some good news.
p95
aVOver the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,
p96
aVthere has been an overall decline
p97
aVin the number of civil wars.
p98
aVSince the high in the early 1990s,
p99
aVwith about 50 such civil wars ongoing,
p100
aVwe now have 30 percent fewer
p101
aVsuch conflicts today.
p102
aVThe number of people killed in civil wars
p103
aValso is much lower today
p104
aVthan it was a decade ago or two.
p105
aVBut this trend is less unambiguous.
p106
aVThe highest level of deaths on the battlefield
p107
aVwas recorded between 1998 and 2001,
p108
aVwith about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels
p109
aVkilled every year.
p110
aVThe lowest number of combatant casualties
p111
aVoccurred in 2003,
p112
aVwith just 20,000 killed.
p113
aVDespite the up and down since then,
p114
aVthe overall trend \u2014
p115
aVand this is the important bit \u2014
p116
aVclearly points downward
p117
aVfor the past two decades.
p118
aa(lp119
VThe news about civilian casualties
p120
aVis also less bad than it used to be.
p121
aVFrom over 12,000 civilians
p122
aVdeliberately killed in civil wars
p123
aVin 1997 and 1998,
p124
aVa decade later,
p125
aVthis figure stands at 4,000.
p126
aVThis is a decrease by two-thirds.
p127
aVThis decline would be even more obvious
p128
aVif we factored in the genocide in Rwanda
p129
aVin 1994.
p130
aVBut then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered
p131
aVin a matter of just a few months.
p132
aVThis certainly is an accomplishment
p133
aVthat must never be surpassed.
p134
aVWhat is also important is to note
p135
aVthat these figures only tell part of the story.
p136
aVThey exclude people
p137
aVthat died as a consequence of civil war,
p138
aVfrom hunger or disease, for example.
p139
aVAnd they also do not properly account
p140
aVfor civilian suffering more generally.
p141
aVTorture, rape and ethnic cleansing
p142
aVhave become highly effective,
p143
aVif often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.
p144
aVTo put it differently,
p145
aVfor the civilians that suffer the consequences
p146
aVof ethnic conflict and civil war,
p147
aVthere is no good war
p148
aVand there is no bad peace.
p149
aVThus, even though every civilian killed,
p150
aVmaimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,
p151
aVthe fact that the number
p152
aVof civilian casualties
p153
aVis clearly lower today
p154
aVthan it was a decade ago,
p155
aVis good news.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo, we have fewer conflicts today
p158
aVin which fewer people get killed.
p159
aVAnd the big question, of course,
p160
aVis why?
p161
aVIn some cases,
p162
aVthere is a military victory of one side.
p163
aVThis is a solution of sorts,
p164
aVbut rarely is it one
p165
aVthat comes without human costs
p166
aVor humanitarian consequences.
p167
aVThe defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
p168
aVis perhaps the most recent example of this,
p169
aVbut we have seen similar
p170
aVso-called military solutions
p171
aVin the Balkans, in the South Caucasus
p172
aVand across most of Africa.
p173
aVAt times, they are complimented
p174
aVby negotiated settlements,
p175
aVor at least cease-fire agreements,
p176
aVand peacekeepers are deployed.
p177
aVBut hardly ever do they represent
p178
aVa resounding success \u2014
p179
aVBosnia and Herzegovina
p180
aVperhaps more so than Georgia.
p181
aVBut for many parts of Africa,
p182
aVa colleague of mine once put it this way,
p183
aV"The cease-fire on Tuesday night
p184
aVwas reached just in time
p185
aVfor the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."
p186
aa(lp187
VBut let's look at the good news again.
p188
aVIf there's no solution on the battlefield,
p189
aVthree factors can account
p190
aVfor the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,
p191
aVor for sustainable peace afterwards:
p192
aVleadership, diplomacy
p193
aVand institutional design.
p194
aVTake the example of Northern Ireland.
p195
aVDespite centuries of animosity,
p196
aVdecades of violence
p197
aVand thousands of people killed,
p198
aV1998 saw the conclusion
p199
aVof an historic agreement.
p200
aVIts initial version was skillfully mediated
p201
aVby Senator George Mitchell.
p202
aVCrucially, for the long-term success
p203
aVof the peace process in Northern Ireland,
p204
aVhe imposed very clear conditions
p205
aVfor the participation and negotiations.
p206
aVCentral among them,
p207
aVa commitment
p208
aVto exclusively peaceful means.
p209
aVSubsequent revisions of the agreement
p210
aVwere facilitated by the British and Irish governments,
p211
aVwho never wavered in their determination
p212
aVto bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.
p213
aa(lp214
VThe core institutions
p215
aVthat were put in place in 1998
p216
aVand their modifications
p217
aVin 2006 and 2008
p218
aVwere highly innovative
p219
aVand allowed all conflict parties
p220
aVto see their core concerns and demands addressed.
p221
aVThe agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement
p222
aVin Northern Ireland
p223
aVwith cross-border institutions
p224
aVthat link Belfast and Dublin
p225
aVand thus recognizes
p226
aVthe so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.
p227
aVAnd significantly,
p228
aVthere's also a clear focus
p229
aVon both the rights of individuals
p230
aVand the rights of communities.
p231
aVThe provisions in the agreement may be complex,
p232
aVbut so is the underlying conflict.
p233
aVPerhaps most importantly,
p234
aVlocal leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,
p235
aVnot always fast
p236
aVand not always enthusiastically,
p237
aVbut rise in the end they did.
p238
aVWho ever could have imagined
p239
aVIan Paisley and Martin McGuinness
p240
aVjointly governing Northern Ireland
p241
aVas First and Deputy First Minister?
p242
aa(lp243
VBut then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,
p244
aVor does this kind of explanation
p245
aVonly hold more generally
p246
aVin democratic and developed countries?
p247
aVBy no means.
p248
aVThe ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war
p249
aVin 2003
p250
aVillustrates the importance
p251
aVof leadership, diplomacy
p252
aVand institutional design
p253
aVas much as the successful prevention
p254
aVof a full-scale civil war
p255
aVin Macedonia in 2001,
p256
aVor the successful ending
p257
aVof the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.
p258
aVIn all three cases,
p259
aVlocal leaders were willing and able
p260
aVto make peace,
p261
aVthe international community stood ready
p262
aVto help them negotiate and implement an agreement,
p263
aVand the institutions have lived up
p264
aVto the promise that they held
p265
aVon the day they were agreed.
p266
aa(lp267
VFocusing on leadership, diplomacy
p268
aVand institutional design
p269
aValso helps explain failures to achieve peace,
p270
aVor to make it last.
p271
aVThe hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords
p272
aVdid not lead to an end
p273
aVof the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
p274
aVNot all the issues that needed to be resolved
p275
aVwere actually covered in the agreements.
p276
aVRather, local leaders committed
p277
aVto revisiting them later on.
p278
aVYet instead of grasping this opportunity,
p279
aVlocal and international leaders
p280
aVsoon disengaged
p281
aVand became distracted
p282
aVby the second Intifada, the events of 9/11
p283
aVand the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
p284
aa(lp285
VThe comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan
p286
aVsigned in 2005
p287
aVturned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,
p288
aVand its provisions may yet bear the seeds
p289
aVof a full-scale return to war
p290
aVbetween north and south.
p291
aVChanges and shortcomings in leadership,
p292
aVmore off than on international diplomacy
p293
aVand institutional failures
p294
aVaccount for this
p295
aVin almost equal measure.
p296
aVUnresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,
p297
aVthe ongoing conflict in Darfur,
p298
aVescalating tribal violence in the south
p299
aVand generally weak state capacity
p300
aVacross all of Sudan
p301
aVcomplete a very depressing picture
p302
aVof the state of affairs
p303
aVin Africa's largest country.
p304
aa(lp305
VA final example: Kosovo.
p306
aVThe failure to achieve
p307
aVa negotiated solution for Kosovo
p308
aVand the violence, tension
p309
aVand de facto partition that resulted from it
p310
aVhave their reasons
p311
aVin many, many different factors.
p312
aVCentral among them are three.
p313
aVFirst, the intransigence of local leaders
p314
aVto settle for nothing less
p315
aVthan their maximum demands.
p316
aVSecond, an international diplomatic effort
p317
aVthat was hampered from the beginning
p318
aVby Western support for Kosovo's independence.
p319
aVAnd third, a lack of imagination
p320
aVwhen it came to designing institutions
p321
aVthat could have addressed the concerns
p322
aVof Serbs and Albanians alike.
p323
aVBy the same token \u2014
p324
aVand here we have some good news again \u2014
p325
aVthe very fact that there is a high-level,
p326
aVwell-resourced international presence
p327
aVin Kosovo
p328
aVand the Balkans region more generally
p329
aVand the fact that local leaders on both sides
p330
aVhave showed relative restraint,
p331
aVexplains why things have not been worse
p332
aVover the past two years since 2008.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo even in situations
p335
aVwhere outcomes are less than optimal,
p336
aVlocal leaders
p337
aVand international leaders have a choice,
p338
aVand they can make a difference for the better.
p339
aVA cold war
p340
aVis not as good
p341
aVas a cold peace,
p342
aVbut a cold peace
p343
aVis still better than a hot war.
p344
aVGood news is also about learning the right lesson.
p345
aVSo what then distinguishes
p346
aVthe Israeli/Palestinian conflict
p347
aVfrom that in Northern Ireland,
p348
aVor the civil war in Sudan
p349
aVfrom that in Liberia?
p350
aVBoth successes and failures
p351
aVteach us several critically important things
p352
aVthat we need to bear in mind
p353
aVif we want the good news to continue.
p354
aVFirst, leadership.
p355
aVIn the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war
p356
aVare not natural
p357
aVbut man-made disasters,
p358
aVtheir prevention and settlement
p359
aVdoes not happen automatically either.
p360
aVLeadership needs to be capable,
p361
aVdetermined and visionary
p362
aVin its commitment to peace.
p363
aVLeaders need to connect to each other
p364
aVand to their followers,
p365
aVand they need to bring them along
p366
aVon what is an often arduous journey
p367
aVinto a peaceful future.
p368
aa(lp369
VSecond, diplomacy.
p370
aVDiplomacy needs to be well resourced,
p371
aVsustained,
p372
aVand apply the right mix of incentives and pressures
p373
aVon leaders and followers.
p374
aVIt needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,
p375
aVand it needs to ensure
p376
aVthat a broad coalition
p377
aVof local, regional
p378
aVand international supporters
p379
aVhelp them implement their agreement.
p380
aa(lp381
VThird, institutional design.
p382
aVInstitutional design requires
p383
aVa keen focus on issues,
p384
aVinnovative thinking
p385
aVand flexible and well-funded implementation.
p386
aVConflict parties need to move away
p387
aVfrom maximum demands
p388
aVand towards a compromise
p389
aVthat recognizes each other's needs.
p390
aVAnd they need to think
p391
aVabout the substance of their agreement
p392
aVmuch more than about
p393
aVthe labels they want to attach to them.
p394
aVConflict parties also need to be prepared
p395
aVto return to the negotiation table
p396
aVif the agreement implementation stalls.
p397
aa(lp398
VFor me personally,
p399
aVthe most critical lesson of all is this:
p400
aVLocal commitment to peace
p401
aVis all-important,
p402
aVbut it is often not enough
p403
aVto prevent or end violence.
p404
aVYet, no amount of diplomacy
p405
aVor institutional design
p406
aVcan make up for local failures
p407
aVand the consequences that they have.
p408
aVTherefore, we must invest
p409
aVin developing leaders,
p410
aVleaders that have the skills,
p411
aVvision and determination
p412
aVto make peace.
p413
aVLeaders, in other words,
p414
aVthat people will trust
p415
aVand that they will want to follow
p416
aVeven if that means
p417
aVmaking hard choices.
p418
aa(lp419
VA final thought:
p420
aVEnding civil wars
p421
aVis a process that is fraught with dangers,
p422
aVfrustrations and setbacks.
p423
aVIt often takes a generation to accomplish,
p424
aVbut it also requires us, today's generation,
p425
aVto take responsibility
p426
aVand to learn the right lessons
p427
aVabout leadership, diplomacy
p428
aVand institutional design,
p429
aVso that the child soldiers of today
p430
aVcan become the children of tomorrow.
