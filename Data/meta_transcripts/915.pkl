VWhen I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,
p4
aVthe future of the world was bleak.
p5
aVThe population explosion was unstoppable.
p6
aVGlobal famine was inevitable.
p7
aVA cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment
p8
aVwas going to shorten our lives.
p9
aVThe acid rain was falling on the forests.
p10
aVThe desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.
p11
aVThe oil was running out,
p12
aVand a nuclear winter would finish us off.
p13
aVNone of those things happened,
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVand astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,
p16
aVthe average per-capita income
p17
aVof the average person on the planet,
p18
aVin real terms, adjusted for inflation,
p19
aVhas tripled.
p20
aVLifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.
p21
aVChild mortality is down by two-thirds.
p22
aVPer-capita food production
p23
aVis up by a third.
p24
aVAnd all this at a time when the population has doubled.
p25
aa(lp26
VHow did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?
p27
aVHow did we achieve that?
p28
aVHow did we become
p29
aVthe only species
p30
aVthat becomes more prosperous
p31
aVas it becomes more populous?
p32
aVThe size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,
p33
aVand the level of the graph
p34
aVrepresents GDP per capita.
p35
aVI think to answer that question
p36
aVyou need to understand
p37
aVhow human beings bring together their brains
p38
aVand enable their ideas to combine and recombine,
p39
aVto meet and, indeed, to mate.
p40
aVIn other words, you need to understand
p41
aVhow ideas have sex.
p42
aa(lp43
VI want you to imagine
p44
aVhow we got from making objects like this
p45
aVto making objects like this.
p46
aVThese are both real objects.
p47
aVOne is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago
p48
aVof the kind made by Homo erectus.
p49
aVThe other is obviously a computer mouse.
p50
aVThey're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.
p51
aVI've tried to work out which is bigger,
p52
aVand it's almost impossible.
p53
aVAnd that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.
p54
aVThey're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.
p55
aVIt just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.
p56
aVThe differences are what interest me,
p57
aVbecause the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design
p58
aVfor about a million years \u2014
p59
aVfrom one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.
p60
aVHomo erectus made the same tool
p61
aVfor 30,000 generations.
p62
aVOf course there were a few changes,
p63
aVbut tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.
p64
aVThere was no progress, no innovation.
p65
aVIt's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.
p66
aVWhereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
p67
aVAnd there's another difference too,
p68
aVwhich is the object on the left is made from one substance.
p69
aVThe object on the right is made from
p70
aVa confection of different substances,
p71
aVfrom silicon and metal and plastic and so on.
p72
aVAnd more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,
p73
aVthe idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,
p74
aVthe idea of transistors.
p75
aVThey've all been combined together in this technology.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd it's this combination,
p78
aVthis cumulative technology, that intrigues me,
p79
aVbecause I think it's the secret to understanding
p80
aVwhat's happening in the world.
p81
aVMy body's an accumulation of ideas too:
p82
aVthe idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.
p83
aVThey've come together.
p84
aVHow does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
p85
aVWell, it uses sexual reproduction.
p86
aVIn an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,
p87
aVa green one and a red one,
p88
aVthen one has to be better than the other.
p89
aVOne goes extinct for the other to survive.
p90
aVBut if you have a sexual species,
p91
aVthen it's possible for an individual
p92
aVto inherit both mutations
p93
aVfrom different lineages.
p94
aVSo what sex does is it enables the individual
p95
aVto draw upon
p96
aVthe genetic innovations of the whole species.
p97
aVIt's not confined to its own lineage.
p98
aa(lp99
VWhat's the process that's having the same effect
p100
aVin cultural evolution
p101
aVas sex is having in biological evolution?
p102
aVAnd I think the answer is exchange,
p103
aVthe habit of exchanging one thing for another.
p104
aVIt's a unique human feature.
p105
aVNo other animal does it.
p106
aVYou can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange \u2014
p107
aVand indeed there's reciprocity in other animals \u2014
p108
aVBut the exchange of one object for another never happens.
p109
aVAs Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog
p110
aVmake a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVYou can have culture without exchange.
p113
aVYou can have, as it were, asexual culture.
p114
aVChimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.
p115
aVThey teach each other traditions
p116
aVwhich are handed down from parent to offspring.
p117
aVIn this case, chimpanzees teaching each other
p118
aVhow to crack nuts with rocks.
p119
aVBut the difference is
p120
aVthat these cultures never expand, never grow,
p121
aVnever accumulate, never become combinatorial,
p122
aVand the reason is because
p123
aVthere is no sex, as it were,
p124
aVthere is no exchange of ideas.
p125
aVChimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
p126
aVThere's no exchange of ideas between them.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd why does exchange raise living standards?
p129
aVWell, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
p130
aVAnd here is a Stone Age version of his story,
p131
aValthough he told it in terms of trade between countries.
p132
aVAdam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.
p133
aVOz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.
p134
aVSo Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.
p135
aVHe doesn't need Adam.
p136
aVHe can make his own spears and axes.
p137
aVWell no, because if you think about it,
p138
aVif Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,
p139
aVand then they trade,
p140
aVthen they will each have saved an hour of work.
p141
aVAnd the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,
p142
aVbecause the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes
p143
aVand the better Oz is going to get at making spears.
p144
aVSo the gains from trade are only going to grow.
p145
aVAnd this is one of the beauties of exchange,
p146
aVis it actually creates the momentum
p147
aVfor more specialization,
p148
aVwhich creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.
p149
aVAdam and Oz both saved an hour of time.
p150
aVThat is prosperity, the saving of time
p151
aVin satisfying your needs.
p152
aa(lp153
VAsk yourself how long you would have to work
p154
aVto provide for yourself
p155
aVan hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
p156
aVIf you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.
p157
aVYou find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
p158
aVYou render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.
p159
aVHow long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.
p160
aVHow long do you actually have to work
p161
aVto earn an hour of reading light
p162
aVif you're on the average wage in Britain today?
p163
aVAnd the answer is about half a second.
p164
aVBack in 1950,
p165
aVyou would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage
p166
aVto acquire that much light.
p167
aVAnd that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained
p168
aVsince 1950, as it were,
p169
aVbecause that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,
p170
aVor you can acquire another good or service.
p171
aVAnd back in 1880,
p172
aVit would have been 15 minutes
p173
aVto earn that amount of light on the average wage.
p174
aVBack in 1800,
p175
aVyou'd have had to work six hours
p176
aVto earn a candle that could burn for an hour.
p177
aVIn other words, the average person on the average wage
p178
aVcould not afford a candle in 1800.
p179
aa(lp180
VGo back to this image of the axe and the mouse,
p181
aVand ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"
p182
aVThe stone axe was made by someone for himself.
p183
aVIt was self-sufficiency.
p184
aVWe call that poverty these days.
p185
aVBut the object on the right
p186
aVwas made for me by other people.
p187
aVHow many other people?
p188
aVTens? Hundreds? Thousands?
p189
aVYou know, I think it's probably millions.
p190
aVBecause you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,
p191
aVwhich was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,
p192
aVwho was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.
p193
aVThey were all working for me,
p194
aVto make a mouse for me.
p195
aVAnd that's the way society works.
p196
aVThat's what we've achieved as a species.
p197
aa(lp198
VIn the old days, if you were rich,
p199
aVyou literally had people working for you.
p200
aVThat's how you got to be rich; you employed them.
p201
aVLouis XIV had a lot of people working for him.
p202
aVThey made his silly outfits, like this,
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVand they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.
p205
aVHe had 498 people
p206
aVto prepare his dinner every night.
p207
aVBut a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles
p208
aVand looking at Louis XIV's pictures,
p209
aVhe has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.
p210
aVThey're in bistros and cafes and restaurants
p211
aVand shops all over Paris,
p212
aVand they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal
p213
aVthat's probably got higher quality
p214
aVthan Louis XIV even had.
p215
aVAnd that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.
p216
aVWe're able to draw upon specialization and exchange
p217
aVto raise each other's living standards.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, you do get other animals working for each other too.
p220
aVAnts are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.
p221
aVBut there's a big difference,
p222
aVwhich is that it only happens within the colony.
p223
aVThere's no working for each other across the colonies.
p224
aVAnd the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.
p225
aVThat is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.
p226
aVThe queen does it all.
p227
aVIn our species, we don't like doing that.
p228
aVIt's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVEven in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VSo when did this habit start?
p235
aVAnd how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?
p236
aVWell, I think, probably, the oldest version of this
p237
aVis probably the sexual division of labor.
p238
aVBut I've got no evidence for that.
p239
aVIt just looks like the first thing we did
p240
aVwas work male for female and female for male.
p241
aVIn all hunter-gatherer societies today,
p242
aVthere's a foraging division of labor
p243
aVbetween, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.
p244
aVIt isn't always quite that simple,
p245
aVbut there's a distinction between
p246
aVspecialized roles for males and females.
p247
aVAnd the beauty of this system
p248
aVis that it benefits both sides.
p249
aVThe woman knows
p250
aVthat, in the Hadzas' case here \u2014
p251
aVdigging roots to share with men in exchange for meat \u2014
p252
aVshe knows that all she has to do to get access to protein
p253
aVis to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.
p254
aVAnd she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt
p255
aVand try and kill a warthog.
p256
aVAnd the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging
p257
aVto get roots.
p258
aVAll he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog
p259
aVit's big enough to share some.
p260
aVAnd so both sides raise each other's standards of living
p261
aVthrough the sexual division of labor.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhen did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible
p264
aVthat Neanderthals didn't do this.
p265
aVThey were a highly cooperative species.
p266
aVThey were a highly intelligent species.
p267
aVTheir brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine
p268
aVin this room today.
p269
aVThey were imaginative. They buried their dead.
p270
aVThey had language, probably,
p271
aVbecause we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,
p272
aVwhich was discovered here in Oxford.
p273
aVAnd so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.
p274
aVThey were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.
p275
aVBut there's no evidence
p276
aVof a sexual division of labor.
p277
aVThere's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.
p278
aVIt looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.
p279
aVAnd the other thing there's no evidence for
p280
aVis exchange between groups,
p281
aVbecause the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,
p282
aVthe tools they made,
p283
aVare always made from local materials.
p284
aVFor example, in the Caucasus
p285
aVthere's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.
p286
aVThey're always made from local chert.
p287
aVIn the same valley there are modern human remains
p288
aVfrom about the same date, 30,000 years ago,
p289
aVand some of those are from local chert,
p290
aVbut more \u2014 but many of them are made
p291
aVfrom obsidian from a long way away.
p292
aVAnd when human beings began
p293
aVmoving objects around like this,
p294
aVit was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.
p295
aa(lp296
VTrade is 10 times as old as farming.
p297
aVPeople forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.
p298
aVExchange between groups has been going on
p299
aVfor a hundred thousand years.
p300
aVAnd the earliest evidence for it crops up
p301
aVsomewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,
p302
aVwhen you see obsidian and jasper and other things
p303
aVmoving long distances in Ethiopia.
p304
aVYou also see seashells \u2014
p305
aVas discovered by a team here in Oxford \u2014
p306
aVmoving 125 miles inland
p307
aVfrom the Mediterranean in Algeria.
p308
aVAnd that's evidence that people
p309
aVhave started exchanging between groups.
p310
aVAnd that will have led to specialization.
p311
aa(lp312
VHow do you know that long-distance movement
p313
aVmeans trade rather than migration?
p314
aVWell, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,
p315
aVwho quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,
p316
aVwhich was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.
p317
aVThey traded them with their neighbors
p318
aVfor things like stingray barbs,
p319
aVand the consequence was that stone axes
p320
aVended up over a large part of Australia.
p321
aVSo long-distance movement of tools
p322
aVis a sign of trade, not migration.
p323
aa(lp324
VWhat happens when you cut people off from exchange,
p325
aVfrom the ability to exchange and specialize?
p326
aVAnd the answer is that
p327
aVnot only do you slow down technological progress,
p328
aVyou can actually throw it into reverse.
p329
aVAn example is Tasmania.
p330
aVWhen the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,
p331
aVthe people on it not only experienced
p332
aVslower progress than people on the mainland,
p333
aVthey actually experienced regress.
p334
aVThey gave up the ability to make stone tools
p335
aVand fishing equipment and clothing
p336
aVbecause the population of about 4,000 people
p337
aVwas simply not large enough
p338
aVto maintain the specialized skills
p339
aVnecessary to keep the technology they had.
p340
aVIt's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.
p341
aVHow many of the things in our pockets
p342
aVcould we continue to make after 10,000 years?
p343
aVIt didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego \u2014
p344
aVsimilar island, similar people.
p345
aVThe reason: because Tierra del Fuego
p346
aVis separated from South America by a much narrower straight,
p347
aVand there was trading contact across that straight
p348
aVthroughout 10,000 years.
p349
aVThe Tasmanians were isolated.
p350
aa(lp351
VGo back to this image again
p352
aVand ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,
p353
aVbut who knew how to make it.
p354
aVIn the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
p355
aVBut who knows how to make a computer mouse?
p356
aVNobody, literally nobody.
p357
aVThere is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.
p358
aVI mean this quite seriously.
p359
aVThe president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.
p360
aVHe just knows how to run a company.
p361
aVThe person on the assembly line doesn't know
p362
aVbecause he doesn't know how to drill an oil well
p363
aVto get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
p364
aVWe all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
p365
aa(lp366
VI am of course quoting from a famous essay
p367
aVby Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,
p368
aVcalled "I, Pencil"
p369
aVin which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,
p370
aVand how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,
p371
aVbecause the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,
p372
aVand they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.
p373
aVAnd what we've done in human society,
p374
aVthrough exchange and specialization,
p375
aVis we've created
p376
aVthe ability to do things that we don't even understand.
p377
aVIt's not the same with language.
p378
aVWith language we have to transfer ideas
p379
aVthat we understand with each other.
p380
aVBut with technology,
p381
aVwe can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.
p382
aa(lp383
VWe've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind
p384
aVto an extraordinary degree.
p385
aVAnd by the way,
p386
aVthat's one of the reasons that I'm not interested
p387
aVin the debate about I.Q.,
p388
aVabout whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.
p389
aVIt's completely irrelevant.
p390
aVWhat's relevant to a society
p391
aVis how well people are communicating their ideas,
p392
aVand how well they're cooperating,
p393
aVnot how clever the individuals are.
p394
aVSo we've created something called the collective brain.
p395
aVWe're just the nodes in the network.
p396
aVWe're the neurons in this brain.
p397
aVIt's the interchange of ideas,
p398
aVthe meeting and mating of ideas between them,
p399
aVthat is causing technological progress,
p400
aVincrementally, bit by bit.
p401
aVHowever, bad things happen.
p402
aVAnd in the future, as we go forward,
p403
aVwe will, of course, experience terrible things.
p404
aVThere will be wars; there will be depressions;
p405
aVthere will be natural disasters.
p406
aVAwful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.
p407
aVBut I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,
p408
aVand the ability of ideas
p409
aVto meet and to mate
p410
aVas never before,
p411
aVI'm also sure
p412
aVthat technology will advance,
p413
aVand therefore living standards will advance.
p414
aVBecause through the cloud,
p415
aVthrough crowd sourcing,
p416
aVthrough the bottom-up world that we've created,
p417
aVwhere not just the elites but everybody
p418
aVis able to have their ideas
p419
aVand make them meet and mate,
p420
aVwe are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.
