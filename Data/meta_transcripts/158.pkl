VI\u2019d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa \u2014
p4
aVthose women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
p5
aVAnd, of course, I\u2019m dedicating it also to my grandmother,
p6
aVwhom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,
p7
aVespecially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.

aa(lp9
VYou will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted
p10
aVthe language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,
p11
aVas they were sort of like really told
p12
aVthat they must do everything in Afrikaans \u2014
p13
aVbiology, mathematics \u2014 and what about our languages?
p14
aVAnd the students wanted to speak to the government,
p15
aVand police answered with bullets.
p16
aVSo every year, June 16, we will commemorate
p17
aVall those comrades or students who died.
p18
aVAnd I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,
p19
aVand I started asking questions,
p20
aVand that\u2019s when my political education started.
p21
aVAnd I joined, later on, the youth organization
p22
aVunder the African National Congress.
p23
aVSo as part of organizing this and whatever,
p24
aVthis commemoration, the police will round us up
p25
aVas they call us leaders.
p26
aVAnd I used to run away from home,
p27
aVwhen I know that maybe the police might be coming
p28
aVaround the ninth or 10th of June or so.
p29
aVAnd my grandmother one time said,
p30
aV"No, look, you\u2019re not going to run away.
p31
aVThis is your place, you stay here."
p32
aVAnd indeed, the police came \u2014 because they\u2019ll just arrest us
p33
aVand put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,
p36
aVand my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,
p37
aVand opened the kitchen door.
p38
aVAnd she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.
p39
aVI'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,
p40
aVwhile your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.
p41
aVHe is here, and you're not going to take him.
p42
aVI've got a bowl full of boiling water \u2014 the first one who comes in here, gets it."
p43
aVAnd they left.

p68
aV\u266b Sister, why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer? \u266b
