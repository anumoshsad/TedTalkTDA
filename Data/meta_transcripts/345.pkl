V[SHIT]
p4
aa(lp5
VThis is arguably the back end of the design of animals.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBut the reason I put this up here is because
p10
aVwhen I was in Africa last year, my wife and I were driving around,
p11
aVwe had this wonderful guide,
p12
aVwho showed us something that surprised both of us,
p13
aVand it was very revealing in terms of the fascination
p14
aVthat comes with the design of animals.
p15
aVIt turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa
p16
aVto spread the word of Christianity,
p17
aVto teach English to the natives.
p18
aVAnd they brought blackboards and chalk.
p19
aVAnd I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard,
p20
aVand I just used some chalk on there.
p21
aVAnd they brought quite a bit of this stuff.
p22
aVBut over the years, the blackboards were fine,
p23
aVbut they ran out of chalk.
p24
aVAnd this is a real crisis for them.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd that's where the hyena comes in.
p27
aVThe hyena is probably the most perfectly designed
p28
aVscavenging animal in the world.
p29
aVIt strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth,
p30
aVbecause it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.
p31
aVNow, the end product of that action is up on the board here.
p32
aVWhat the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around
p33
aVand they'd pick up hyena shit.
p34
aVAnd the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThat's not what I'm here to talk about,
p39
aVbut it is a fascinating aspect of animal design.
p40
aVWhat I'm here to talk about is the camel.
p41
aVWhen I started talking to Richard
p42
aVabout what I was going to speak about,
p43
aVI had recently come back from Jordan,
p44
aVwhere I had an amazing experience with a camel.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd we were in the desert.
p49
aa(lp50
VRichard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.
p53
aVThere were four of us, two Bedouin drivers.
p54
aVYou can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand,
p55
aV105 degrees, one water bottle.
p56
aVAnd we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep.
p57
aVDidn't look like it to me.
p58
aVAnd as we started to go through the desert,
p59
aVthe Jeep broke down.
p60
aVThe guys got out, they put the hood up,
p61
aVthey started working under the hood, got it going again.
p62
aVAbout a hundred yards, it broke down.
p63
aVThis went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed,
p64
aVwe were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd eventually, our worst nightmare happened:
p67
aVthey flooded the engine.
p68
aVAnd they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."
p69
aVAnd we said, "We get out and walk?"
p70
aVOne water bottle, remember, guys, four people.
p71
aVAnd they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels."
p72
aVWe got out and walked, and sure enough,
p73
aVabout half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill,
p74
aVand there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels.
p75
aVThe guy went up and started dickering,
p76
aVand 10 dollars later, we had four camels.
p77
aVThey went down like elevators; we got on them.
p78
aVThey went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them,
p79
aVgot behind each of the camels with a little whip.
p80
aVAnd they started slashing away at the back of the camels,
p81
aVand they started galloping.
p82
aVAnd if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.
p83
aVThere's also one other aspect about these camels.
p84
aVAbout every 10 steps, they lean back
p85
aVand try to take a chunk out of your leg.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VSo we kept on going,
p90
aVand this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg.
p91
aVAnd eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination,
p92
aVwhere a Jeep was supposed to meet us.
p93
aVAnd the camels come down again like elevators,
p94
aVwe sort of clumsily get off,
p95
aVand they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg.
p96
aVAnd I've developed a very wonderful relationship
p97
aVwith this creature by this point,
p98
aVand I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.
p99
aVAnd much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me
p100
aVand tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters
p101
aVto take back to the States.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo as we talked, Richard and I,
p104
aVI said, "You know, maybe I should bring a camel.
p105
aVIt's the best designed animal in the world."
p106
aVHe went, "Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel."
p107
aVAnd you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.
p108
aVSo I did the next best thing.
p109
aVI went to the Washington Zoo.
p110
aVRichard said, "I want you to get up close and personal with this camel.
p111
aVI want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.
p112
aVGo underneath it. Go above it. Go around it.
p113
aVPull its tail up; take a look in there.
p114
aVI want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can."
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, I got a National Geographic film crew.
p117
aVWe went down there, and I took one look at this camel.
p118
aVIt is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut,
p123
aVit is a scary, scary thing to behold.
p124
aVAnd if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel,
p125
aVsomeone was smoking Bedouin high grade.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VSo we got as close to it as possible,
p130
aVand I'm going to share this.
p131
aVChris, if you want to roll this film.
p132
aVThen I'm going to show you
p133
aVa little bit more about the design of camels.
p134
aa(lp135
VDo you want to roll the film?
p136
aa(lp137
V(Adventure music)
p138
aa(lp139
V(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows
p140
aVwith the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit.
p141
aVI'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Music continues)
p144
aa(lp145
VKeith Bellows: And you'll note I started chewing gum
p146
aVbecause I was around this camel all day.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Video) That's it, OK. No!
p149
aVSee, now he's getting a little overexcited.
p150
aVSo we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you.
p151
aVNow, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there.
p152
aVI always called myself the unstable stable boy.
p153
aVTheir nose, you can see his nose is flared right now.
p154
aVWhen they're in rut, they're similar to seals
p155
aVin the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe.
p156
aVAnd they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.
p157
aa(lp158
VKB: Ears?
p159
aa(lp160
VSK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing.
p161
aVBut not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear
p162
aVthat's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around.
p163
aVAnd they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision.
p164
aVThey use that to pinpoint sound.
p165
aVThe desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold.
p166
aVSo not only do they have the very long eyelashes,
p167
aVbut there's the secondary \u2014
p168
aVI guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever.
p169
aVIt's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.
p170
aa(lp171
VMost people think that the humps store water.
p172
aVThey don't. They store fat.
p173
aVNow, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens
p174
aVis the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
p175
aVAnd that will turn it into actually usable water.
p176
aVLike a lot of predators, they walk on their toes.
p177
aVBut there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out.
p178
aVThey're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand.
p179
aVHooves? They don't have traditional hooves,
p180
aVbut they do have one, like, big nail.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Audience laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VYou can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over.
p185
aVBut they use their tails a lot, especially in rut.
p186
aVHe will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around
p187
aVand make him more attractive.
p188
aVI don't know why that would be, but it works for them.
p189
aVSo, what the hell.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Audience laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, they will also defecate in certain areas.
p194
aVGenerally, they poop wherever they want to,
p195
aVbut during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas.
p196
aVI don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,
p197
aVyou know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"
p198
aVThese big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing.
p199
aVYou can actually see, right here, it will vibrate.
p200
aVWe weigh our animals.
p201
aVUnfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal,
p202
aVso he's actually destroyed some of the scales.
p203
aVWe had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance.
p204
aVI'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds.
p205
aVBut I would put him closer to 2,000.
p206
aVHe's basically a walking mulch pile.
p207
aVWe're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.
p208
aa(lp209
VKB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.
p210
aVAnd it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.
p211
aVDon't even think about it. Don't think about it!
p212
aa(lp213
VBut now, we're going to meet. Out!
p214
aVOut! Out!
p215
aVNo.
p216
aVOut!
p217
aa(lp218
V(Music)
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VKB: What I didn't show you was, you got that swinging thing going?
p223
aVWell, and you're glad I didn't show you this.
p224
aVOne of the other things about the camel's beautiful design
p225
aVis that its penis points backwards.
p226
aVThat way the camel can dip its tail in the stream,
p227
aVand just whacker the entire area around him.
p228
aVAnd that's how he really marks his territory.
p229
aVNow, what you also didn't see was that \u2014
p230
aVand you may have noticed in the pen beside him
p231
aVand, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.
p232
aVIn the pen beside him is Jasmine.
p233
aVJasmine has been his mate for some time.
p234
aVBut on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear
p235
aVthat as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it.
p236
aVAnd so we started thinking.
p237
aVWell, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate,
p238
aVwhat would Suki do to find the perfect mate?
p239
aa(lp240
VI'm going to show you another film.
p241
aVBut before I do, I just want to mention
p242
aVthat this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand,
p243
aVthe ship of the desert.
p244
aVIt's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas
p245
aVin which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara,
p246
aVthat there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
p247
aVAnd if this is a creature that was designed by committee,
p248
aVit's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on.
p249
aVSo here's what Suki would do in search of a mate.
p250
aVCan you roll it, please?
p251
aa(lp252
VCamel seeking camel
p253
aVLusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate.
p254
aVI'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs \u2014
p255
aVand I'm very well ... hung.
p256
aVI'm TED Camel.
p257
aVThe perfect desert machine.
p258
aVI'm smartly designed.
p259
aVEyelashes that keep out sand
p260
aVand a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper.
p261
aVA distinguished nose \u2014
p262
aVwith nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust
p263
aVand a groove that catches moisture.
p264
aVAmazingly full lips \u2014
p265
aVthat allow me to eat practically anything that grows.
p266
aVCallouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably.
p267
aVLeathery chest pads that beat the heat.
p268
aVShort fur that keeps my skin cool.
p269
aVLong legs that allow heat to escape.
p270
aVAnd my hump?
p271
aVOgden Nash once wrote:
p272
aV"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two,
p273
aVor else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?"
p274
aVHere's a hint:
p275
aVBactarian.
p276
aVDromedary.
p277
aVMy hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O.
p278
aVI'm built to last.
p279
aVI'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry.
p280
aVI usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF,
p281
aVenough to fry an egg.
p282
aVI'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying.
p283
aV(Most animals would if they lost half that much.)
p284
aVI'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day.
p285
aVBut go without for more than a month.
p286
aVI'm powerful.
p287
aVAble to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.
p288
aVOutrun a horse \u2014
p289
aVAnd cover 26 miles on a good day.
p290
aVCamelot.
p291
aVJackie O. once said that traveling by camel
p292
aVmade riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane.
p293
aVYet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand.
p294
aV(Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?)
p295
aVI'm a good provider, too.
p296
aVBedouins call the camel the Gift of God.
p297
aVNo surprise.
p298
aVTents and rugs are made of my hair.
p299
aVMy dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory.
p300
aVMy dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.
p301
aV"Camels are like angels," a Bedouin once said.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VThank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought,
p306
aVwhich is probably the most important thing to take away.
p307
aVHumans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large,
p308
aVwe really don't have to adapt to our environment;
p309
aVwe adapt our environment to us.
p310
aVAnd we've seen that repeatedly through this conference,
p311
aVnot just this year, but in past years.
p312
aVBut this creature that you've just seen
p313
aVultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting.
p314
aVI think when you look at the animal kingdom,
p315
aVthat is one of the most remarkable things.
p316
aVIt doesn't have an environment that adapts to it;
p317
aVit has to adapt to the environment.
p318
aa(lp319
VRicky, thank you very much for having me.
p320
aa(lp321
