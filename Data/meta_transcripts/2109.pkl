VAlmost a year ago,
p4
aVmy aunt started suffering back pains.
p5
aVShe went to see the doctor
p6
aVand they told her it was a normal injury
p7
aVfor someone who had been playing tennis
p8
aVfor almost 30 years.
p9
aVThey recommended that she do some therapy,
p10
aVbut after a while she wasn't feeling better,
p11
aVso the doctors decided to do further tests.
p12
aVThey did an x-ray
p13
aVand discovered an injury in her lungs,
p14
aVand at the time they thought that the injury
p15
aVwas a strain in the muscles and tendons
p16
aVbetween her ribs,
p17
aVbut after a few weeks of treatment,
p18
aVagain her health wasn't getting any better.
p19
aVSo finally, they decided to do a biopsy,
p20
aVand two weeks later,
p21
aVthe results of the biopsy came back.
p22
aVIt was stage 3 lung cancer.
p23
aa(lp24
VHer lifestyle was almost free of risk.
p25
aVShe never smoked a cigarette,
p26
aVshe never drank alcohol,
p27
aVand she had been playing sports
p28
aVfor almost half her life.
p29
aVPerhaps, that is why it took them almost six months
p30
aVto get her properly diagnosed.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy story might be, unfortunately,
p33
aVfamiliar to most of you.
p34
aVOne out of three people sitting in this audience
p35
aVwill be diagnosed with some type of cancer,
p36
aVand one out of four
p37
aVwill die because of it.
p38
aVNot only did that cancer diagnosis
p39
aVchange the life of our family,
p40
aVbut that process of going
p41
aVback and forth with new tests,
p42
aVdifferent doctors describing symptoms,
p43
aVdiscarding diseases over and over,
p44
aVwas stressful and frustrating,
p45
aVespecially for my aunt.
p46
aVAnd that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done
p47
aVsince the beginning of history.
p48
aVWe have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs
p49
aVto treat cancer,
p50
aVbut we still have 20th-century procedures
p51
aVand processes for diagnosis, if any.
p52
aa(lp53
VToday, most of us have to wait for symptoms
p54
aVto indicate that something is wrong.
p55
aVToday, the majority of people still don't have access
p56
aVto early cancer detection methods,
p57
aVeven though we know
p58
aVthat catching cancer early
p59
aVis basically the closest thing we have
p60
aVto a silver bullet cure against it.
p61
aVWe know that we can change this in our lifetime,
p62
aVand that is why my team and I
p63
aVhave decided to begin this journey,
p64
aVthis journey to try to make cancer detection
p65
aVat the early stages
p66
aVand monitoring the appropriate  response at the molecular level
p67
aVeasier, cheaper, smarter
p68
aVand more accessible than ever before.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe context, of course,
p71
aVis that we're living at a time
p72
aVwhere technology is disrupting our present
p73
aVat exponential rates,
p74
aVand the biological realm is no exception.
p75
aVIt is said today that biotech is advancing
p76
aVat least six times faster than the growth rate
p77
aVof the processing power of computers.
p78
aVBut progress in biotech
p79
aVis not only being accelerated,
p80
aVit is also being democratized.
p81
aVJust as personal computers or the Internet
p82
aVor smartphones leveled the playing field
p83
aVfor entrepreneurship, politics or education,
p84
aVrecent advances have leveled it up for biotech progress as well,
p85
aVand that is allowing
p86
aVmultidisciplinary teams like ours
p87
aVto try to tackle and look at these problems
p88
aVwith new approaches.
p89
aa(lp90
VWe are a team of scientists and technologists
p91
aVfrom Chile, Panama,
p92
aVMexico, Israel and Greece,
p93
aVand based on recent scientific discoveries,
p94
aVwe believe that we have found
p95
aVa reliable and accurate way
p96
aVof detecting several types of cancer
p97
aVat the very early stages through a blood sample.
p98
aVWe do it by detecting a set of very small molecules
p99
aVthat circulate freely in our blood
p100
aVcalled microRNAs.
p101
aa(lp102
VTo explain what microRNAs are
p103
aVand their important role in cancer,
p104
aVI need to start with proteins,
p105
aVbecause when cancer is present in our body,
p106
aVprotein modification is observed
p107
aVin all cancerous cells.
p108
aVAs you might know,
p109
aVproteins are large biological molecules
p110
aVthat perform different functions within our body,
p111
aVlike catalyzing metabolic reactions
p112
aVor responding to stimuli
p113
aVor replicating DNA,
p114
aVbut before a protein is expressed or produced,
p115
aVrelevant parts of its genetic code
p116
aVpresent in the DNA
p117
aVare copied into the messenger RNA,
p118
aVso this messenger RNA
p119
aVhas instructions on how to build a specific protein,
p120
aVand potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,
p121
aVbut the one that tells them when to build them
p122
aVand how many to build
p123
aVare microRNAs.
p124
aVSo microRNAs are small molecules
p125
aVthat regulate gene expression.
p126
aVUnlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,
p127
aVmicroRNAs can vary depending on internal
p128
aVand environmental conditions at any given time,
p129
aVtelling us which genes are actively  expressed at that particular moment.
p130
aVAnd that is what makes microRNAs
p131
aVsuch a promising biomarker for cancer,
p132
aVbecause as you know,
p133
aVcancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
p134
aVIt is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.
p135
aVAnother important thing to consider
p136
aVis that no two cancers are the same,
p137
aVbut at the microRNA level, there are patterns.
p138
aVSeveral scientific studies have shown
p139
aVthat abnormal microRNA expression levels
p140
aVvaries and creates a unique, specific pattern
p141
aVfor each type of cancer,
p142
aVeven at the early stages,
p143
aVreflecting the progression of the disease,
p144
aVand whether it's responding to medication
p145
aVor in remission,
p146
aVmaking microRNAs a perfect,
p147
aVhighly sensitive biomarker.
p148
aa(lp149
VHowever, the problem with microRNAs
p150
aVis that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology
p151
aVto detect them in a reliable way,
p152
aVbecause they are very short sequences of nucleotides,
p153
aVmuch smaller than DNA.
p154
aVAnd also, all microRNAs are very similar to each other,
p155
aVwith just tiny differences.
p156
aVSo imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,
p157
aVextremely similar, extremely small.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe believe that we have found a way to do so,
p160
aVand this is the first time that we've shown it in public.
p161
aVLet me do a demonstration.
p162
aVImagine that next time you go to your doctor
p163
aVand do your next standard blood test,
p164
aVa lab technician extracts a total RNA,
p165
aVwhich is quite simple today,
p166
aVand puts it in a standard  96-well plate like this one.
p167
aVEach well of these plates
p168
aVhas specific biochemistry that we assign,
p169
aVthat is looking for a specific microRNA,
p170
aVacting like a trap that closes
p171
aVonly when the microRNA is present in the sample,
p172
aVand when it does, it will shine with green color.
p173
aVTo run the reaction,
p174
aVyou put the plate inside a device like this one,
p175
aVand then you can put your smartphone on top of it.
p176
aVIf we can have a camera here
p177
aVso you can see my screen.
p178
aVA smartphone is a connected computer
p179
aVand it's also a camera,
p180
aVgood enough for our purpose.
p181
aVThe smartphone is taking pictures,
p182
aVand when the reaction is over,
p183
aVit will send the pictures
p184
aVto our online database for processing
p185
aVand interpretation.
p186
aVThis entire process lasts around 60 minutes,
p187
aVbut when the process is over,
p188
aVwells that shine are matched  with the specific microRNAs
p189
aVand analyzed in terms of how much and how fast
p190
aVthey shine.
p191
aVAnd then, when this entire process is over,
p192
aVthis is what happens.
p193
aVThis chart is showing the specific microRNAs
p194
aVpresent in this sample
p195
aVand how they reacted over time.
p196
aVThen, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA
p197
aVof this person's samples
p198
aVand compare it with existing scientific documentation
p199
aVthat correlates microRNA patterns
p200
aVwith a specific presence of a disease,
p201
aVthis is how pancreatic cancer looks like.
p202
aVThis inside is a real sample
p203
aVwhere we just detected pancreatic cancer.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Applause)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnother important aspect of this approach
p208
aVis the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,
p209
aVso we can get results in real time
p210
aVand analyze them with our contextual information.
p211
aVIf we want to better understand
p212
aVand decode diseases like cancer,
p213
aVwe need to stop treating them
p214
aVas acute, isolated episodes,
p215
aVand consider and measure everything
p216
aVthat affects our health on a permanent basis.
p217
aVThis entire platform is a working prototype.
p218
aVIt uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,
p219
aVa low-cost, 3D-printed device,
p220
aVand data science
p221
aVto try to tackle one of humanity's  toughest challenges.
p222
aVSince we believe early cancer detection
p223
aVshould really be democratized,
p224
aVthis entire solution costs at least 50 times less
p225
aVthan current available methods,
p226
aVand we know that the community can help us
p227
aVaccelerate this even more,
p228
aVso we're making the design of the device
p229
aVopen-source.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Applause)
p232
aa(lp233
VLet me say very clearly
p234
aVthat we are at the very early stages,
p235
aVbut so far, we have been able
p236
aVto successfully identify the microRNA pattern
p237
aVof pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,
p238
aVbreast cancer and hepatic cancer.
p239
aVAnd currently, we're doing a clinical trial
p240
aVin collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center
p241
aVwith 200 women for breast cancer.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aVThis is the single non-invasive,
p245
aVaccurate and affordable test
p246
aVthat has the potential to dramatically change
p247
aVhow cancer procedures and diagnostics
p248
aVhave been done.
p249
aVSince we're looking for the microRNA patterns
p250
aVin your blood at any given time,
p251
aVyou don't need to know which cancer you're looking for.
p252
aVYou don't need to have any symptoms.
p253
aVYou only need one milliliter of blood
p254
aVand a relatively simple array of tools.
p255
aa(lp256
VToday, cancer detection happens mainly
p257
aVwhen symptoms appear.
p258
aVThat is, at stage 3 or 4,
p259
aVand I believe that is too late.
p260
aVIt is too expensive for our families.
p261
aVIt is too expensive for humanity.
p262
aVWe cannot lose the war against cancer.
p263
aVIt not only costs us billions of dollars,
p264
aVbut it also costs us the people we love.
p265
aVToday, my aunt, she's fighting bravely
p266
aVand going through this process with a very positive attitude.
p267
aVHowever, I want fights like this
p268
aVto become very rare.
p269
aVI want to see the day
p270
aVwhen cancer is treated easily
p271
aVbecause it can be routinely diagnosed
p272
aVat the very early stages,
p273
aVand I'm certain
p274
aVthat in the very near future,
p275
aVbecause of this
p276
aVand other breakthroughs that we are seeing
p277
aVevery day in the life sciences,
p278
aVthe way we see cancer
p279
aVwill radically change.
p280
aVIt will give us the chance of detecting it early,
p281
aVunderstanding it better,
p282
aVand finding a cure.
