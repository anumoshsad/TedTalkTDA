(lp3
VSomeone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."
p4
aVSo, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.
p5
aVThe other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,
p6
aVto give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,
p7
aVwhere the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.
p8
aa(lp9
VThere was even a story recently that scientists had thought about
p10
aVactually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
p11
aVAnd someone asked,"Why?"
p12
aVand they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,
p13
aVno one really minds what happens to them
p14
aVand, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.
p18
aVThis, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind
p19
aVin British politics or American politics,
p20
aVand that is: We have run out of money.
p21
aVWe have vast budget deficits.
p22
aVThis is my global public debt clock,
p23
aVand, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I think what this leads to
p26
aVis a very simple recognition,
p27
aVthat there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,
p28
aVand it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?
p29
aVBecause there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,
p30
aVor to improve government, or to improve so many of the things
p31
aVthat politicians talk about.
p32
aVSo what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money \u2014
p33
aVyou can only measure success in public services
p34
aVin health care and education and policing by spending more money,
p35
aVyou can only measure progress by spending money \u2014
p36
aVyou're going to have a pretty miserable time.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being \u2014
p39
aVthings like your family relationships, friendship, community, values \u2014
p40
aVthen, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.
p41
aVAnd the really simple argument I want to make tonight,
p42
aVthe really straightforward argument is this:
p43
aVThat if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,
p44
aVwith the incredible information revolution that has taken place,
p45
aVand that all of you know so much more about than I do,
p46
aVI think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,
p47
aVremake government, remake public services,
p48
aVand achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.
p49
aVThat's the argument I want to make tonight.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, starting with the political philosophy.
p52
aVNow I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.
p53
aVOf course we don't.
p54
aVBut there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy
p55
aVthat are really relevant to this whole debate.
p56
aVThe first is this: We believe that if you give people
p57
aVmore power and control over their lives,
p58
aVif you give people more choice,
p59
aVif you put them in the driving seat,
p60
aVthen actually, you can create a stronger and better society.
p61
aVAnd if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance
p62
aVof information that we have in our world today,
p63
aVI think you can completely, as I've said,
p64
aVremake politics, remake government, remake your public services.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.
p67
aVPolitics and politicians will only succeed
p68
aVif they actually try and treat with people as they are,
p69
aVrather than as they would like them to be.
p70
aVNow, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought \u2014
p71
aVgo with the grain of human nature \u2014
p72
aVwith all the advances in behavioral economics,
p73
aVsome of which we were just hearing about,
p74
aVagain, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,
p75
aVin happiness, in a stronger society
p76
aVwithout necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?
p79
aVWell, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson
p80
aVabout what I would say are the three passages of history:
p81
aVthe pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age
p82
aVand what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.
p83
aVA simpler way of thinking of it
p84
aVis that we have gone from a world of local control,
p85
aVthen we went to a world of central control,
p86
aVand now we're in a world of people control.
p87
aVLocal power, central power, now, people power.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.
p90
aVThought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.
p91
aVCouldn't actually turn back very much,
p92
aVbecause if you were king a thousand years ago,
p93
aVwhile it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,
p94
aVthere wasn't much you were in charge of.
p95
aVYou weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.
p96
aVYou could just about go to war and that was about it.
p97
aVThis was the pre-bureaucratic age,
p98
aVan age in which everything had to be local.
p99
aVYou had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information
p100
aVbecause travel was so restricted.
p101
aVSo this was the pre-bureaucratic age.
p102
aa(lp103
VNext part of the cold history lesson,
p104
aVthe lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.
p105
aVSuddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,
p106
aVand this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.
p107
aVAnd hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.
p108
aVSuddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.
p109
aVIt was able \u2014 but only it was able \u2014 to organize
p110
aVhealth care, education, policing, justice.
p111
aVAnd it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.
p112
aVIt had sucked all that power up from the localities.
p113
aVIt was able to do that itself.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:
p116
aVthe massive information revolution.
p117
aVJust consider this one fact:
p118
aVOne hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.
p119
aVRight now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,
p120
aVand all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,
p121
aVand we can send and receive huge quantities of information
p122
aVwithout it costing anything.
p123
aVSo we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,
p124
aVwhere genuine people power is possible.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, what does this mean for our politics,
p127
aVfor our public services, for our government?
p128
aVWell I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,
p129
aVbut let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.
p130
aVAnd this is so obvious, in a way, because
p131
aVyou think about how all of you have changed
p132
aVthe way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
p133
aVThat is already happened; the information and Internet revolution
p134
aVhas actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,
p135
aVbut it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, how could this happen?
p138
aVWell, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:
p139
aVin transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,
p140
aVin giving us that genuine people power.
p141
aVIf we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,
p142
aVthe Missouri Accountability Portal.
p143
aVIn the old days, only the government could hold the information,
p144
aVand only a few elected people could try and grab that information
p145
aVand question it and challenge it.
p146
aVNow here, on one website, one state in America,
p147
aVevery single dollar spent by that government
p148
aVis searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.
p149
aa(lp150
VThink of the huge change that means:
p151
aVAny business that wants to bid for a government contract
p152
aVcan see what currently is being spent.
p153
aVAnyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"
p154
aVit's all available there.
p155
aVWe have only, in government and in politics,
p156
aVstarted to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world
p157
aVwith the information revolution.
p158
aVSo, complete transparency will make a huge difference.
p159
aVIn this country, if we win the election,
p160
aVwe are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds
p161
aVtransparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.
p162
aVWe're going to make every contract \u2014 we're announcing this today \u2014
p163
aVavailable on the Internet so anyone can see
p164
aVwhat the terms are, what the conditions are,
p165
aVdriving huge value for money,
p166
aVbut also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.
p167
aa(lp168
VChoice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,
p169
aVand yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface
p170
aVof public services like education, or health care or policing,
p171
aVand you're going to see this change massively.
p172
aVWe should be making this change
p173
aVwith the information revolution in our country,
p174
aVwith searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,
p175
aVwhat records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,
p176
aVwho does best at infection control \u2014
p177
aVall of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health
p178
aVis now available for all of us to see.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd the third of these big changes: accountability.
p181
aVThis, I think, is a huge change.
p182
aVIt is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.
p183
aVSo, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information
p184
aVabout which crimes are committed where,
p185
aVand we have to employ people in government
p186
aVto try and hold the police to account,
p187
aVsuddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,
p188
aVwhere we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed \u2014
p189
aVwhere, when and by whom \u2014
p190
aVand we can hold the police to account.
p191
aVAnd you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,
p192
aVbut actually that's an assault, the one in blue.
p193
aVYou can see what crime is committed where,
p194
aVand you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.
p195
aVSo those three ways \u2014 transparency, accountability and choice \u2014
p196
aVwill make a huge difference.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow I also said the other principle
p199
aVthat I think we should work on is understanding of people,
p200
aVis recognizing that going with the grain of human nature
p201
aVyou can achieve so much more.
p202
aVNow, we're got a huge revolution in understanding
p203
aVof why people behave in the way that they do,
p204
aVand a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.
p205
aVWe're working with some of these people.
p206
aVWe're being advised by some of these people, as was said,
p207
aVto try and bring all the experience to book.
p208
aa(lp209
VLet me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.
p210
aVWe want to get people to be more energy efficient.
p211
aVWhy? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,
p212
aVand it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.
p213
aVHow do you do it?
p214
aVWell, we've had government information campaigns over the years
p215
aVwhen they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.
p216
aVWe even had \u2014 one government minister once told us to
p217
aVbrush our teeth in the dark.
p218
aVI don't think they lasted very long.
p219
aVLook at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.
p220
aVThe best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill
p221
aVis to show them their own spending,
p222
aVto show them what their neighbors are spending,
p223
aVand then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.
p224
aVThat sort of behavioral economics
p225
aVcan transform people's behavior
p226
aVin a way that all the bullying and all the information
p227
aVand all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.
p228
aVOther examples are recycling.
p229
aVWe all know we need to recycle more.
p230
aVHow do we make it happen?
p231
aVAll the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,
p232
aVif you give them a carrot rather than a stick,
p233
aVyou can transform their behavior.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo what does all this add up to?
p236
aVHere are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.
p237
aVObviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple
p238
aVand powerful formulation,
p239
aV"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"
p240
aVan incredibly noble sentiment.
p241
aVBut when he made that speech, what could you do
p242
aVto build the stronger, better society?
p243
aVYou could fight for your country, you could die for your country,
p244
aVyou could serve in your country's civil service,
p245
aVbut you didn't really have the information and the knowledge
p246
aVand the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd I think an even more wonderful speech,
p249
aVwhich I'm going to read a big chunk of,
p250
aVwhich sums up what I said at the beginning
p251
aVabout believing there is more to life than money,
p252
aVand more that we should try and measure than money.
p253
aVAnd it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description
p254
aVof why gross national product captures so little:
p255
aVIt "does not allow for the health of our children,
p256
aVthe quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
p257
aVIt does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,
p258
aVthe intelligence of our public debate.
p259
aVIt measures neither our wit nor our courage,
p260
aVneither our wisdom nor our learning,
p261
aVneither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
p262
aVIt measures everything, in short,
p263
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile."
p264
aa(lp265
VAgain, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,
p266
aVand a beautiful dream 40 years ago,
p267
aVbut now with the huge advances in information technology,
p268
aVwith the massive changes in behavioral economics,
p269
aVwith all that we know about how you advance well-being,
p270
aVthat if we combine those insights
p271
aVof giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,
p272
aVand using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,
p273
aVwhile at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,
p274
aVit is a dream more easy to realize today
p275
aVthan it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.
p276
