VI could never have imagined
p4
aVthat a 19-year-old suicide bomber
p5
aVwould actually teach me a valuable lesson.
p6
aVBut he did.
p7
aVHe taught me to never presume anything
p8
aVabout anyone you don't know.
p9
aa(lp10
VOn a Thursday morning in July 2005,
p11
aVthe bomber and I, unknowingly,
p12
aVboarded the same train carriage at the same time,
p13
aVstanding, apparently, just feet apart.
p14
aVI didn't see him.
p15
aVActually, I didn't see anyone.
p16
aVYou know not to look at anyone on the Tube,
p17
aVbut I guess he saw me.
p18
aVI guess he looked at all of us,
p19
aVas his hand hovered over the detonation switch.
p20
aVI've often wondered: What was he thinking?
p21
aVEspecially in those final seconds.
p22
aa(lp23
VI know it wasn't personal.
p24
aVHe didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks.
p25
aVI mean \u2014 he didn't know me.
p26
aVNo.
p27
aVInstead, he gave me
p28
aVan unwarranted and an unwanted label.
p29
aVI had become the enemy.
p30
aVTo him, I was the "other,"
p31
aVthe "them," as opposed to "us."
p32
aVThe label "enemy" allowed him to dehumanize us.
p33
aVIt allowed him to push that button.
p34
aVAnd he wasn't selective.
p35
aVTwenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone,
p36
aVand I was almost one of them.
p37
aa(lp38
VIn the time it takes to draw a breath,
p39
aVwe were plunged into a darkness so immense
p40
aVthat it was almost tangible;
p41
aVwhat I imagine wading through tar might be like.
p42
aVWe didn't know we were the enemy.
p43
aVWe were just a bunch of commuters who, minutes earlier,
p44
aVhad followed the Tube etiquette:
p45
aVno direct eye contact,
p46
aVno talking
p47
aVand absolutely no conversation.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut in the lifting of the darkness,
p50
aVwe were reaching out.
p51
aVWe were helping each other.
p52
aVWe were calling out our names,
p53
aVa little bit like a roll call,
p54
aVwaiting for responses.
p55
aa(lp56
V"I'm Gill. I'm here.
p57
aVI'm alive.
p58
aVOK."
p59
aa(lp60
V"I'm Gill.
p61
aVHere.
p62
aVAlive.
p63
aVOK."
p64
aa(lp65
VI didn't know Alison.
p66
aVBut I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.
p67
aVI didn't know Richard.
p68
aVBut it mattered to me that he survived.
p69
aa(lp70
VAll I shared with them
p71
aVwas my first name.
p72
aVThey didn't know
p73
aVthat I was a head of a department at the Design Council.
p74
aVAnd here is my beloved briefcase,
p75
aValso rescued from that morning.
p76
aVThey didn't know that I published architecture and design journals,
p77
aVthat I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts,
p78
aVthat I wore black \u2014
p79
aVstill do \u2014
p80
aVthat I smoked cigarillos.
p81
aVI don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
p82
aVI drank gin and I watched TED Talks,
p83
aVof course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing,
p84
aVbalancing on prosthetic legs,
p85
aVgiving a talk.
p86
aa(lp87
VI was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London.
p88
aVAnd I wasn't ready for that all to end.
p89
aVI was so determined to survive
p90
aVthat I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs,
p91
aVand I just shut everything and everyone out,
p92
aVto focus, to listen to myself,
p93
aVto be guided by instinct alone.
p94
aVI lowered my breathing rate.
p95
aVI elevated my thighs.
p96
aVI held myself upright
p97
aVand I fought the urge to close my eyes.
p98
aa(lp99
VI held on for almost an hour,
p100
aVan hour to contemplate the whole of my life
p101
aVup until this point.
p102
aVPerhaps I should have done more.
p103
aVPerhaps I could have lived more, seen more.
p104
aVMaybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga.
p105
aVBut my priority and my focus was always my work.
p106
aVI lived to work.
p107
aVWho I was on my business card
p108
aVmattered to me.
p109
aVBut it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
p110
aa(lp111
VBy the time I felt that first touch
p112
aVfrom one of my rescuers,
p113
aVI was unable to speak,
p114
aVunable to say even a small word, like "Gill."
p115
aVI surrendered my body to them.
p116
aVI had done all I possibly could,
p117
aVand now I was in their hands.
p118
aa(lp119
VI understood
p120
aVjust who and what humanity really is,
p121
aVwhen I first saw the ID tag
p122
aVthat was given to me when I was admitted to hospital.
p123
aVAnd it read:
p124
aV"One unknown estimated female."
p125
aVOne unknown estimated female.
p126
aVThose four words were my gift.
p127
aVWhat they told me very clearly
p128
aVwas that my life was saved,
p129
aVpurely because I was a human being.
p130
aVDifference of any kind made no difference
p131
aVto the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go
p132
aVto save my life,
p133
aVto save as many unknowns as they could,
p134
aVand putting their own lives at risk.
p135
aVTo them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor,
p136
aVthe color of my skin,
p137
aVwhether I was male or female,
p138
aVmy sexual orientation,
p139
aVwho I voted for,
p140
aVwhether I was educated,
p141
aVif I had a faith or no faith at all.
p142
aVNothing mattered
p143
aVother than I was a precious human life.
p144
aa(lp145
VI see myself as a living fact.
p146
aVI am proof
p147
aVthat unconditional love and respect can not only save,
p148
aVbut it can transform lives.
p149
aVHere is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I
p150
aVtaken just last year.
p151
aVTen years after the event,
p152
aVand here we are, arm in arm.
p153
aa(lp154
VThroughout all the chaos,
p155
aVmy hand was held tightly.
p156
aVMy face was stroked gently.
p157
aVWhat did I feel?
p158
aVI felt loved.
p159
aVWhat's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution,
p160
aVwhat's given me the courage to say:
p161
aVthis ends with me
p162
aVis love.
p163
aVI was loved.
p164
aa(lp165
VI believe the potential for widespread positive change
p166
aVis absolutely enormous
p167
aVbecause I know what we're capable of.
p168
aVI know the brilliance of humanity.
p169
aVSo this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder
p170
aVand some questions for us all to consider:
p171
aVIs what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?
p172
aVDoes it have to take a tragedy or a disaster
p173
aVfor us to feel deeply connected as one species,
p174
aVas human beings?
p175
aVAnd when will we embrace the wisdom of our era
p176
aVto rise above mere tolerance
p177
aVand move to an acceptance
p178
aVfor all who are only a label until we know them?
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you.
