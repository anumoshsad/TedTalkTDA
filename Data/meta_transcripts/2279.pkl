VOur emotions influence every aspect of our lives,
p4
aVfrom our health and how we learn, to how we do business and make decisions,
p5
aVbig ones and small.
p6
aVOur emotions also influence how we connect with one another.
p7
aVWe've evolved to live in a world like this,
p8
aVbut instead, we're living more and more of our lives like this \u2014
p9
aVthis is the text message from my daughter last night \u2014
p10
aVin a world that's devoid of emotion.
p11
aVSo I'm on a mission to change that.
p12
aVI want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences.
p13
aa(lp14
VI started on this path 15 years ago.
p15
aVI was a computer scientist in Egypt,
p16
aVand I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University.
p17
aVSo I did something quite unusual
p18
aVfor a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife:
p19
aVWith the support of my husband, who had to stay in Egypt,
p20
aVI packed my bags and I moved to England.
p21
aVAt Cambridge, thousands of miles away from home,
p22
aVI realized I was spending more hours with my laptop
p23
aVthan I did with any other human.
p24
aVYet despite this intimacy, my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling.
p25
aVIt had no idea if I was happy,
p26
aVhaving a bad day, or stressed, confused,
p27
aVand so that got frustrating.
p28
aVEven worse, as I communicated online with my family back home,
p29
aVI felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace.
p30
aVI was homesick, I was lonely, and on some days I was actually crying,
p31
aVbut all I had to communicate these emotions was this.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVToday's technology has lots of I.Q., but no E.Q.;
p34
aVlots of cognitive intelligence, but no emotional intelligence.
p35
aVSo that got me thinking,
p36
aVwhat if our technology could sense our emotions?
p37
aVWhat if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly,
p38
aVjust the way an emotionally intelligent friend would?
p39
aVThose questions led me and my team
p40
aVto create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions,
p41
aVand our starting point was the human face.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels
p44
aVthat we all use to communicate social and emotional states,
p45
aVeverything from enjoyment, surprise,
p46
aVempathy and curiosity.
p47
aVIn emotion science, we call each facial muscle movement an action unit.
p48
aVSo for example, action unit 12,
p49
aVit's not a Hollywood blockbuster,
p50
aVit is actually a lip corner pull, which is the main component of a smile.
p51
aVTry it everybody. Let's get some smiles going on.
p52
aVAnother example is action unit 4. It's the brow furrow.
p53
aVIt's when you draw your eyebrows together
p54
aVand you create all these textures and wrinkles.
p55
aVWe don't like them, but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion.
p56
aVSo we have about 45 of these action units,
p57
aVand they combine to express hundreds of emotions.
p58
aa(lp59
VTeaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard,
p60
aVbecause these action units, they can be fast, they're subtle,
p61
aVand they combine in many different ways.
p62
aVSo take, for example, the smile and the smirk.
p63
aVThey look somewhat similar, but they mean very different things.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVSo the smile is positive,
p66
aVa smirk is often negative.
p67
aVSometimes a smirk can make you become famous.
p68
aVBut seriously, it's important for a computer to be able
p69
aVto tell the difference between the two expressions.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo how do we do that?
p72
aVWe give our algorithms
p73
aVtens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling,
p74
aVfrom different ethnicities, ages, genders,
p75
aVand we do the same for smirks.
p76
aVAnd then, using deep learning,
p77
aVthe algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles
p78
aVand shape changes on our face,
p79
aVand basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics,
p80
aVall smirks have subtly different characteristics.
p81
aVAnd the next time it sees a new face,
p82
aVit essentially learns that
p83
aVthis face has the same characteristics of a smile,
p84
aVand it says, "Aha, I recognize this. This is a smile expression."
p85
aa(lp86
VSo the best way to demonstrate how this technology works
p87
aVis to try a live demo,
p88
aVso I need a volunteer, preferably somebody with a face.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVCloe's going to be our volunteer today.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo over the past five years, we've moved from being a research project at MIT
p93
aVto a company,
p94
aVwhere my team has worked really hard to make this technology work,
p95
aVas we like to say, in the wild.
p96
aVAnd we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine
p97
aVworks on any mobile device with a camera, like this iPad.
p98
aVSo let's give this a try.
p99
aa(lp100
VAs you can see, the algorithm has essentially found Cloe's face,
p101
aVso it's this white bounding box,
p102
aVand it's tracking the main feature points on her face,
p103
aVso her eyebrows, her eyes, her mouth and her nose.
p104
aVThe question is, can it recognize her expression?
p105
aVSo we're going to test the machine.
p106
aVSo first of all, give me your poker face. Yep, awesome. (Laughter)
p107
aVAnd then as she smiles, this is a genuine smile, it's great.
p108
aVSo you can see the green bar go up as she smiles.
p109
aVNow that was a big smile.
p110
aVCan you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize?
p111
aVIt does recognize subtle smiles as well.
p112
aVWe've worked really hard to make that happen.
p113
aVAnd then eyebrow raised, indicator of surprise.
p114
aVBrow furrow, which is an indicator of confusion.
p115
aVFrown. Yes, perfect.
p116
aVSo these are all the different action units. There's many more of them.
p117
aVThis is just a slimmed-down demo.
p118
aVBut we call each reading an emotion data point,
p119
aVand then they can fire together to portray different emotions.
p120
aVSo on the right side of the demo \u2014 look like you're happy.
p121
aVSo that's joy. Joy fires up.
p122
aVAnd then give me a disgust face.
p123
aVTry to remember what it was like when Zayn left One Direction.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVYeah, wrinkle your nose. Awesome.
p126
aVAnd the valence is actually quite negative, so you must have been a big fan.
p127
aVSo valence is how positive or negative an experience is,
p128
aVand engagement is how expressive she is as well.
p129
aVSo imagine if Cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream,
p130
aVand she could share it with anybody she wanted to.
p131
aVThank you.
p132
aV(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, so far, we have amassed 12 billion of these emotion data points.
p135
aVIt's the largest emotion database in the world.
p136
aVWe've collected it from 2.9 million face videos,
p137
aVpeople who have agreed to share their emotions with us,
p138
aVand from 75 countries around the world.
p139
aVIt's growing every day.
p140
aVIt blows my mind away
p141
aVthat we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions,
p142
aVand we can do it at this scale.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo what have we learned to date?
p145
aVGender.
p146
aVOur data confirms something that you might suspect.
p147
aVWomen are more expressive than men.
p148
aVNot only do they smile more, their smiles last longer,
p149
aVand we can now really quantify what it is that men and women
p150
aVrespond to differently.
p151
aVLet's do culture: So in the United States,
p152
aVwomen are 40 percent more expressive than men,
p153
aVbut curiously, we don't see any difference in the U.K. between men and women.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVAge: People who are 50 years and older
p156
aVare 25 percent more emotive than younger people.
p157
aVWomen in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same age,
p158
aVperhaps a necessity for dating.
p159
aVBut perhaps what surprised us the most about this data
p160
aVis that we happen to be expressive all the time,
p161
aVeven when we are sitting in front of our devices alone,
p162
aVand it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook.
p163
aVWe are expressive when we're emailing, texting, shopping online,
p164
aVor even doing our taxes.
p165
aa(lp166
VWhere is this data used today?
p167
aVIn understanding how we engage with media,
p168
aVso understanding virality and voting behavior;
p169
aVand also empowering or emotion-enabling technology,
p170
aVand I want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart.
p171
aVEmotion-enabled wearable glasses can help individuals
p172
aVwho are visually impaired read the faces of others,
p173
aVand it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion,
p174
aVsomething that they really struggle with.
p175
aVIn education, imagine if your learning apps
p176
aVsense that you're confused and slow down,
p177
aVor that you're bored, so it's sped up,
p178
aVjust like a great teacher would in a classroom.
p179
aVWhat if your wristwatch tracked your mood,
p180
aVor your car sensed that you're tired,
p181
aVor perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed,
p182
aVso it auto-locks to prevent you from binge eating. (Laughter)
p183
aVI would like that, yeah.
p184
aVWhat if, when I was in Cambridge,
p185
aVI had access to my real-time emotion stream,
p186
aVand I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way,
p187
aVjust like I would've if we were all in the same room together?
p188
aa(lp189
VI think five years down the line,
p190
aVall our devices are going to have an emotion chip,
p191
aVand we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device
p192
aVand our device would say, "Hmm, you didn't like that, did you?"
p193
aVOur biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology,
p194
aVmy team and I realize that we can't build them all ourselves,
p195
aVso we've made this technology available so that other developers
p196
aVcan get building and get creative.
p197
aVWe recognize that there are potential risks
p198
aVand potential for abuse,
p199
aVbut personally, having spent many years doing this,
p200
aVI believe that the benefits to humanity
p201
aVfrom having emotionally intelligent technology
p202
aVfar outweigh the potential for misuse.
p203
aVAnd I invite you all to be part of the conversation.
p204
aVThe more people who know about this technology,
p205
aVthe more we can all have a voice in how it's being used.
p206
aVSo as more and more of our lives become digital,
p207
aVwe are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices
p208
aVin order to reclaim our emotions.
p209
aVSo what I'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology
p210
aVand make our technologies more responsive.
p211
aVSo I want those devices that have separated us
p212
aVto bring us back together.
p213
aVAnd by humanizing technology, we have this golden opportunity
p214
aVto reimagine how we connect with machines,
p215
aVand therefore, how we, as human beings,
p216
aVconnect with one another.
