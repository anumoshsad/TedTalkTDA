VI visit the future for a living.
p4
aVNot just one future,
p5
aVbut many possible futures,
p6
aVbringing back evidences from those futures for you to experience today.
p7
aVLike an archaeologist of the future.
p8
aVOver the years, my many journeys have brought back things
p9
aVlike a new species of synthetically engineered bees;
p10
aVa book named, "Pets as Protein;"
p11
aVa machine that makes you rich by trading your genetic data;
p12
aVa lamp powered by sugar;
p13
aVa computer for growing food.
p14
aa(lp15
VOK, so I don't actually travel to different futures \u2014 yet.
p16
aVBut my husband Jon and I spend a lot of time thinking
p17
aVand creating visions of different futures in our studio.
p18
aVWe are constantly looking out for weak signals,
p19
aVthose murmurs of future potential.
p20
aVThen we trace those threads of potential out into the future, asking:
p21
aVWhat might it feel like to live in this future?
p22
aVWhat might we see, hear and even breathe?
p23
aVThen we run experiments, build prototypes, make objects,
p24
aVbringing aspects of these futures to life,
p25
aVmaking them concrete and tangible
p26
aVso you can really feel the impact of those future possibilities
p27
aVhere and now.
p28
aVBut this work is not about predictions.
p29
aVIt's about creating tools \u2014
p30
aVtools that can help connect our present and our future selves
p31
aVso we become active participants in creating a future we want \u2014
p32
aVa future that works for all.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo how do we go about doing this?
p35
aVFor a recent project called Drone Aviary,
p36
aVwe were interested in exploring
p37
aVwhat it would mean to live with drones in our cities.
p38
aVDrones that have the power to see things we can't,
p39
aVto go places we can't
p40
aVand to do so with increasing autonomy.
p41
aVBut to understand the technology,
p42
aVgetting our hands dirty was crucial.
p43
aVSo we built several different drones in our studio.
p44
aVWe gave them names, functions and then flew them \u2014
p45
aVbut not without difficulty.
p46
aVThings came loose,
p47
aVGPS signals glitched
p48
aVand drones crashed.
p49
aVBut it was through such experimentation
p50
aVthat we could construct a very concrete and very experiential slice
p51
aVof one possible future.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo now, let's go to that future.
p54
aVLet's imagine we are living in a city with drones like this one.
p55
aVWe call it The Nightwatchman.
p56
aVIt patrols the streets, often spotted in the evenings and at night.
p57
aVInitially, many of us were annoyed by its low, dull hum.
p58
aVBut then, like everything else, we got used to it.
p59
aVNow, what if you could see the world through its eyes?
p60
aVSee how it constantly logs every resident of our neighborhood;
p61
aVlogging the kids who play football in the no-ballgame area
p62
aVand marking them as statutory nuisances.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd then see how it disperses this other group, who are teenagers,
p67
aVwith the threat of an autonomously issued injunction.
p68
aVAnd then there's this giant floating disc called Madison.
p69
aVIts glaring presence is so overpowering,
p70
aVI can't help but stare at it.
p71
aVBut if feels like each time I look at it,
p72
aVit knows a little more about me \u2014
p73
aVlike it keeps flashing all these Brianair adverts at me,
p74
aVas if it knows about the holiday I'm planning.
p75
aVI'm not sure if I find this mildly entertaining
p76
aVor just entirely invasive.
p77
aa(lp78
VBack to the present.
p79
aVIn creating this future, we learned a lot.
p80
aVNot just about how these machines work,
p81
aVbut what it would feel like to live alongside them.
p82
aVWhilst drones like Madison and Nightwatchman,
p83
aVin these particular forms,
p84
aVare not real yet,
p85
aVmost elements of a drone future are in fact very real today.
p86
aVFor instance,
p87
aVfacial recognition systems are everywhere \u2014
p88
aVin our phones, even in our thermostats
p89
aVand in cameras around our cities \u2014
p90
aVkeeping a record of everything we do,
p91
aVwhether it's an advertisement we glanced at or a protest we attended.
p92
aVThese things are here,
p93
aVand we often don't understand how they work,
p94
aVand what their consequences could be.
p95
aVAnd we see this all around us.
p96
aVThis difficulty in even imagining
p97
aVhow the consequences of our actions today will affect our future.
p98
aa(lp99
VLast year, where I live, in the UK, there was a referendum
p100
aVwhere the people could vote for the UK to leave the EU
p101
aVor stay in the EU,
p102
aVpopularly known as "Brexit."
p103
aVAnd soon after the results came out,
p104
aVa word began to surface called "Bregret" \u2014
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
Vdescribing people who chose to vote for Brexit as a protest,
p109
aVbut without thinking through its potential consequences.
p110
aVAnd this disconnect is evident in some of the simplest things.
p111
aVSay you go out for a quick drink.
p112
aVThen you decide you wouldn't mind a few more.
p113
aVYou know you'll wake up in the morning feeling awful,
p114
aVbut you justify it by saying,
p115
aV"The other me in the future will deal with that."
p116
aVBut as we find out in the morning,
p117
aVthat future "you" is you.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhen I was growing up in India in the late '70s and early '80s,
p120
aVthere was a feeling
p121
aVthat the future both needed to and could actually be planned.
p122
aVI remember my parents had to plan for some of the simplest things.
p123
aVWhen they wanted a telephone in our house,
p124
aVthey needed to order it and then wait \u2014
p125
aVwait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd then if they wanted to call my grandparents who lived in another city,
p130
aVthey needed to book something called a "trunk call,"
p131
aVand then wait again, for hours or even days.
p132
aVAnd then abruptly, the phone would ring at two in the morning,
p133
aVand all of us would jump out of our beds and gather round the phone,
p134
aVshrieking into it, discussing general well-being
p135
aVat two in the morning.
p136
aa(lp137
VToday it can feel like things are happening too fast \u2014
p138
aVso fast, that it can become really difficult
p139
aVfor us to form an understanding of our place in history.
p140
aVIt creates an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and anxiety,
p141
aVand so, we let the future just happen to us.
p142
aVWe don't connect with that future "us."
p143
aVWe treat our future selves as a stranger,
p144
aVand the future as a foreign land.
p145
aVIt's not a foreign land;
p146
aVit's unfolding right in front of us,
p147
aVcontinually being shaped by our actions today.
p148
aVWe are that future,
p149
aVand so I believe fighting for a future we want
p150
aVis more urgent and necessary than ever before.
p151
aa(lp152
VWe have learned in our work
p153
aVthat one of the most powerful means of effecting change
p154
aVis when people can directly, tangibly and emotionally experience
p155
aVsome of the future consequences of their actions today.
p156
aVEarlier this year, the government of the United Arab Emirates invited us
p157
aVto help them shape their country's energy strategy
p158
aVall the way up to 2050.
p159
aVBased on the government's econometric data, we created this large city model,
p160
aVand visualized many possible futures on it.
p161
aVAs I was excitably taking a group of government officials
p162
aVand members of energy companies
p163
aVthrough one sustainable future on our model,
p164
aVone of the participants told me,
p165
aV"I cannot imagine that in the future people will stop driving cars
p166
aVand start using public transport."
p167
aVAnd then he said,
p168
aV"There's no way I can tell my own son to stop driving his car."
p169
aa(lp170
VBut we were prepared for this reaction.
p171
aVWorking with scientists in a chemistry lab in my home city in India,
p172
aVwe had created approximate samples
p173
aVof what the air would be like in 2030 if our behavior stays the same.
p174
aVAnd so, I walked the group over to this object
p175
aVthat emits vapor from those air samples.
p176
aVJust one whiff of the noxious polluted air from 2030
p177
aVbrought home the point that no amount of data can.
p178
aVThis is not the future you would want your children to inherit.
p179
aVThe next day, the government made a big announcement.
p180
aVThey would be investing billions of dollars in renewables.
p181
aVWe don't know what part our future experiences played in this decision,
p182
aVbut we know that they've changed their energy policy
p183
aVto mitigate such a scenario.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhile something like air from the future is very effective and tangible,
p186
aVthe trajectory from our present to a future consequence
p187
aVis not always so linear.
p188
aVEven when a technology is developed with utopian ideals,
p189
aVthe moment it leaves the laboratory and enters the world,
p190
aVit is subject to forces outside of the creators' control.
p191
aVFor one particular project, we investigated medical genomics:
p192
aVthe technology of gathering and using people's genetic data
p193
aVto create personalized medicine.
p194
aVWe were asking:
p195
aVWhat are some of the unintended consequences of linking our genetics
p196
aVto health care?
p197
aVTo explore this question further,
p198
aVwe created a fictional lawsuit,
p199
aVand brought it to life through 31 pieces of carefully crafted evidence.
p200
aVSo we built an illegal genetic clinic,
p201
aVa DIY carbon dioxide incubator,
p202
aVand even bought frozen mice on eBay.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo now let's go to that future where this lawsuit is unfolding,
p205
aVand meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.
p206
aVArnold is being prosecuted by this global giant biotech company
p207
aVcalled Dynamic Genetics,
p208
aVbecause they have evidence
p209
aVthat Arnold has illegally inserted the company's patented genetic material
p210
aVinto his body.
p211
aVHow on earth did Arnold manage to do that?
p212
aVWell, it all started
p213
aVwhen Arnold was asked to submit a saliva sample in this spit kit
p214
aVto the NHI \u2014
p215
aVthe UK's National Health Insurance service.
p216
aVWhen Arnold received his health insurance bill,
p217
aVhe was shocked and scared
p218
aVto see that his premiums had gone through the roof,
p219
aVbeyond anything he or his family could ever afford.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe state's algorithm had scanned his genetic data
p222
aVand found the risk of a chronic health condition lurking in his DNA.
p223
aVAnd so Arnold had to start paying toward the potential costs
p224
aVof that future disease \u2014
p225
aVpotential future disease from today.
p226
aVIn that moment of fear and panic,
p227
aVArnold slipped through the city
p228
aVinto the dark shadows of this illegal clinic for treatment \u2014
p229
aVa treatment that would modify his DNA
p230
aVso that the state's algorithm would no longer see him as a risk,
p231
aVand his insurance premiums would become affordable again.
p232
aVBut Arnold was caught.
p233
aVAnd the legal proceedings in the case Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.
p234
aa(lp235
VIn bringing such a future to life,
p236
aVwhat was important to us was that people could actually touch,
p237
aVsee and feel its potential,
p238
aVbecause such an immediate and close encounter provokes people
p239
aVto ask the right questions,
p240
aVquestions like:
p241
aVWhat are the implications of living in a world
p242
aVwhere I'm judged on my genetics?
p243
aVOr: Who might claim ownership to my genetic data,
p244
aVand what might they do with it?
p245
aVIf this feels even slightly out-there or farfetched,
p246
aVtoday there's a little-known bill being passed through the American congress
p247
aVknown as HR 1313, Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act.
p248
aVThis bill proposes to amend the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act,
p249
aVpopularly known as GINA,
p250
aVand would allow employers to ask about family medical history
p251
aVand genetic data
p252
aVto all employees for the first time.
p253
aVThose who refuse would face large penalties.
p254
aa(lp255
VIn the work I've shown so far,
p256
aVwhether it was drones or genetic crimes,
p257
aVthese stories describe troubling futures
p258
aVwith the intention of helping us avoid those futures.
p259
aVBut what about what we can't avoid?
p260
aVToday, especially with climate change,
p261
aVit looks like we are heading for trouble.
p262
aVAnd so what we want to do now is to prepare for that future
p263
aVby developing tools and attitudes that can help us find hope \u2014
p264
aVhope that can inspire action.
p265
aa(lp266
VCurrently, we are running an experiment in our studio.
p267
aVIt's a work in progress.
p268
aVBased on climate data projections,
p269
aVwe are exploring a future
p270
aVwhere the Western world has moved from abundance to scarcity.
p271
aVWe imagine living in a future city with repeated flooding,
p272
aVperiods with almost no food in supermarkets,
p273
aVeconomic instabilities,
p274
aVbroken supply chains.
p275
aVWhat can we do to not just survive, but prosper in such a world?
p276
aVWhat food can we eat?
p277
aa(lp278
VTo really step inside these questions,
p279
aVwe are building this room in a flat in London from 2050.
p280
aVIt's like a little time capsule that we reclaimed from the future.
p281
aVWe stripped it down to the bare minimum.
p282
aVEverything we lovingly put in our homes,
p283
aVlike flat-panel TVs,
p284
aVinternet-connected fridges
p285
aVand artisanal furnishings
p286
aVall had to go.
p287
aVAnd in its place, we're building food computers
p288
aVfrom abandoned, salvaged and repurposed materials,
p289
aVturning today's waste into tomorrow's dinner.
p290
aVFor instance,
p291
aVwe've just finished building our first fully automated fogponics machine.
p292
aVIt uses the technique of fogponics \u2014 so just fog as a nutrient,
p293
aVnot even water or soil \u2014
p294
aVto grow things quickly.
p295
aVAt the moment,
p296
aVwe have successfully grown tomatoes.
p297
aVBut we'll need more food than what we can grow in this small room.
p298
aVSo what else could we forage from the city?
p299
aVInsects? Pigeons? Foxes?
p300
aa(lp301
VEarlier, we brought back air from the future.
p302
aVThis time we are bringing an entire room from the future,
p303
aVa room full of hope, tools and tactics
p304
aVto create positive action in hostile conditions.
p305
aVSpending time in this room,
p306
aVa room that could be our own future home,
p307
aVmakes the consequences of climate change and food insecurity
p308
aVmuch more immediate and tangible.
p309
aa(lp310
VWhat we're learning through such experiments and our practice
p311
aVand the people we engage with
p312
aVis that creating concrete experiences
p313
aVcan bridge the disconnect between today and tomorrow.
p314
aVBy putting ourselves into different possible futures,
p315
aVby becoming open and willing
p316
aVto embrace the uncertainty and discomfort that such an act can bring,
p317
aVwe have the opportunity to imagine new possibilities.
p318
aVWe can find optimistic futures;
p319
aVwe can find paths forward;
p320
aVwe can move beyond hope into action.
p321
aVIt means we have the chance to change direction,
p322
aVa chance to have our voices heard,
p323
aVa chance to write ourselves into a future we want.
p324
aVOther worlds are possible.
