VSome months back, I was visiting this East African city,
p4
aVand we were stuck in traffic.
p5
aVAnd this vendor suddenly approaches my window
p6
aVwith a half-opened alphabet sheet.
p7
aVI took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,
p8
aVand I thought of my daughter,
p9
aVhow it would be nice to spread it on the floor
p10
aVand just play all over it with her
p11
aVwhile getting her to learn the alphabet.
p12
aVSo the traffic moved a bit, and I quickly grabbed a copy,
p13
aVand we moved on.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhen I had time to fully open the alphabet sheet
p16
aVand take a more detailed look at it,
p17
aVI knew I was not going to use that to teach my daughter.
p18
aVI regretted my purchase.
p19
aVWhy so?
p20
aVLooking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact
p21
aVthat not much has changed
p22
aVin the education curricula in Africa.
p23
aVSome decades back, I was taught out of a similar alphabet sheet.
p24
aVAnd because of that, I struggled for years.
p25
aVI struggled to reconcile my reality with the formal education I received
p26
aVin school, in the schools I attended.
p27
aVI had identity crises.
p28
aVI looked down on my reality.
p29
aVI looked at my ancestry, I looked at my lineage with disrespect.
p30
aVI had very little patience for what my life had to offer around me.
p31
aa(lp32
VWhy?
p33
aV"A is for apple."
p34
aV"A is for apple."
p35
aV"A is for apple" is for that child in that part of the world
p36
aVwhere apples grow out;
p37
aVwho has an apple in her lunch bag;
p38
aVwho goes to the grocery store with her mom and sees red,
p39
aVgreen, yellow \u2014 apples of all shapes and colors and sizes.
p40
aVAnd so, introducing education to this child
p41
aVwith an alphabet sheet like this
p42
aVfulfills one of the major functions of education,
p43
aVwhich is to introduce the learner
p44
aVto an appreciation of the learner's environment
p45
aVand a curiosity to explore more in order to add value.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn my own case,
p48
aVwhen and where I grew up in Africa,
p49
aVapple was an exotic fruit.
p50
aVTwo or three times a year,
p51
aVI could get some yellowish apples with brown dots, you know,
p52
aVsignifying thousands of miles traveled \u2014 warehouses storing \u2014
p53
aVto get to me.
p54
aVI grew up in the city
p55
aVto very financially comfortable parents,
p56
aVso it was my dignified reality,
p57
aVexactly the same way
p58
aVcassava fufu or ugali would not regularly feature
p59
aVin an American, Chinese or Indian diet,
p60
aVapples didn't count as part of my reality.
p61
aVSo what this did to me,
p62
aVintroducing education to me with "A is for apple,"
p63
aVmade education an abstraction.
p64
aVIt made it something out of my reach \u2014
p65
aVa foreign concept,
p66
aVa phenomenon for which I would have to constantly and perpetually seek
p67
aVthe validation of those it belonged to
p68
aVfor me to make progress within it and with it.
p69
aVThat was tough for a child; it would be tough for anyone.
p70
aa(lp71
VAs I grew up and I advanced academically,
p72
aVmy reality was further separated from my education.
p73
aVIn history, I was taught
p74
aVthat the Scottish explorer Mungo Park discovered the Niger River.
p75
aVAnd so it bothered me.
p76
aVMy great-great-grandparents grew up
p77
aVquite close to the edge of the Niger River.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd it took someone to travel thousands of miles from Europe
p82
aVto discover a river right under their nose?
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VNo!
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause and cheers)
p89
aa(lp90
VWhat did they do with their time?
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VPlaying board games, roasting fresh yams,
p95
aVfighting tribal wars?
p96
aVI mean, I just knew my education was preparing me to go somewhere else
p97
aVand practice and give to another environment that it belonged to.
p98
aVIt was not for my environment, where and when I grew up.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd this continued.
p101
aVThis philosophy undergirded my studies
p102
aVall through the time I studied in Africa.
p103
aVIt took a lot of experiences and some studies
p104
aVfor me to begin to have a change of mindset.
p105
aVI will share a couple of the remarkable ones with us.
p106
aa(lp107
VI was in the United States in Washington, DC
p108
aVstudying towards my doctorate,
p109
aVand I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region.
p110
aVAnd so I remember one day,
p111
aVmy boss \u2014 we were having a conversation on some project,
p112
aVand he mentioned a particular World Bank project,
p113
aVa large-scale irrigation project that cost millions of dollars
p114
aVin Niger Republic
p115
aVthat was faltering sustainably.
p116
aVHe said this project wasn't so sustainable,
p117
aVand it bothered those that instituted the whole package.
p118
aVBut then he mentioned a particular project,
p119
aVa particular traditional irrigation method that was hugely successful
p120
aVin the same Niger Republic where the World Bank project was failing.
p121
aVAnd that got me thinking.
p122
aVSo I did further research,
p123
aVand I found out about Tassa.
p124
aa(lp125
VTassa is a traditional irrigation method
p126
aVwhere 20- to 30-centimeter-wide and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes
p127
aVare dug across a field to be cultivated.
p128
aVThen, a small dam is constructed around the field,
p129
aVand then crops are planted across the surface area.
p130
aVWhat happens is that when rain falls,
p131
aVthe holes are able to store the water
p132
aVand appropriate it to the extent that the plant needs the water.
p133
aVThe plant can only assimilate as much water as needed
p134
aVuntil harvest time.
p135
aVNiger is 75 percent scorched desert,
p136
aVso this is something that is a life-or-death situation,
p137
aVand it has been used for centuries.
p138
aVIn an experiment that was conducted,
p139
aVtwo similar plots of land were used in the experiment,
p140
aVand one plot of land
p141
aVdid not have the Tassa technique on it.
p142
aVSimilar plots.
p143
aVThe other one had Tassa technique constructed on it.
p144
aVThen similar grains of millet also were planted on both plots.
p145
aVDuring harvest time,
p146
aVthe plot of land without Tassa technique
p147
aVyielded 11 kilograms of millet per hectare.
p148
aVThe plot of land with Tassa technique
p149
aVyielded 553 kilograms of millet per hectare.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VI looked at the research, and I looked at myself.
p154
aVI said, "I studied agriculture for 12 years,
p155
aVfrom primary to Senior Six, as we say in East Africa,
p156
aVSS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.
p157
aVNo one ever taught me
p158
aVof any form of traditional African knowledge of cultivation \u2014
p159
aVof harvesting, of anything \u2014
p160
aVthat will work in modern times and actually succeed,
p161
aVwhere something imported from the West would struggle to succeed.
p162
aVThat was when I knew the challenge,
p163
aVthe challenge of Africa's curricula,
p164
aVAnd I thus began my quest to dedicate my life, concern my life work,
p165
aVto studying, conducting research on Africa's own knowledge system
p166
aVand being able to advocate for its mainstreaming
p167
aVin education, in research, policy
p168
aVacross sectors and industries.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnother conversation and experience I had at the bank
p171
aVI guess made me take that final decision of where I was going to go,
p172
aVeven though it wasn't the most lucrative research to go into,
p173
aVbut it was just about what I believed in.
p174
aVAnd so one day, my boss said that he likes to go to Africa
p175
aVto negotiate World Bank loans and to work on World Bank projects.
p176
aVAnd I was intrigued. I asked him why.
p177
aVHe said, "Oh, when I go to Africa,
p178
aVit's so easy.
p179
aVI just write up my loan documents and my project proposal in Washington, DC,
p180
aVI go to Africa, and they all just get signed.
p181
aVI get the best deal, and I'm back to base.
p182
aVMy bosses are happy with me."
p183
aa(lp184
VBut then he said, "I hate going to Asia or ..."
p185
aVand he mentioned a particular country, Asia and some of these countries.
p186
aV"They keep me for this, trying to get the best deal for their countries.
p187
aVThey get the best deal.
p188
aVThey tell me, 'Oh, that clause will not work for us
p189
aVin our environment.
p190
aVIt's not our reality. It's just so Western.'
p191
aVAnd they tell me, 'Oh, we have enough experts
p192
aVto take care of this.
p193
aVYou don't have enough experts.
p194
aVWe know our aim.'
p195
aVAnd they just keep going through all these things.
p196
aVBy the time they finish, yes, they get the best deal,
p197
aVbut I'm so exhausted and I don't get the best deal for the bank,
p198
aVand we're in business."
p199
aV"Really?" I thought in my head, "OK."
p200
aa(lp201
VI was privileged to sit in on a loan negotiating session
p202
aVin an African country.
p203
aVSo I would do these consultancy positions during summer,
p204
aVyou know, since I was a doctoral student.
p205
aVAnd then I traveled with the team, with the World Bank team,
p206
aVas more like someone to help out with organizational matters.
p207
aVBut I sat in during the negotiating session.
p208
aVI had mostly Euro-Americans, you know, with me from Washington, DC.
p209
aVAnd I looked across the table at my African brothers and sisters.
p210
aVI could see intimidation on their faces.
p211
aVThey didn't believe they had anything to offer
p212
aVthe great-great-grandchildren of Mungo Park \u2014
p213
aVthe owners of "apple" in "A is for apple."
p214
aVThey just sat and watched: "Oh, just give us, let us sign.
p215
aVYou own the knowledge. You know it all.
p216
aVJust, where do we sign? Show us, let us sign."
p217
aVThey had no voice. They didn't believe in themselves.
p218
aa(lp219
VExcuse me.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd so,
p222
aVI have been doing this for a decade.
p223
aVI have been conducting research on Africa's knowledge system,
p224
aVoriginal, authentic, traditional knowledge.
p225
aVIn the few cases where this has been implemented in Africa,
p226
aVthere has been remarkable successes recorded.
p227
aa(lp228
VI think of Gacaca.
p229
aVGacaca is Rwanda's traditional judicial system
p230
aVthat was used after the genocide.
p231
aVIn 1994, when the genocide ended,
p232
aVRwanda's national court system was in shambles:
p233
aVno judges, no lawyers to try hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.
p234
aVSo the government of Rwanda came up with this idea
p235
aVto resuscitate a traditional judicial system known as Gacaca.
p236
aVGacaca is a community-based judicial system,
p237
aVwhere community members come together
p238
aVto elect men and women of proven integrity
p239
aVto try cases of crimes committed within these communities.
p240
aVSo by the time Gacaca concluded its trial of genocide cases in 2012,
p241
aV12,000 community-based courts had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.
p242
aVThat's a record.
p243
aa(lp244
V(Applause)
p245
aa(lp246
VMost importantly is that Gacaca emphasized Rwanda's traditional philosophy
p247
aVof reconciliation and reintegration,
p248
aVas against the whole punitive and banishment idea
p249
aVthat undergirds present-day Western style.
p250
aVAnd not to compare, but just to say that it really emphasized
p251
aVRwanda's traditional method of philosophy.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,
p254
aVformer president of Tanzania \u2014
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
Vwho said that you cannot develop people.
p259
aVPeople will have to develop themselves.
p260
aVI agree with Mwalimu.
p261
aVI am convinced
p262
aVthat Africa's further transformation, Africa's advancement,
p263
aVrests simply in the acknowledgment, validation and mainstreaming
p264
aVof Africa's own traditional, authentic, original, indigenous knowledge
p265
aVin education, in research, in policy making and across sectors.
p266
aVThis is not going to be easy for Africa.
p267
aVIt is not going to be easy for a people used to being told how to think,
p268
aVwhat to do, how to go about it,
p269
aVa people long subjected to the intellectual guidance
p270
aVand direction of others,
p271
aVbe they the colonial masters,
p272
aVaid industry or international news media.
p273
aVBut it is a task that we have to do to make progress.
p274
aa(lp275
VI am strengthened by the words of Joseph Shabalala,
p276
aVfounder of the South African choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
p277
aVHe said that the task ahead of us can never, ever be greater
p278
aVthan the power within us.
p279
aVWe can do it.
p280
aVWe can unlearn looking down on ourselves.
p281
aVWe can learn to place value on our reality and our knowledge.
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Swahili) Thank you very much.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause)
p288
