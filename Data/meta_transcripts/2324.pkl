VToday I'm going to talk about work.
p4
aVAnd the question I want to ask and answer is this:
p5
aV"Why do we work?"
p6
aVWhy do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning
p7
aVinstead of living our lives
p8
aVjust filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another?
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VYou may be asking yourselves that very question.
p13
aVNow, I know of course, we have to make a living,
p14
aVbut nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question,
p15
aV"Why do we work?"
p16
aVFor folks in this room, the work we do is challenging,
p17
aVit's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful.
p18
aVAnd if we're lucky, it might even be important.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid,
p21
aVbut that's not why we do what we do.
p22
aVAnd in general,
p23
aVI think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason
p24
aVfor doing the work that we do.
p25
aVWhen we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money,"
p26
aVwe are not just being descriptive.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, I think this is totally obvious,
p31
aVbut the very obviousness of it raises what is for me
p32
aVan incredibly profound question.
p33
aVWhy, if this is so obvious,
p34
aVwhy is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet,
p35
aVthe work they do has none of the characteristics
p36
aVthat get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning?
p37
aVHow is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet
p38
aVto do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening?
p39
aVWhy is it that as capitalism developed,
p40
aVit created a mode of production, of goods and services,
p41
aVin which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated?
p42
aVWorkers who do this kind of work,
p43
aVwhether they do it in factories, in call centers,
p44
aVor in fulfillment warehouses,
p45
aVdo it for pay.
p46
aVThere is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo the question is, "Why?"
p49
aVAnd here's the answer:
p50
aVthe answer is technology.
p51
aVNow, I know, I know \u2014
p52
aVyeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah \u2014
p53
aVthat's not what I mean.
p54
aVI'm not talking about the kind of technology
p55
aVthat has enveloped our lives, and that people come to TED to hear about.
p56
aVI'm not talking about the technology of things,
p57
aVprofound though that is.
p58
aVI'm talking about another technology.
p59
aVI'm talking about the technology of ideas.
p60
aVI call it, "idea technology" \u2014
p61
aVhow clever of me.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VIn addition to creating things, science creates ideas.
p66
aVScience creates ways of understanding.
p67
aVAnd in the social sciences,
p68
aVthe ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves.
p69
aVAnd they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to,
p70
aVand how we act.
p71
aa(lp72
VIf you think your poverty is God's will, you pray.
p73
aVIf you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy,
p74
aVyou shrink into despair.
p75
aVAnd if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination,
p76
aVthen you rise up in revolt.
p77
aVWhether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution,
p78
aVdepends on how you understand the sources of your poverty.
p79
aVThis is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings,
p80
aVand this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology
p81
aVthat science gives us.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd there's something special about idea technology,
p84
aVthat makes it different from the technology of things.
p85
aVWith things, if the technology sucks,
p86
aVit just vanishes, right?
p87
aVBad technology disappears.
p88
aVWith ideas \u2014
p89
aVfalse ideas about human beings will not go away
p90
aVif people believe that they're true.
p91
aVBecause if people believe that they're true,
p92
aVthey create ways of living and institutions
p93
aVthat are consistent with these very false ideas.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system
p96
aVin which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work,
p97
aVexcept for the pay at the end of the day.
p98
aVBecause the father \u2014 one of the fathers
p99
aVof the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith \u2014
p100
aVwas convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy,
p101
aVand wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while,
p102
aVand the way you made it worth their while
p103
aVwas by incentivizing, by giving them rewards.
p104
aVThat was the only reason anyone ever did anything.
p105
aVSo we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature.
p106
aVBut once that system of production was in place,
p107
aVthere was really no other way for people to operate,
p108
aVexcept in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision.
p109
aVSo the work example is merely an example
p110
aVof how false ideas can create a circumstance
p111
aVthat ends up making them true.
p112
aa(lp113
VIt is not true
p114
aVthat you "just can't get good help anymore."
p115
aVIt is true
p116
aVthat you "can't get good help anymore"
p117
aVwhen you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless.
p118
aVAnd interestingly enough, Adam Smith \u2014
p119
aVthe same guy who gave us this incredible invention
p120
aVof mass production, and division of labor
p121
aV\u2014 understood this.
p122
aVHe said, of people who worked in assembly lines,
p123
aVof men who worked in assembly lines, he says:
p124
aV"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."
p125
aVNow, notice the word here is "become."
p126
aV"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."
p127
aVWhether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there,
p128
aVis that the very shape of the institution within which people work
p129
aVcreates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution
p130
aVand deprives people of the opportunity
p131
aVto derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe thing about science \u2014 natural science \u2014
p134
aVis that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos,
p135
aVand have complete confidence
p136
aVthat the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories.
p137
aVIt's going to work the same damn way
p138
aVno matter what theories we have about the cosmos.
p139
aVBut we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature,
p140
aVbecause human nature will be changed by the theories we have
p141
aVthat are designed to explain and help us understand human beings.
p142
aa(lp143
VThe distinguished anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,
p144
aVthat human beings are the "unfinished animals."
p145
aVAnd what he meant by that was that it is only human nature
p146
aVto have a human nature
p147
aVthat is very much the product of the society in which people live.
p148
aVThat human nature, that is to say our human nature,
p149
aVis much more created than it is discovered.
p150
aVWe design human nature
p151
aVby designing the institutions within which people live and work.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so you people \u2014
p154
aVpretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe \u2014
p155
aVyou people should be asking yourself a question,
p156
aVas you go back home to run your organizations.
p157
aVJust what kind of human nature do you want to help design?
p158
aa(lp159
VThank you.
p160

V(Applause)

aa(lp163
