VSpace,
p4
aVwe all know what it looks like.
p5
aVWe've been surrounded by images of space
p6
aVour whole lives,
p7
aVfrom the speculative images
p8
aVof science fiction
p9
aVto the inspirational visions of artists
p10
aVto the increasingly beautiful pictures
p11
aVmade possible by complex technologies.
p12
aVBut whilst we have
p13
aVan overwhelmingly vivid
p14
aVvisual understanding of space,
p15
aVwe have no sense of what space sounds like.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd indeed, most people associate space with silence.
p18
aVBut the story of how
p19
aVwe came to understand the universe
p20
aVis just as much a story of listening
p21
aVas it is by looking.
p22
aVAnd yet despite this,
p23
aVhardly any of us have ever heard space.
p24
aVHow many of you here
p25
aVcould describe the sound
p26
aVof a single planet or star?
p27
aVWell in case you've ever wondered,
p28
aVthis is what the Sun sounds like.

p34
aa(lp35

p38
aa(lp39
VAnd this is the space probe Cassini
p40
aVpirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Crackling)
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is a a highly condensed clump
p45
aVof neutral matter,
p46
aVspinning in the distant universe.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Tapping)
p49
aa(lp50
VSo my artistic practice
p51
aVis all about listening
p52
aVto the weird and wonderful noises
p53
aVemitted by the magnificent celestial objects
p54
aVthat make up our universe.
p55
aVAnd you may wonder,
p56
aVhow do we know what these sounds are?
p57
aVHow can we tell the difference
p58
aVbetween the sound of the Sun
p59
aVand the sound of a pulsar?
p60
aVWell the answer
p61
aVis the science of radio astronomy.
p62
aVRadio astronomers
p63
aVstudy radio waves from space
p64
aVusing sensitive antennas and receivers,
p65
aVwhich give them precise information
p66
aVabout what an astronomical object is
p67
aVand where it is in our night sky.
p68
aVAnd just like the signals
p69
aVthat we send and receive here on Earth,
p70
aVwe can convert these transmissions into sound
p71
aVusing simple analog techniques.
p72
aVAnd therefore, it's through listening
p73
aVthat we've come to uncover
p74
aVsome of the universe's most important secrets \u2014
p75
aVits scale, what it's made of
p76
aVand even how old it is.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo today, I'm going to tell you a short story
p79
aVof the history of the universe through listening.
p80
aVIt's punctuated
p81
aVby three quick anecdotes,
p82
aVwhich show how accidental encounters
p83
aVwith strange noises
p84
aVgave us some of the most important information
p85
aVwe have about space.
p86
aVNow this story doesn't start
p87
aVwith vast telescopes
p88
aVor futuristic spacecraft,
p89
aVbut a rather more humble technology \u2014
p90
aVand in fact, the very medium
p91
aVwhich gave us the telecommunications revolution
p92
aVthat we're all part of today:
p93
aVthe telephone.
p94
aa(lp95
VIt's 1876, it's in Boston,
p96
aVand this is Alexander Graham Bell
p97
aVwho was working with Thomas Watson
p98
aVon the invention of the telephone.
p99
aVA key part of their technical set up
p100
aVwas a half-mile long length of wire,
p101
aVwhich was thrown across the rooftops
p102
aVof several houses in Boston.
p103
aVThe line carried the telephone signals
p104
aVthat would later make Bell a household name.
p105
aVBut like any long length of charged wire,
p106
aVit also inadvertently became
p107
aVan antenna.
p108
aVThomas Watson
p109
aVspent hours listening
p110
aVto the strange crackles and hisses
p111
aVand chirps and whistles
p112
aVthat his accidental antenna detected.
p113
aVNow you have to remember,
p114
aVthis is 10 years before
p115
aVHeinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves \u2014
p116
aV15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit \u2014
p117
aVnearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.
p118
aVSo Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.
p119
aVWe didn't have the technology
p120
aVto transmit.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo what were these strange noises?
p123
aVWatson was in fact listening
p124
aVto very low-frequency radio emissions
p125
aVcaused by nature.
p126
aVSome of the crackles and pops were lightning,
p127
aVbut the eerie whistles
p128
aVand curiously melodious chirps
p129
aVhad a rather more exotic origin.
p130
aVUsing the very first telephone,
p131
aVWatson was in fact
p132
aVdialed into the heavens.
p133
aVAs he correctly guessed,
p134
aVsome of these sounds were caused
p135
aVby activity on the surface of the Sun.
p136
aVIt was a solar wind
p137
aVinteracting with our ionosphere
p138
aVthat he was listening to \u2014
p139
aVa phenomena which we can see
p140
aVat the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet
p141
aVas the aurora.
p142
aVSo whilst inventing the technology
p143
aVthat would usher in the telecommunications revolution,
p144
aVWatson had discovered
p145
aVthat the star at the center of our solar system
p146
aVemitted powerful radio waves.
p147
aVHe had accidentally been the first person
p148
aVto tune in to them.
p149
aa(lp150
VFast-forward 50 years,
p151
aVand Bell and Watson's technology
p152
aVhas completely transformed
p153
aVglobal communications.
p154
aVBut going from slinging some wire
p155
aVacross rooftops in Boston
p156
aVto laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable
p157
aVon the Atlantic Ocean seabed
p158
aVis no easy matter.
p159
aVAnd so before long,
p160
aVBell were looking to new technologies
p161
aVto optimize their revolution.
p162
aVRadio could carry sound without wires.
p163
aVBut the medium is lossy \u2014
p164
aVit's subject to a lot of noise and interference.
p165
aVSo Bell employed an engineer
p166
aVto study those noises,
p167
aVto try and find out where they came from,
p168
aVwith a view towards building
p169
aVthe perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them
p170
aVso they could think about using radio
p171
aVfor the purposes of telephony.
p172
aa(lp173
VMost of the noises
p174
aVthat the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated
p175
aVwere fairly prosaic in origin.
p176
aVThey turned out to be lightning
p177
aVor sources of electrical power.
p178
aVBut there was one persistent noise
p179
aVthat Jansky couldn't identify,
p180
aVand it seemed to appear
p181
aVin his radio headset
p182
aVfour minutes earlier each day.
p183
aVNow any astronomer will tell you,
p184
aVthis is the telltale sign
p185
aVof something that doesn't originate from Earth.
p186
aVJansky had made a historic discovery,
p187
aVthat celestial objects could emit radio waves
p188
aVas well as light waves.
p189
aVFifty years on
p190
aVfrom Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,
p191
aVJansky's careful listening
p192
aVushered in a new age of space exploration:
p193
aVthe radio astronomy age.
p194
aVOver the next few years,
p195
aVastronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers
p196
aVand learned about our radio sky,
p197
aVabout Jupiter and the Sun,
p198
aVby listening.
p199
aa(lp200
VLet's jump ahead again.
p201
aVIt's 1964,
p202
aVand we're back at Bell Labs.
p203
aVAnd once again,
p204
aVtwo scientists have got a problem with noise.
p205
aVArno Penzias and Robert Wilson
p206
aVwere using the horn antenna
p207
aVat Bell's Holmdel laboratory
p208
aVto study the Milky Way
p209
aVwith extraordinary precision.
p210
aVThey were really listening
p211
aVto the galaxy in high fidelity.
p212
aVThere was a glitch in their soundtrack.
p213
aVA mysterious persistent noise
p214
aVwas disrupting their research.
p215
aVIt was in the microwave range,
p216
aVand it appeared to be coming
p217
aVfrom all directions simultaneously.
p218
aVNow this didn't make any sense,
p219
aVand like any reasonable engineer or scientist,
p220
aVthey assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,
p221
aVit must be the dish.
p222
aVThere were pigeons roosting in the dish.
p223
aVAnd so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,
p224
aVget the disk kind of operational again,
p225
aVnormal operations would resume.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut the noise didn't disappear.
p228
aVThe mysterious noise
p229
aVthat Penzias and Wilson were listening to
p230
aVturned out to be the oldest and most significant sound
p231
aVthat anyone had ever heard.
p232
aVIt was cosmic radiation
p233
aVleft over from the very birth of the universe.
p234
aVThis was the first experimental evidence
p235
aVthat the Big Bang existed
p236
aVand the universe was born at a precise moment
p237
aVsome 14.7 billion years ago.
p238
aVSo our story ends
p239
aVat the beginning \u2014
p240
aVthe beginning of all things, the Big Bang.
p241
aVThis is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard \u2014
p242
aVthe oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,
p243
aVthe cosmic microwave background radiation
p244
aVleft over from the Big Bang.
