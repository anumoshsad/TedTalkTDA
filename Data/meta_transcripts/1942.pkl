VThis is a vending machine in Los Angeles.
p4
aVIt's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs.
p5
aVIt's a caviar-vending machine.
p6
aa(lp7
VThis is the Art-o-mat, an art-vending machine
p8
aVthat sells small artistic creations by different artists,
p9
aVusually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is Oliver Medvedik.
p12
aVHe is not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace,
p13
aVa community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,
p14
aVwhere anybody can go and take classes
p15
aVand learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark
p16
aVor learn how to take strawberry DNA.
p17
aVIn fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions
p18
aVabout a year ago, and this is what led me into this bizarre path
p19
aVthat I'm going to talk to you right now.
p20
aVStrawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful.
p21
aVI'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before,
p22
aVbefore I saw it in this form.
p23
aVA lot of people, especially in the art community,
p24
aVdon't necessarily engage in science in this way.
p25
aVI instantly joined Genspace after this,
p26
aVand asked Oliver, "If we can do this with strawberries,
p27
aVcan we do this with people?"
p28
aVAbout 10 minutes later, we were both spitting in vials,
p29
aVcoming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction.
p30
aVI started doing this on my own.
p31
aVThis is what my DNA actually looks like.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I was at a dinner party with some artist friends,
p34
aVand I was telling them about this project,
p35
aVand they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA.
p36
aVSo I said, all right, let's get out some supplies right now.
p37
aVAnd I started having these bizarre dinner parties on Friday nights,
p38
aVwhere people would come over and we'd do DNA extractions,
p39
aVand I would capture them on video,
p40
aVbecause it created this kind of funny portrait as well.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VThese are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science.
p45
aVYou can kind of tell from their reactions.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut they became fascinated by it,
p50
aVand it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd so I started doing this regularly.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VIt's an odd thing to do with your Friday nights,
p57
aVbut this is what I started doing.
p58
aVI started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials
p59
aVand categorizing them.
p60
aVThis is what that looked like.
p61
aVAnd it started to make me think about a couple of things.
p62
aVFirst, this looked a lot like my Facebook wall.
p63
aVSo in a way, I created sort of a genetic social network.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd the second thing was,
p66
aVone time a friend came over and looked at this on my table
p67
aVand was like,  "Uh ... why are they numbered?
p68
aVIs this person more rare than the other one?"
p69
aVAnd I hadn't even thought about that.
p70
aVThey were just numbered
p71
aVbecause that was the order that I extracted the DNA in.
p72
aVBut that made me think about collecting toys,
p73
aVand what's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys,
p74
aVand being able to collect these rare toys.
p75
aVYou buy these boxes, but aren't sure what's going to be inside.
p76
aVBut when you open them, you have different rarities of the toys.
p77
aVI thought that was interesting; I thought about this
p78
aVand the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together.
p79
aVAnd for some reason, I was one night drawing a vending machine,
p80
aVthinking of doing paintings of a vending machine.
p81
aVThe vial of my DNA was sitting there,
p82
aVand I saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA
p83
aVand the coils of a vending machine.
p84
aVSo I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine.
p85
aVHere it is.

V[Each sample comes packaged
p100

VGabriel Barcia-Colombo:
p110
aVThe DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple of galleries in New York,
p111
aVand it's selling out pretty well.
p112
aVWe're in the first edition of 100 pieces,
p113
aVhoping to do another edition pretty soon.
p114
aVI'd like to get it into more of a metro hub,
p115
aVlike Grand Central or Penn Station,
p116
aVnext to some of the other vending machines in that location.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut really, with this and a lot of my art projects,
p119
aVI want to ask the audience a question:
p120
aVWhen biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting
p121
aVor 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine,
p122
aVwill you submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine?
p123
aVHow much will these samples be worth?
p124
aVWill you buy someone else's sample?
p125
aVAnd what will you be able to do with that sample?
p126
aa(lp127
VThank you.
