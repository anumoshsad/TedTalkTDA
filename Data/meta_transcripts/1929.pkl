VThirteen years ago,
p4
aVwe set ourselves a goal to end poverty.
p5
aVAfter some success,
p6
aVwe've hit a big hurdle.
p7
aVThe aftermath of the financial crisis
p8
aVhas begun to hit aid payments,
p9
aVwhich have fallen for two consecutive years.
p10
aVMy question is whether the lessons learned
p11
aVfrom saving the financial system
p12
aVcan be used to help us overcome that hurdle
p13
aVand help millions.
p14
aVCan we simply print money for aid?
p15
aa(lp16
V"Surely not."
p17
aVIt's a common reaction.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVIt's a quick talk.
p20
aVOthers channel John McEnroe.
p21
aV"You cannot be serious!"
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,
p24
aVthanks to these two children,
p25
aVwho, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart
p26
aVof my talk.
p27
aVOn the left, we have Pia.
p28
aVShe lives in England.
p29
aVShe has two loving parents,
p30
aVone of whom is standing right here.
p31
aVDorothy, on the right,
p32
aVlives in rural Kenya.
p33
aVShe's one of 13,000 orphans
p34
aVand vulnerable children
p35
aVwho are assisted by a charity that I support.
p36
aVI do that because I believe
p37
aVthat Dorothy, like Pia,
p38
aVdeserves the best life chances
p39
aVthat we can afford to give her.
p40
aVYou'll all agree with me, I'm sure.
p41
aVThe U.N. agrees too.
p42
aVTheir overriding aim
p43
aVfor international aid
p44
aVis to strive for a life of dignity for all.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut \u2014 and here's that hurdle \u2014
p47
aVcan we afford our aid aspirations?
p48
aVHistory suggests not.
p49
aVIn 1970, governments set themselves a target
p50
aVto increase overseas aid payments
p51
aVto 0.7 percent
p52
aVof their national income.
p53
aVAs you can see, a big gap opens up
p54
aVbetween actual aid and that target.
p55
aVBut then come the Millennium Development Goals,
p56
aVeight ambitious targets
p57
aVto be met by 2015.
p58
aVIf I tell you that just one of those targets
p59
aVis to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,
p60
aVyou get a sense of the ambition.
p61
aVThere's also been some success.
p62
aVThe number of people living
p63
aVon less than $1.25 a day has halved.
p64
aVBut a lot remains to be done in two years.
p65
aVOne in eight remain hungry.
p66
aVIn the context of this auditorium,
p67
aVthe front two rows aren't going to get any food.
p68
aVWe can't settle for that,
p69
aVwhich is why the concern about the eighth goal,
p70
aVwhich relates to funding,
p71
aVwhich I said at the beginning is falling,
p72
aVis so troubling.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo what can be done?
p75
aVWell, I work in financial markets,
p76
aVnot development.
p77
aVI study the behavior of investors,
p78
aVhow they react to policy and the economy.
p79
aVIt gives me a different angle on the aid issue.
p80
aVBut it took an innocent question
p81
aVfrom my then-four-year-old daughter
p82
aVto make me appreciate that.
p83
aa(lp84
VPia and I were on the way to a local cafe
p85
aVand we passed a man collecting for charity.
p86
aVI didn't have any change to give him,
p87
aVand she was disappointed.
p88
aVOnce in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book
p89
aVand starts scribbling.
p90
aVAfter a little while, I ask her what she's doing,
p91
aVand she shows me a drawing
p92
aVof a £5 note
p93
aVto give to the man outside.
p94
aVIt's so sweet,
p95
aVand more generous than Dad would have been.
p96
aVBut of course I explained to her,
p97
aV"You can't do that; it's not allowed."
p98
aVTo which I get the classic four-year-old response:
p99
aV"Why not?"
p100
aVNow I'm excited, because I actually think
p101
aVI can answer this time.
p102
aVSo I launch into an explanation of how
p103
aVan unlimited supply of money
p104
aVchasing a limited number of goods
p105
aVsends prices to the moon.
p106
aa(lp107
VSomething about that exchange stuck with me,
p108
aVnot because of the look of relief
p109
aVon Pia's face when I finally finished,
p110
aVbut because it related
p111
aVto the sanctity of the money supply,
p112
aVa sanctity that had been challenged and questioned
p113
aVby the reaction of central banks
p114
aVto the financial crisis.
p115
aVTo reassure investors,
p116
aVcentral banks began buying assets
p117
aVto try and encourage investors to do the same.
p118
aVThey funded these purchases
p119
aVwith money they created themselves.
p120
aVThe money wasn't actually physically printed.
p121
aVIt's still sort of locked away in the banking system today.
p122
aVBut the amount created was unprecedented.
p123
aVTogether, the central banks of the U.S.,
p124
aVU.K and Japan
p125
aVincreased the stock of money in their economies
p126
aVby 3.7 trillion dollars.
p127
aVThat's three times, in fact that's more than three times,
p128
aVthe total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.
p129
aVThree times!
p130
aa(lp131
VBefore the crisis,
p132
aVthis would have been utterly unthinkable,
p133
aVyet it was accepted remarkably quickly.
p134
aVThe price of gold,
p135
aVan asset thought to protect against inflation,
p136
aVdid jump,
p137
aVbut investors bought other assets
p138
aVthat offered little protection from inflation.
p139
aVThey bought fixed income securities, bonds.
p140
aVThey bought equities too.
p141
aVFor all the scare stories,
p142
aVthe actual actions of investors
p143
aVspoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.
p144
aa(lp145
VThat confidence was based on two pillars.
p146
aVThe first was that, after years
p147
aVof keeping inflation under control,
p148
aVcentral banks were trusted
p149
aVto take the money-printing away
p150
aVif inflation became a threat.
p151
aVSecondly, inflation simply never became a threat.
p152
aVAs you can see, in the United States,
p153
aVinflation for most of this period
p154
aVremained below average.
p155
aVIt was the same elsewhere.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo how does all this relate to aid?
p158
aVWell, this is where Dorothy
p159
aVand the Mango Tree charity
p160
aVthat supports her comes in.
p161
aVI was at one of their fundraising events
p162
aVearlier this year,
p163
aVand I was inspired to give a one-off donation
p164
aVwhen I remembered that my firm
p165
aVoffers to match the charitable contributions
p166
aVits employees make.
p167
aVSo think of this:
p168
aVInstead of just being able to help Dorothy
p169
aVand four of her classmates
p170
aVto go through secondary school for a few years,
p171
aVI was able to double my contribution.
p172
aVBrilliant.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo following that conversation with my daughter,
p175
aVand seeing the absence of inflation
p176
aVin the face of money-printing,
p177
aVand knowing that international aid payments
p178
aVwere falling at just the wrong time,
p179
aVthis made me wonder:
p180
aVCould we match
p181
aVbut just on a much grander scale?
p182
aVLet's call this scheme "Print Aid."
p183
aVAnd here's how it might work.
p184
aVProvided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,
p185
aVthe central bank would be mandated
p186
aVto match the government's overseas aid payments
p187
aVup to a certain limit.
p188
aVGovernments have been aiming to get aid
p189
aVto 0.7 percent for years,
p190
aVso let's set the limit at half of that,
p191
aV0.35 percent of their income.
p192
aVSo it would work like this: If in a given year
p193
aVthe government gave 0.2 percent of its income
p194
aVto overseas aid,
p195
aVthe central bank would simply top it up
p196
aVwith a further 0.2 percent.
p197
aVSo far so good.
p198
aa(lp199
VHow risky is this?
p200
aVWell, this involves the creation of money
p201
aVto buy goods, not assets.
p202
aVIt sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.
p203
aVBut there are two important mitigating factors here.
p204
aVThe first is that by definition,
p205
aVthis money printed would be spent overseas.
p206
aVSo it's not obvious how it leads to inflation
p207
aVin the country doing the actual printing
p208
aVunless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country.
p209
aVThat is unlikely for the second reason:
p210
aVthe scale of the money that would be printed
p211
aVunder this scheme.
p212
aVSo let's think of an example
p213
aVwhere Print Aid was in place
p214
aVin the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
p215
aVTo match the aid payments made
p216
aVby those governments over the last four years,
p217
aVPrint Aid would have generated
p218
aV200 billion dollars' worth of extra aid.
p219
aVWhat would that look like
p220
aVin the context of the increase in the money stock
p221
aVthat had already happened in those countries
p222
aVto save the financial system?
p223
aVAre you read for this?
p224
aVYou might struggle to see that at the back,
p225
aVbecause the gap is quite small.
p226
aVSo what we're saying here
p227
aVis that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble
p228
aVto save our financial systems,
p229
aVand you know what, it paid off.
p230
aVThere was no inflation.
p231
aVAre we really saying that it's not worth the risk
p232
aVto print an extra 200 billion for aid?
p233
aVWould the risks really be that different?
p234
aVTo me, it's not that clear.
p235
aVWhat is clear is the impact on aid.
p236
aVEven though this is the printing
p237
aVof just three central banks,
p238
aVthe global aid that's given
p239
aVover this period is up by almost 40 percent.
p240
aVAid as a proportion of national income
p241
aVall of a sudden is at a 40-year high.
p242
aVNow, we don't get to 0.7 percent.
p243
aVGovernments are still incentivized to give.
p244
aVBut you know what, that's the  point of a matching scheme.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo I think what we've learned
p247
aVis that the risks from this money creation scheme
p248
aVare quite modest,
p249
aVbut the benefits
p250
aVare potentially huge.
p251
aVImagine what we could do with 40 percent more funding.
p252
aVWe might be able to feed the front row.
p253
aa(lp254
VThe thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,
p255
aVapart from the fact that I've run out of time,
p256
aVis that the window of opportunity for this idea
p257
aVis a short one.
p258
aVToday, money creation by central banks
p259
aVis an accepted policy tool.
p260
aVThat may not always be the case.
p261
aVToday there are universally agreed aims
p262
aVfor international aid.
p263
aVThat may not always be the case.
p264
aVToday might be the only time
p265
aVthat these two things coincide,
p266
aVsuch that we can afford the aid
p267
aVthat we've always aspired to give.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo, can we print money for international aid?
p270
aVI seriously believe the question should be,
p271
aVwhy not?
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you very much.
