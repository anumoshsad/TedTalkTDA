VWhen I was 27 years old,
p4
aVI left a very demanding job in management consulting
p5
aVfor a job that was even more demanding: teaching.
p6
aVI went to teach seventh graders math
p7
aVin the New York City public schools.
p8
aVAnd like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests.
p9
aVI gave out homework assignments.
p10
aVWhen the work came back, I calculated grades.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat struck me was that IQ was not the only difference
p13
aVbetween my best and my worst students.
p14
aVSome of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.
p15
aVSome of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
p16
aVAnd that got me thinking.
p17
aVThe kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math,
p18
aVsure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.
p19
aVBut these concepts are not impossible,
p20
aVand I was firmly convinced that every one of my students
p21
aVcould learn the material
p22
aVif they worked hard and long enough.
p23
aa(lp24
VAfter several more years of teaching,
p25
aVI came to the conclusion that what we need in education
p26
aVis a much better understanding of students and learning
p27
aVfrom a motivational perspective,
p28
aVfrom a psychological perspective.
p29
aVIn education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.
p30
aVBut what if doing well in school and in life
p31
aVdepends on much more
p32
aVthan your ability to learn quickly and easily?
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I left the classroom,
p35
aVand I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.
p36
aVI started studying kids and adults
p37
aVin all kinds of super challenging settings,
p38
aVand in every study my question was,
p39
aVwho is successful here and why?
p40
aVMy research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.
p41
aVWe tried to predict which cadets
p42
aVwould stay in military training and which would drop out.
p43
aVWe went to the National Spelling Bee
p44
aVand tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition.
p45
aVWe studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods,
p46
aVasking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching
p47
aVby the end of the school year,
p48
aVand of those, who will be the most effective
p49
aVat improving learning outcomes for their students?
p50
aVWe partnered with private companies, asking,
p51
aVwhich of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs?
p52
aVAnd who's going to earn the most money?
p53
aVIn all those very different contexts,
p54
aVone characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success.
p55
aVAnd it wasn't social intelligence.
p56
aVIt wasn't good looks, physical health,
p57
aVand it wasn't IQ.
p58
aVIt was grit.
p59
aa(lp60
VGrit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
p61
aVGrit is having stamina.
p62
aVGrit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,
p63
aVnot just for the week, not just for the month,
p64
aVbut for years,
p65
aVand working really hard to make that future a reality.
p66
aVGrit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
p67
aa(lp68
VA few years ago,
p69
aVI started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.
p70
aVI asked thousands of high school juniors
p71
aVto take grit questionnaires,
p72
aVand then waited around more than a year
p73
aVto see who would graduate.
p74
aVTurns out that grittier kids
p75
aVwere significantly more likely to graduate,
p76
aVeven when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure,
p77
aVthings like family income,
p78
aVstandardized achievement test scores,
p79
aVeven how safe kids felt when they were at school.
p80
aVSo it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee
p81
aVthat grit matters.
p82
aVIt's also in school,
p83
aVespecially for kids at risk for dropping out.
p84
aa(lp85
VTo me, the most shocking thing about grit
p86
aVis how little we know,
p87
aVhow little science knows, about building it.
p88
aVEvery day, parents and teachers ask me,
p89
aV"How do I build grit in kids?
p90
aVWhat do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?
p91
aVHow do I keep them motivated for the long run?"
p92
aVThe honest answer is,
p93
aVI don't know.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.
p98
aVOur data show very clearly
p99
aVthat there are many talented individuals
p100
aVwho simply do not follow through on their commitments.
p101
aVIn fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated
p102
aVor even inversely related to measures of talent.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids
p105
aVis something called "growth mindset."
p106
aVThis is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,
p107
aVand it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,
p108
aVthat it can change with your effort.
p109
aVDr. Dweck has shown
p110
aVthat when kids read and learn about the brain
p111
aVand how it changes and grows in response to challenge,
p112
aVthey're much more likely to persevere when they fail,
p113
aVbecause they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
p116
aVBut we need more.
p117
aVAnd that's where I'm going to end my remarks,
p118
aVbecause that's where we are.
p119
aVThat's the work that stands before us.
p120
aVWe need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions,
p121
aVand we need to test them.
p122
aVWe need to measure whether we've been successful,
p123
aVand we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong,
p124
aVto start over again with lessons learned.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn other words, we need to be gritty
p127
aVabout getting our kids grittier.
p128
aa(lp129
VThank you.
