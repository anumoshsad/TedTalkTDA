VElection night 2008
p4
aVwas a night that tore me in half.
p5
aVIt was the night that Barack Obama was elected.
p6
aV[One hundred and forty-three]  years after the end of slavery,
p7
aVand [43] years after the passage
p8
aVof the Voting Rights Act,
p9
aVan African-American was elected president.
p10
aVMany of us never thought that this was possible
p11
aVuntil the moment that it happened.
p12
aVAnd in many ways, it was the climax
p13
aVof the black civil rights movement
p14
aVin the United States.
p15
aa(lp16
VI was in California that night,
p17
aVwhich was ground zero at the time
p18
aVfor another movement:
p19
aVthe marriage equality movement.
p20
aVGay marriage was on the ballot
p21
aVin the form of Proposition 8,
p22
aVand as the election returns started to come in,
p23
aVit became clear that the right
p24
aVfor same sex couples to marry,
p25
aVwhich had recently been granted by the California courts,
p26
aVwas going to be taken away.
p27
aVSo on the same night
p28
aVthat Barack Obama won his historic presidency,
p29
aVthe lesbian and gay community suffered
p30
aVone of our most painful defeats.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd then it got even worse.
p33
aVPretty much immediately,
p34
aVAfrican-Americans started to be blamed
p35
aVfor the passage of Proposition 8.
p36
aVThis was largely due to an incorrect poll that said
p37
aVthat blacks had voted for the measure
p38
aVby something like 70 percent.
p39
aVThis turned out not to be true,
p40
aVbut this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,
p41
aVand was grabbed on by the media.
p42
aVI couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.
p43
aVI listened to some gay commentator say
p44
aVthat the African-American community
p45
aVwas notoriously homophobic,
p46
aVand now that civil rights had been achieved for us,
p47
aVwe wanted to take away other people's rights.
p48
aVThere were even reports of racist epithets
p49
aVbeing thrown at some of the participants
p50
aVof the gay rights rallies
p51
aVthat took place after the election.
p52
aVAnd on the other side,
p53
aVsome African-Americans dismissed or ignored
p54
aVhomophobia that was indeed real in our community.
p55
aVAnd others resented this comparison
p56
aVbetween gay rights and civil rights,
p57
aVand once again, the sinking feeling
p58
aVthat two minority groups
p59
aVof which I'm both a part of
p60
aVwere competing with each other
p61
aVinstead of supporting each other
p62
aVoverwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, I'm a documentary filmmaker,
p65
aVso after going through my pissed off stage
p66
aVand yelling at the television and radio,
p67
aVmy next instinct was
p68
aVto make a movie.
p69
aVAnd what guided me in making this film was,
p70
aVhow was this happening?
p71
aVHow was it that the gay rights movement
p72
aVwas being pitted against the civil rights movement?
p73
aVAnd this wasn't just an abstract question.
p74
aVI'm a beneficiary of both movements,
p75
aVso this was actually personal.
p76
aVBut then something else happened
p77
aVafter that election in 2008.
p78
aVThe march towards gay equality
p79
aVaccelerated at a pace
p80
aVthat surprised and shocked everyone,
p81
aVand is still reshaping our laws and our policies,
p82
aVour institutions and our entire country.
p83
aVAnd so it started to become increasingly clear to me
p84
aVthat this pitting of the two movements
p85
aVagainst each other actually didn't make sense,
p86
aVand that they were in fact
p87
aVmuch, much more interconnected,
p88
aVand that, in fact, some of the way
p89
aVthat the gay rights movement has been able
p90
aVto make such incredible gains so quickly
p91
aVis that it's used some of the same tactics
p92
aVand strategies that were first laid down
p93
aVby the civil rights movement.
p94
aVLet's just look at a few of these strategies.
p95
aa(lp96
VFirst off, it's really interesting to see,
p97
aVto actually visually see, how quick
p98
aVthe gay rights movement has made its gains,
p99
aVif you look at a few of the major events
p100
aVon a timeline of both freedom movements.
p101
aVNow, there are tons of milestones
p102
aVin the civil rights movement,
p103
aVbut the first one we're going to start with
p104
aVis the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.
p105
aVThis was a protest campaign
p106
aVagainst Montgomery, Alabama's segregation
p107
aVon their public transit system,
p108
aVand it began when a woman named Rosa Parks
p109
aVrefused to give up her seat to a white person.
p110
aVThe campaign lasted a year,
p111
aVand it galvanized the civil rights movement
p112
aVlike nothing had before it.
p113
aVAnd I call this strategy the
p114
aV"I'm tired of your foot on my neck" strategy.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo gays and lesbians have been in society
p117
aVsince societies began,
p118
aVbut up until the mid-20th century,
p119
aVhomosexual acts were still illegal in most states.
p120
aVSo just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,
p121
aVa group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.
p122
aVIt's known as Stonewall, in 1969,
p123
aVand it's where a group of LGBT patrons
p124
aVfought back against police beatings
p125
aVat a Greenwich Village bar that sparked
p126
aVthree days of rioting.
p127
aVIncidentally, black and latino LGBT folks
p128
aVwere at the forefront of this rebellion,
p129
aVand it's a really interesting example
p130
aVof the intersection of our struggles against racism,
p131
aVhomophobia, gender identity and police brutality.
p132
aVAfter Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups
p133
aVsprang up all over the country,
p134
aVand the modern gay rights  movement as we know it took off.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo the next moment to look at on the timeline
p137
aVis the 1963 March on Washington.
p138
aVThis was a seminal event in the civil rights movement
p139
aVand it's where African-Americans called for both
p140
aVcivil and economic justice.
p141
aVAnd it's of course where Martin Luther King
p142
aVdelivered his famous "I have a dream" speech,
p143
aVbut what's actually less known
p144
aVis that this march was organized
p145
aVby a man named Bayard Rustin.
p146
aVBayard was an out gay man,
p147
aVand he's considered one of the most brilliant
p148
aVstrategists of the civil rights movement.
p149
aVHe later in his life became a fierce advocate
p150
aVof LGBT rights as well, and his life
p151
aVis testament to the intersection of the struggles.
p152
aVThe March on Washington
p153
aVis one of the high points of the movement,
p154
aVand it's where there was a fervent belief
p155
aVthat African-Americans too
p156
aVcould be a part of American democracy.
p157
aVI call this strategy the
p158
aV"We are visible and many in numbers" strategy.
p159
aa(lp160
VSome early gay activists were actually
p161
aVdirectly inspired by the march,
p162
aVand some had taken part.
p163
aVGay pioneer Jack Nichols said,
p164
aV"We marched with Martin Luther King,
p165
aVseven of us from the Mattachine Society" \u2014
p166
aVwhich was an early gay rights organization \u2014
p167
aV"and from that moment on, we had our own dream
p168
aVabout a gay rights march of similar proportions."
p169
aVSeveral years later, a series of marches took place,
p170
aVeach one gaining the momentum
p171
aVof the gay freedom struggle.
p172
aVThe first one was in 1979,
p173
aVand the second one took place in 1987.
p174
aVThe third one was held in 1993.
p175
aVAlmost a million people showed up,
p176
aVand people were so energized and excited
p177
aVby what had taken place,
p178
aVthey went back to their own communities
p179
aVand started their own political
p180
aVand social organizations,
p181
aVfurther increasing the visibility of the movement.
p182
aVThe day of that march, October 11,
p183
aVwas then declared National Coming Out Day,
p184
aVand is still celebrated all over the world.
p185
aVThese marches set the groundwork
p186
aVfor the historic changes that we see happening
p187
aVtoday in the United States.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd lastly, the "Loving" strategy.
p190
aVThe name speaks for itself.
p191
aVIn 1967, the Supreme Court ruled
p192
aVin Loving v. Virginia,
p193
aVand invalidated all laws
p194
aVthat prohibited interracial marriage.
p195
aVThis is considered one of the Supreme Court's
p196
aVlandmark civil rights cases.
p197
aVIn 1996, President Clinton signed
p198
aVthe Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,
p199
aVand that made the federal government
p200
aVonly have to recognize marriages
p201
aVbetween a man and a woman.
p202
aVIn United States v. Windsor,
p203
aVa 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor
p204
aVsued the federal government
p205
aVwhen she was forced to pay estate taxes
p206
aVon her deceased wife's property,
p207
aVsomething that heterosexual  couples don't have to do.
p208
aVAnd as the case wound its way
p209
aVthrough the lower courts,
p210
aVthe Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.
p211
aVWhen it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,
p212
aVthe Supreme Court agreed,
p213
aVand DOMA was thrown out.
p214
aVIt was incredible.
p215
aVBut the gay marriage movement
p216
aVhas been making gains for years now.
p217
aVTo date, 17 states
p218
aVhave passed laws allowing marriage equality.
p219
aVIt's become the de facto battle
p220
aVfor gay equality,
p221
aVand it seems like daily,
p222
aVlaws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,
p223
aVeven in places like Texas and Utah,
p224
aVwhich no one saw coming.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo a lot has changed
p227
aVsince that night in 2008
p228
aVwhen I felt torn in half.
p229
aVI did go on to make that film.
p230
aVIt's a documentary film,
p231
aVand it's called "The New Black,"
p232
aVand it looks at how the African-American community
p233
aVis grappling with the gay rights issue
p234
aVin light of the gay marriage movement
p235
aVand this fight over the meaning of civil rights.
p236
aVAnd I wanted to capture
p237
aVsome of this incredible change that was happening,
p238
aVand as luck or politics would have it,
p239
aVanother marriage battle started gearing up,
p240
aVthis time in Maryland,
p241
aVwhere African-Americans make up 30 percent
p242
aVof the electorate.
p243
aVSo this tension between gay rights
p244
aVand civil rights started to bubble up once again,
p245
aVand I was lucky enough to capture
p246
aVhow some people were making the connection
p247
aVbetween the movements this time.
p248
aVThis is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes
p249
aVand Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,
p250
aVas they hit the streets of Baltimore
p251
aVand try to convince potential voters.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up, man, this is a righteous man over here.
p254
aVOkay, are you registered to vote?
p255
aa(lp256
VMan: No. Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?
p257
aa(lp258
VMan: 21. KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe got to get you registered to vote.
p261
aa(lp262
VMan: I ain't voting on no gay shit.
p263
aa(lp264
VSM: Okay, why? What's up? Man: I ain't with that.
p265
aa(lp266
VSM: That's not cool.
p267
aa(lp268
VMan: What made you be gay? SM: So what made you be straight?
p269
aa(lp270
VSo what made you be straight?
p271
aVMan 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VKSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,
p274
aVbut I know that because a black man like yourself
p275
aVstood up for a woman like me,
p276
aVI know that I've got the same opportunities.
p277
aVSo you, as a black man, have the opportunity
p278
aVto stand up for somebody else.
p279
aVWhether you're gay or not,
p280
aVthese are your brothers and sisters out here,
p281
aVand they need you to represent.
p282
aa(lp283
VMan 2: Who is you to tell somebody
p284
aVwho they can't have sex with,
p285
aVwho they can't be with?
p286
aVThey ain't got that power.
p287
aVNobody has that power to say, you can't marry that young lady.
p288
aVWho has that power? Nobody.
p289
aa(lp290
VSM: But you know what?
p291
aVOur state has put the power in your hands,
p292
aVand so what we need you to do
p293
aVis vote for, you gonna vote for 6.
p294
aa(lp295
VMan 2: I got you.
p296
aa(lp297
VSM: Vote for 6, okay? Man 2: I got you.
p298
aa(lp299
VKSM: All right, do y'all need community service hours?
p300
aVYou do? All right, you can always volunteer with us
p301
aVto get community service hours.
p302
aVY'all want to do that?
p303
aVWe feed you. We bring you pizza.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VYoruba Richen: Thank you.
p308
aVWhat's amazing to me about that clip
p309
aVthat we just captured as we were filming
p310
aVis, it really shows how Karess
p311
aVunderstands the history of the civil rights movement,
p312
aVbut she's not restricted by it.
p313
aVShe doesn't just limit it to black people.
p314
aVShe sees it as a blueprint
p315
aVfor expanding rights to gays and lesbians.
p316
aVMaybe because she's younger, she's like 25,
p317
aVshe's able to do this a little bit more easily,
p318
aVbut the fact is that Maryland voters
p319
aVdid pass that marriage equality amendment,
p320
aVand in fact it was the first time
p321
aVthat marriage equality was directly voted on
p322
aVand passed by the voters.
p323
aVAfrican-Americans supported it at a higher level
p324
aVthan had ever been recorded.
p325
aVIt was a complete turnaround from that night
p326
aVin 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.
p327
aVIt was, and feels, monumental.
p328
aVWe in the LGBT community have gone
p329
aVfrom being a pathologized and reviled
p330
aVand criminalized group
p331
aVto being seen as part of the great human quest
p332
aVfor dignity and equality.
p333
aVWe've gone from having to hide our sexuality
p334
aVin order to maintain our jobs and our families
p335
aVto literally getting a place at the table
p336
aVwith the president
p337
aVand a shout out at his second inauguration.
p338
aVI just want to read what he said
p339
aVat that inauguration:
p340
aV"We the people declare today
p341
aVthat the most evident of truths,
p342
aVthat all of us are created equal.
p343
aVIt is the star that guides us still,
p344
aVjust as it guided our forebears
p345
aVthrough Seneca Falls
p346
aVand Selma and Stonewall."
p347
aa(lp348
VNow we know that everything is not perfect,
p349
aVespecially when you look at what's happening
p350
aVwith the LGBT rights issue internationally,
p351
aVbut it says something about how far we've come
p352
aVwhen our president puts the gay freedom struggle
p353
aVin the context of the other great freedom struggles
p354
aVof our time: the women's rights movement
p355
aVand the civil rights movement.
p356
aVHis statement demonstrates not only
p357
aVthe interconnectedness of those movements,
p358
aVbut how each one borrowed
p359
aVand was inspired by the other.
p360
aVSo just as Martin Luther King
p361
aVlearned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics
p362
aVof civil disobedience and nonviolence,
p363
aVwhich became a bedrock of the civil rights movement,
p364
aVthe gay rights movement saw what worked
p365
aVin the civil rights movement,
p366
aVand they used some of those same strategies
p367
aVand tactics to make gains
p368
aVat an even quicker pace.
p369
aa(lp370
VMaybe one more other reason
p371
aVfor the relative quick progress
p372
aVof the gay rights movement.
p373
aVWhereas a lot of us continue to still live
p374
aVin racially segregated spaces,
p375
aVLGBT folks, we are everywhere.
p376
aVWe are in urban communities
p377
aVand rural communities,
p378
aVcommunities of color, immigrant communities,
p379
aVchurches and mosques and synagogues.
p380
aVWe are your mothers and brothers
p381
aVand sisters and sons.
p382
aVAnd when someone that you love
p383
aVor a family member comes out,
p384
aVit may be easier to support their quest for equality.
p385
aVAnd in fact, the gay rights movement
p386
aVasks us to support justice and equality
p387
aVfrom a space of love.
p388
aVThat may be the biggest, greatest gift
p389
aVthat the movement has given us.
p390
aVIt calls on us to access that which is most universal
p391
aVand most intimate:
p392
aVa love of our brother and our sister
p393
aVand our neighbor.
p394
aVI just want to end with a quote
p395
aVby one of our greatest freedom fighters
p396
aVwho's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela
p397
aVof South Africa.
p398
aVNelson Mandela led South Africa
p399
aVafter the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,
p400
aVand out of the ashes of that  legalized racial discrimination,
p401
aVhe led South Africa to become the first country
p402
aVin the world to ban discrimination
p403
aVbased on sexual orientation within its constitution.
p404
aVMandela said,
p405
aV"For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,
p406
aVbut to live in a way that respects
p407
aVand enhances the freedom of others."
p408
aa(lp409
VSo as these movements continue on,
p410
aVand as freedom struggles around the world continue on,
p411
aVlet's remember that not only are they interconnected,
p412
aVbut they must support and enhance each other
p413
aVfor us to be truly victorious.
p414
aa(lp415
VThank you.
