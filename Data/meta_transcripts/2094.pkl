VAmerica's favorite pie is?
p4
aa(lp5
VAudience: Apple. Kenneth Cukier: Apple. Of course it is.
p6
aVHow do we know it?
p7
aVBecause of data.
p8
aVYou look at supermarket sales.
p9
aVYou look at supermarket sales of 30-centimeter pies
p10
aVthat are frozen, and apple wins, no contest.
p11
aVThe majority of the sales are apple.
p12
aVBut then supermarkets started selling
p13
aVsmaller, 11-centimeter pies,
p14
aVand suddenly, apple fell to fourth or fifth place.
p15
aVWhy? What happened?
p16
aVOkay, think about it.
p17
aVWhen you buy a 30-centimeter pie,
p18
aVthe whole family has to agree,
p19
aVand apple is everyone's second favorite.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVBut when you buy an individual 11-centimeter pie,
p22
aVyou can buy the one that you want.
p23
aVYou can get your first choice.
p24
aVYou have more data.
p25
aVYou can see something
p26
aVthat you couldn't see
p27
aVwhen you only had smaller amounts of it.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, the point here is that more data
p30
aVdoesn't just let us see more,
p31
aVmore of the same thing we were looking at.
p32
aVMore data allows us to see new.
p33
aVIt allows us to see better.
p34
aVIt allows us to see different.
p35
aVIn this case, it allows us to see
p36
aVwhat America's favorite pie is:
p37
aVnot apple.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, you probably all have heard the term big data.
p40
aVIn fact, you're probably sick of hearing the term
p41
aVbig data.
p42
aVIt is true that there is a lot of hype around the term,
p43
aVand that is very unfortunate,
p44
aVbecause big data is an extremely important tool
p45
aVby which society is going to advance.
p46
aVIn the past, we used to look at small data
p47
aVand think about what it would mean
p48
aVto try to understand the world,
p49
aVand now we have a lot more of it,
p50
aVmore than we ever could before.
p51
aVWhat we find is that when we have
p52
aVa large body of data, we can fundamentally do things
p53
aVthat we couldn't do when we only had smaller amounts.
p54
aVBig data is important, and big data is new,
p55
aVand when you think about it,
p56
aVthe only way this planet is going to deal
p57
aVwith its global challenges \u2014
p58
aVto feed people, supply them with medical care,
p59
aVsupply them with energy, electricity,
p60
aVand to make sure they're not burnt to a crisp
p61
aVbecause of global warming \u2014
p62
aVis because of the effective use of data.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what is new about big  data? What is the big deal?
p65
aVWell, to answer that question, let's think about
p66
aVwhat information looked like,
p67
aVphysically looked like in the past.
p68
aVIn 1908, on the island of Crete,
p69
aVarchaeologists discovered a clay disc.
p70
aVThey dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old.
p71
aVNow, there's inscriptions on this disc,
p72
aVbut we actually don't know what it means.
p73
aVIt's a complete mystery, but the point is that
p74
aVthis is what information used to look like
p75
aV4,000 years ago.
p76
aVThis is how society stored
p77
aVand transmitted information.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, society hasn't advanced all that much.
p80
aVWe still store information on discs,
p81
aVbut now we can store a lot more information,
p82
aVmore than ever before.
p83
aVSearching it is easier. Copying it easier.
p84
aVSharing it is easier. Processing it is easier.
p85
aVAnd what we can do is we can reuse this information
p86
aVfor uses that we never even imagined
p87
aVwhen we first collected the data.
p88
aVIn this respect, the data has gone
p89
aVfrom a stock to a flow,
p90
aVfrom something that is stationary and static
p91
aVto something that is fluid and dynamic.
p92
aVThere is, if you will, a liquidity to information.
p93
aVThe disc that was discovered off of Crete
p94
aVthat's 4,000 years old, is heavy,
p95
aVit doesn't store a lot of information,
p96
aVand that information is unchangeable.
p97
aVBy contrast, all of the files
p98
aVthat Edward Snowden took
p99
aVfrom the National Security Agency in the United States
p100
aVfits on a memory stick
p101
aVthe size of a fingernail,
p102
aVand it can be shared at the speed of light.
p103
aVMore data. More.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, one reason why we have so much data in the world today
p106
aVis we are collecting things
p107
aVthat we've always collected information on,
p108
aVbut another reason why is we're taking things
p109
aVthat have always been informational
p110
aVbut have never been rendered into a data format
p111
aVand we are putting it into data.
p112
aVThink, for example, the question of location.
p113
aVTake, for example, Martin Luther.
p114
aVIf we wanted to know in the 1500s
p115
aVwhere Martin Luther was,
p116
aVwe would have to follow him at all times,
p117
aVmaybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell,
p118
aVand record it,
p119
aVbut now think about what it looks like today.
p120
aVYou know that somewhere,
p121
aVprobably in a telecommunications carrier's database,
p122
aVthere is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry
p123
aVthat records your information
p124
aVof where you've been at all times.
p125
aVIf you have a cell phone,
p126
aVand that cell phone has GPS, but even if it doesn't have GPS,
p127
aVit can record your information.
p128
aVIn this respect, location has been datafied.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow think, for example, of the issue of posture,
p131
aVthe way that you are all sitting right now,
p132
aVthe way that you sit,
p133
aVthe way that you sit, the way that you sit.
p134
aVIt's all different, and it's a function of your leg length
p135
aVand your back and the contours of your back,
p136
aVand if I were to put sensors,  maybe 100 sensors
p137
aVinto all of your chairs right now,
p138
aVI could create an index that's fairly unique to you,
p139
aVsort of like a fingerprint, but it's not your finger.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo what could we do with this?
p142
aVResearchers in Tokyo are using it
p143
aVas a potential anti-theft device in cars.
p144
aVThe idea is that the carjacker sits behind the wheel,
p145
aVtries to stream off, but the car recognizes
p146
aVthat a non-approved driver is behind the wheel,
p147
aVand maybe the engine just stops, unless you
p148
aVtype in a password into the dashboard
p149
aVto say, "Hey, I have authorization to drive." Great.
p150
aa(lp151
VWhat if every single car in Europe
p152
aVhad this technology in it?
p153
aVWhat could we do then?
p154
aVMaybe, if we aggregated the data,
p155
aVmaybe we could identify telltale signs
p156
aVthat best predict that a car accident
p157
aVis going to take place in the next five seconds.
p158
aVAnd then what we will have datafied
p159
aVis driver fatigue,
p160
aVand the service would be when the car senses
p161
aVthat the person slumps into that position,
p162
aVautomatically knows, hey, set an internal alarm
p163
aVthat would vibrate the steering wheel, honk inside
p164
aVto say, "Hey, wake up,
p165
aVpay more attention to the road."
p166
aVThese are the sorts of things we can do
p167
aVwhen we datafy more aspects of our lives.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo what is the value of big data?
p170
aVWell, think about it.
p171
aVYou have more information.
p172
aVYou can do things that you couldn't do before.
p173
aVOne of the most impressive areas
p174
aVwhere this concept is taking place
p175
aVis in the area of machine learning.
p176
aVMachine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence,
p177
aVwhich itself is a branch of computer science.
p178
aVThe general idea is that instead of
p179
aVinstructing a computer what do do,
p180
aVwe are going to simply throw data at the problem
p181
aVand tell the computer to figure it out for itself.
p182
aVAnd it will help you understand it
p183
aVby seeing its origins.
p184
aVIn the 1950s, a computer scientist
p185
aVat IBM named Arthur Samuel liked to play checkers,
p186
aVso he wrote a computer program
p187
aVso he could play against the computer.
p188
aVHe played. He won.
p189
aVHe played. He won.
p190
aVHe played. He won,
p191
aVbecause the computer only knew
p192
aVwhat a legal move was.
p193
aVArthur Samuel knew something else.
p194
aVArthur Samuel knew strategy.
p195
aVSo he wrote a small sub-program alongside it
p196
aVoperating in the background, and all it did
p197
aVwas score the probability
p198
aVthat a given board configuration would likely lead
p199
aVto a winning board versus a losing board
p200
aVafter every move.
p201
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p202
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p203
aVHe plays the computer. He wins.
p204
aVAnd then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer
p205
aVto play itself.
p206
aVIt plays itself. It collects more data.
p207
aVIt collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction.
p208
aVAnd then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer
p209
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p210
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p211
aVand he plays it, and he loses,
p212
aVand Arthur Samuel has created a machine
p213
aVthat surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd this idea of machine learning
p216
aVis going everywhere.
p217
aVHow do you think we have self-driving cars?
p218
aVAre we any better off as a society
p219
aVenshrining all the rules of the road into software?
p220
aVNo. Memory is cheaper. No.
p221
aVAlgorithms are faster. No. Processors are better. No.
p222
aVAll of those things matter, but that's not why.
p223
aVIt's because we changed the nature of the problem.
p224
aVWe changed the nature of the problem from one
p225
aVin which we tried to overtly and explicitly
p226
aVexplain to the computer how to drive
p227
aVto one in which we say,
p228
aV"Here's a lot of data around the vehicle.
p229
aVYou figure it out.
p230
aVYou figure it out that that is a traffic light,
p231
aVthat that traffic light is red and not green,
p232
aVthat that means that you need to stop
p233
aVand not go forward."
p234
aa(lp235
VMachine learning is at the basis
p236
aVof many of the things that we do online:
p237
aVsearch engines,
p238
aVAmazon's personalization algorithm,
p239
aVcomputer translation,
p240
aVvoice recognition systems.
p241
aVResearchers recently have looked at
p242
aVthe question of biopsies,
p243
aVcancerous biopsies,
p244
aVand they've asked the computer to identify
p245
aVby looking at the data and survival rates
p246
aVto determine whether cells are actually
p247
aVcancerous or not,
p248
aVand sure enough, when you throw the data at it,
p249
aVthrough a machine-learning algorithm,
p250
aVthe machine was able to identify
p251
aVthe 12 telltale signs that best predict
p252
aVthat this biopsy of the breast cancer cells
p253
aVare indeed cancerous.
p254
aVThe problem: The medical literature
p255
aVonly knew nine of them.
p256
aVThree of the traits were ones
p257
aVthat people didn't need to look for,
p258
aVbut that the machine spotted.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, there are dark sides to big data as well.
p261
aVIt will improve our lives, but there are problems
p262
aVthat we need to be conscious of,
p263
aVand the first one is the idea
p264
aVthat we may be punished for predictions,
p265
aVthat the police may use big data for their purposes,
p266
aVa little bit like "Minority Report."
p267
aVNow, it's a term called predictive policing,
p268
aVor algorithmic criminology,
p269
aVand the idea is that if we take a lot of data,
p270
aVfor example where past crimes have been,
p271
aVwe know where to send the patrols.
p272
aVThat makes sense, but the problem, of course,
p273
aVis that it's not simply going to stop on location data,
p274
aVit's going to go down to the level of the individual.
p275
aVWhy don't we use data about the person's
p276
aVhigh school transcript?
p277
aVMaybe we should use the fact that
p278
aVthey're unemployed or not, their credit score,
p279
aVtheir web-surfing behavior,
p280
aVwhether they're up late at night.
p281
aVTheir Fitbit, when it's able to identify biochemistries,
p282
aVwill show that they have aggressive thoughts.
p283
aVWe may have algorithms that are likely to predict
p284
aVwhat we are about to do,
p285
aVand we may be held accountable
p286
aVbefore we've actually acted.
p287
aVPrivacy was the central challenge
p288
aVin a small data era.
p289
aVIn the big data age,
p290
aVthe challenge will be safeguarding free will,
p291
aVmoral choice, human volition,
p292
aVhuman agency.
p293
aa(lp294
VThere is another problem:
p295
aVBig data is going to steal our jobs.
p296
aVBig data and algorithms are going to challenge
p297
aVwhite collar, professional knowledge work
p298
aVin the 21st century
p299
aVin the same way that factory automation
p300
aVand the assembly line
p301
aVchallenged blue collar labor in the 20th century.
p302
aVThink about a lab technician
p303
aVwho is looking through a microscope
p304
aVat a cancer biopsy
p305
aVand determining whether it's cancerous or not.
p306
aVThe person went to university.
p307
aVThe person buys property.
p308
aVHe or she votes.
p309
aVHe or she is a stakeholder in society.
p310
aVAnd that person's job,
p311
aVas well as an entire fleet
p312
aVof professionals like that person,
p313
aVis going to find that their jobs are radically changed
p314
aVor actually completely eliminated.
p315
aVNow, we like to think
p316
aVthat technology creates jobs over a period of time
p317
aVafter a short, temporary period of dislocation,
p318
aVand that is true for the frame of reference
p319
aVwith which we all live, the Industrial Revolution,
p320
aVbecause that's precisely what happened.
p321
aVBut we forget something in that analysis:
p322
aVThere are some categories of jobs
p323
aVthat simply get eliminated and never come back.
p324
aVThe Industrial Revolution wasn't very good
p325
aVif you were a horse.
p326
aVSo we're going to need to be careful
p327
aVand take big data and adjust it for our needs,
p328
aVour very human needs.
p329
aVWe have to be the master of this technology,
p330
aVnot its servant.
p331
aVWe are just at the outset of the big data era,
p332
aVand honestly, we are not very good
p333
aVat handling all the data that we can now collect.
p334
aVIt's not just a problem for the National Security Agency.
p335
aVBusinesses collect lots of data, and they misuse it too,
p336
aVand we need to get better at this, and this will take time.
p337
aVIt's a little bit like the challenge that was faced
p338
aVby primitive man and fire.
p339
aVThis is a tool, but this is a tool that,
p340
aVunless we're careful, will burn us.
p341
aa(lp342
VBig data is going to transform how we live,
p343
aVhow we work and how we think.
p344
aVIt is going to help us manage our careers
p345
aVand lead lives of satisfaction and hope
p346
aVand happiness and health,
p347
aVbut in the past, we've often looked at information technology
p348
aVand our eyes have only seen the T,
p349
aVthe technology, the hardware,
p350
aVbecause that's what was physical.
p351
aVWe now need to recast our gaze at the I,
p352
aVthe information,
p353
aVwhich is less apparent,
p354
aVbut in some ways a lot more important.
p355
aVHumanity can finally learn from the information
p356
aVthat it can collect,
p357
aVas part of our timeless quest
p358
aVto understand the world and our place in it,
p359
aVand that's why big data is a big deal.
