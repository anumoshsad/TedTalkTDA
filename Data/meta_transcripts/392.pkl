VThis is a guy named Bob McKim.
p4
aVHe was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,
p5
aVand also led the Stanford Design Program.
p6
aVAnd in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,
p7
aVwho\u2019s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.
p8
aVAnd he liked to do an exercise with his students
p9
aVwhere he got them to take a piece of paper
p10
aVand draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,
p11
aVvery quickly, just as quickly as they could.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd in fact, we\u2019re going to do that exercise right now.
p14
aVYou all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.
p15
aVIt\u2019s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
p16
aVI need you to turn that piece of paper over;
p17
aVyou should find that it\u2019s blank on the other side.
p18
aVAnd there should be a pencil.
p19
aVAnd I want you to pick somebody that\u2019s seated next to you,
p20
aVand when I say, go, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?
p21
aVSo, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.
p22
aVYou\u2019ve got 30 seconds, you\u2019d better be fast.
p23
aVCome on: those masterpieces ...
p24
aVOK? Stop. All right, now.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VYes, lot\u2019s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.
p29
aVLots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VAm I hearing a few "sorry\u2019s"? I think I\u2019m hearing a few sorry\u2019s.
p34
aVYup, yup, I think I probably am.
p35
aVAnd that\u2019s exactly what happens every time,
p36
aVevery time you do this with adults.
p37
aVMcKim found this every time he did it with his students.
p38
aVHe got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry\u2019s.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd he would point this out as evidence
p43
aVthat we fear the judgment of our peers,
p44
aVand that we\u2019re embarrassed about showing our ideas
p45
aVto people we think of as our peers, to those around us.
p46
aVAnd this fear is what causes us
p47
aVto be conservative in our thinking.
p48
aVSo we might have a wild idea,
p49
aVbut we\u2019re afraid to share it with anybody else.
p50
aa(lp51
VOK, so if you try the same exercise with kids,
p52
aVthey have no embarrassment at all.
p53
aVThey just quite happily show their masterpiece
p54
aVto whoever wants to look at it.
p55
aVBut as they learn to become adults,
p56
aVthey become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,
p57
aVand they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.
p58
aVAnd in studies of kids playing, it\u2019s been shown
p59
aVtime after time that kids who feel secure,
p60
aVwho are in a kind of trusted environment \u2014
p61
aVthey\u2019re the ones that feel most free to play.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd if you\u2019re starting a design firm, let\u2019s say,
p64
aVthen you probably also want to create
p65
aVa place where people have the same kind of security.
p66
aVWhere they have the same kind of security to take risks.
p67
aVMaybe have the same kind of security to play.
p68
aa(lp69
VBefore founding IDEO, David said that what he wanted to do
p70
aVwas to form a company where all the employees are my best friends.
p71
aVNow, that wasn\u2019t just self-indulgence.
p72
aVHe knew that friendship is a short cut to play.
p73
aVAnd he knew that it gives us a sense of trust,
p74
aVand it allows us then to take the kind of creative risks
p75
aVthat we need to take as designers.
p76
aVAnd so, that decision to work with his friends \u2014
p77
aVnow he has 550 of them \u2014 was what got IDEO started.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd our studios, like, I think, many creative workplaces today,
p80
aVare designed to help people feel relaxed:
p81
aVfamiliar with their surroundings,
p82
aVcomfortable with the people that they\u2019re working with.
p83
aVIt takes more than decor, but I think we\u2019ve all seen that
p84
aVcreative companies do often have symbols in the workplace
p85
aVthat remind people to be playful,
p86
aVand that it\u2019s a permissive environment.
p87
aVSo, whether it\u2019s this microbus meeting room
p88
aVthat we have in one our buildings at IDEO;
p89
aVor at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;
p90
aVor at the Googleplex, where
p91
aVit\u2019s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,
p92
aVand even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.
p93
aVDon\u2019t know the reason for the pink flamingos,
p94
aVbut anyway, they\u2019re there in the garden.
p95
aVOr even in the Swiss office of Google,
p96
aVwhich perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.
p97
aVAnd my theory is, that\u2019s so the Swiss can prove
p98
aVto their Californian colleagues that they\u2019re not boring.
p99
aVSo they have the slide, and they even have a fireman\u2019s pole.
p100
aVDon\u2019t know what they do with that, but they have one.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo all of these places have these symbols.
p103
aVNow, our big symbol at IDEO is actually
p104
aVnot so much the place, it\u2019s a thing.
p105
aVAnd it\u2019s actually something that we invented a few years ago,
p106
aVor created a few years ago.
p107
aVIt\u2019s a toy; it\u2019s called a "finger blaster."
p108
aVAnd I forgot to bring one up with me.
p109
aVSo if somebody can reach under the chair that\u2019s next to them,
p110
aVyou\u2019ll find something taped underneath it.
p111
aVThat\u2019s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you
p114
aVhas got one taped under your chair.
p115
aVAnd I\u2019m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.
p116
aVBut before we start, I need just to put these on.
p117
aVThank you. All right.
p118
aVNow, what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to see how \u2014
p119
aVI can\u2019t see out of these, OK.
p120
aVI\u2019m going to see how many of you at the back of the room
p121
aVcan actually get those things onto the stage.
p122
aVSo the way they work is, you know,
p123
aVyou just put your finger in the thing,
p124
aVpull them back, and off you go.
p125
aVSo, don\u2019t look backwards. That\u2019s my only recommendation here.
p126
aVI want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage.
p127
aVSo come on! There we go, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh.
p128
aVI have another idea. I wanted to \u2014 there we go.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VThere we go.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VThank you, thank you, thank you.
p137
aVNot bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VWell, they\u2019re still coming in from the back there;
p142
aVthey\u2019re still coming in.
p143
aVSome of you haven\u2019t fired them yet.
p144
aVCan you not figure out how to do it, or something?
p145
aVIt\u2019s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this
p146
aVin the first 10 seconds, when they pick it up.
p147
aVAll right. This is pretty good; this is pretty good.
p148
aVOkay, all right. Let\u2019s \u2014 I suppose we'd better...
p149
aVI'd better clear these up out of the way;
p150
aVotherwise, I\u2019m going to trip over them.
p151
aVAll right. So the rest of you can save them
p152
aVfor when I say something particularly boring,
p153
aVand then you can fire at me.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VAll right. I think I\u2019m going to take these off now,
p158
aVbecause I can\u2019t see a damn thing when I\u2019ve \u2014 all right, OK.
p159
aVSo, ah, that was fun.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAll right, good.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, OK, so why?
p168
aVSo we have the finger blasters. Other people have dinosaurs, you know.
p169
aVWhy do we have them? Well, as I said,
p170
aVwe have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.
p171
aVBut why is it important?
p172
aVWe use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.
p173
aVWe think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.
p174
aVHelps us do our jobs better,
p175
aVand helps us feel better when we do them.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, an adult encountering a new situation \u2014
p178
aVwhen we encounter a new situation we have a tendency
p179
aVto want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.
p180
aVAnd there\u2019s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.
p181
aVLife\u2019s complicated; we want to figure out
p182
aVwhat\u2019s going on around us very quickly.
p183
aVI suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists
p184
aVprobably have lots of reasons [for] why we want
p185
aVto categorize new things very, very quickly.
p186
aVOne of them might be, you know,
p187
aVwhen we see this funny stripy thing:
p188
aVis that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?
p189
aVOr is it just some weird shadows on the tree?
p190
aVWe need to figure that out pretty fast.
p191
aVWell, at least, we did once.
p192
aVMost of us don\u2019t need to anymore, I suppose.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.
p195
aVThat\u2019s what it is, isn\u2019t it? Of course it is, of course it is.
p196
aVWell, not necessarily.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VKids are more engaged with open possibilities.
p201
aVNow, they\u2019ll certainly \u2014 when they come across something new,
p202
aVthey\u2019ll certainly ask, "What is it?"
p203
aVOf course they will. But they\u2019ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"
p204
aVAnd you know, the more creative of them
p205
aVmight get to a really interesting example.
p206
aVAnd this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.
p207
aVAny parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.
p208
aVYeah, thought so. So we\u2019ve all seen it, haven\u2019t we?
p209
aa(lp210
VWe\u2019ve all told stories about how, on Christmas morning,
p211
aVour kids end up playing with the boxes
p212
aVfar more than they play with the toys that are inside them.
p213
aVAnd you know, from an exploration perspective,
p214
aVthis behavior makes complete sense.
p215
aVBecause you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy.
p216
aVEven one like, say, Tickle Me Elmo \u2014
p217
aVwhich, despite its ingenuity, really only does one thing,
p218
aVwhereas boxes offer an infinite number of choices.
p219
aVSo again, this is another one of those playful activities
p220
aVthat, as we get older, we tend to forget and we have to relearn.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo another one of Bob McKim\u2019s favorite exercises
p223
aVis called the "30 Circles Test."
p224
aVSo we\u2019re back to work. You guys are going to get back to work again.
p225
aVTurn that piece of paper that you did the sketch on
p226
aVback over, and you\u2019ll find those 30 circles printed on the piece of paper.
p227
aVSo it should look like this. You should be looking at something like this.
p228
aVSo what I\u2019m going to do is, I\u2019m going to give you minute,
p229
aVand I want you to adapt as many of those circles as you can
p230
aVinto objects of some form.
p231
aVSo for example, you could turn one into a football,
p232
aVor another one into a sun. All I\u2019m interested in is quantity.
p233
aVI want you to do as many of them as you can,
p234
aVin the minute that I\u2019m just about to give you.
p235
aVSo, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.
p236
aa(lp237
VOkay. Put down your pencils, as they say.
p238
aVSo, who got more than five circles figured out?
p239
aVHopefully everybody? More than 10?
p240
aVKeep your hands up if you did 10.
p241
aV15? 20? Anybody get all 30?
p242
aVNo? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.
p243
aVDid anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?
p244
aVHappy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?
p245
aVAnybody use my examples? The sun and the football?
p246
aVGreat. Cool. So I was really interested in quantity.
p247
aVI wasn\u2019t actually very interested in whether they were all different.
p248
aVI just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible.
p249
aVAnd one of the things we tend to do as adults, again, is we edit things.
p250
aVWe stop ourselves from doing things.
p251
aVWe self-edit as we\u2019re having ideas.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd in some cases, our desire to be original is actually a form of editing.
p254
aVAnd that actually isn\u2019t necessarily really playful.
p255
aVSo that ability just to go for it and explore lots of things,
p256
aVeven if they don\u2019t seem that different from each other,
p257
aVis actually something that kids do well, and it is a form of play.
p258
aVSo now, Bob McKim did another
p259
aVversion of this test
p260
aVin a rather famous experiment that was done in the 1960s.
p261
aVAnybody know what this is? It\u2019s the peyote cactus.
p262
aVIt\u2019s the plant from which you can create mescaline,
p263
aVone of the psychedelic drugs.
p264
aVFor those of you around in the '60s, you probably know it well.
p265
aa(lp266
VMcKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment
p267
aVthat he and his colleagues conducted
p268
aVto test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.
p269
aVSo he picked 27 professionals \u2014 they were
p270
aVengineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,
p271
aVfurniture designers even, artists \u2014
p272
aVand he asked them to come along one evening,
p273
aVand to bring a problem with them that they were working on.
p274
aVHe gave each of them some mescaline,
p275
aVand had them listen to some nice, relaxing music for a while.
p276
aVAnd then he did what\u2019s called the Purdue Creativity Test.
p277
aVYou might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"
p278
aVIt\u2019s basically the same thing as the 30 circles thing that I just had you do.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow, actually, he gave the test before the drugs
p281
aVand after the drugs, to see
p282
aVwhat the difference was in people\u2019s
p283
aVfacility and speed with coming up with ideas.
p284
aVAnd then he asked them to go away
p285
aVand work on those problems that they\u2019d brought.
p286
aVAnd they\u2019d come up with a bunch of
p287
aVinteresting solutions \u2014 and actually, quite
p288
aVvalid solutions \u2014 to the things that they\u2019d been working on.
p289
aVAnd so, some of the things that they figured out,
p290
aVsome of these individuals figured out;
p291
aVin one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses
p292
aVthat were accepted by clients;
p293
aVa design of a solar space probe experiment;
p294
aVa redesign of the linear electron accelerator;
p295
aVan engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder \u2014
p296
aVyou can tell this is a while ago;
p297
aVthe completion of a line of furniture;
p298
aVand even a new conceptual model of the photon.
p299
aVSo it was a pretty successful evening.
p300
aa(lp301
VIn fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley
p302
aVgot off to its great start with innovation.
p303
aVWe don\u2019t know, but it may be.
p304
aVWe need to ask some of the CEOs
p305
aVwhether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.
p306
aVBut really, it wasn\u2019t the drugs that were important;
p307
aVit was this idea that what the drugs did
p308
aVwould help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,
p309
aVand getting them to forget the adult behaviors
p310
aVthat were getting in the way of their ideas.
p311
aVBut it\u2019s hard to break our habits, our adult habits.
p312
aa(lp313
VAt IDEO we have brainstorming rules written on the walls.
p314
aVEdicts like, "Defer judgment," or "Go for quantity."
p315
aVAnd somehow that seems wrong.
p316
aVI mean, can you have rules about creativity?
p317
aVWell, it sort of turns out that we need rules
p318
aVto help us break the old rules and norms
p319
aVthat otherwise we might bring to the creative process.
p320
aVAnd we\u2019ve certainly learnt that over time,
p321
aVyou get much better brainstorming,
p322
aVmuch more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules.
p323
aVNow, of course, many designers, many individual designers,
p324
aVachieve this is in a much more organic way.
p325
aa(lp326
VI think the Eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation.
p327
aVAnd they experimented with plywood for many years
p328
aVwithout necessarily having one single goal in mind.
p329
aVThey were exploring following what was interesting to them.
p330
aVThey went from designing splints for wounded soldiers
p331
aVcoming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,
p332
aVand from this experiment they moved on to chairs.
p333
aa(lp334
VThrough constant experimentation with materials,
p335
aVthey developed a wide range of iconic solutions
p336
aVthat we know today, eventually resulting in,
p337
aVof course, the legendary lounge chair.
p338
aVNow, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,
p339
aVthen we wouldn\u2019t be the beneficiaries of so many
p340
aVwonderful designs today.
p341
aVAnd of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,
p342
aVfrom films to buildings, from games to graphics.
p343
aVSo, they\u2019re great examples, I think, of exploration
p344
aVand experimentation in design.
p345
aa(lp346
VNow, while the Eameses were exploring those possibilities,
p347
aVthey were also exploring physical objects.
p348
aVAnd they were doing that through building prototypes.
p349
aVAnd building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I\u2019d talk about.
p350
aVSo the average Western first-grader
p351
aVspends as much as 50 percent of their play time
p352
aVtaking part in what\u2019s called "construction play."
p353
aVConstruction play \u2014 it\u2019s playful, obviously,
p354
aVbut also a powerful way to learn.
p355
aVWhen play is about building a tower out of blocks,
p356
aVthe kid begins to learn a lot about towers.
p357
aVAnd as they repeatedly knock it down and start again,
p358
aVlearning is happening as a sort of by-product of play.
p359
aVIt\u2019s classically learning by doing.
p360
aa(lp361
VNow, David Kelley calls this behavior,
p362
aVwhen it\u2019s carried out by designers, "thinking with your hands."
p363
aVAnd it typically involves making multiple,
p364
aVlow-resolution prototypes very quickly,
p365
aVoften by bringing lots of found elements together
p366
aVin order to get to a solution.
p367
aVOn one of his earliest projects, the team was kind of stuck,
p368
aVand they came up with a mechanism by hacking together
p369
aVa prototype made from a roll-on deodorant.
p370
aVNow, that became the first commercial computer mouse
p371
aVfor the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, they learned their way to that by building prototypes.
p374
aVAnother example is a group of designers
p375
aVwho were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons.
p376
aVThey were meeting with them; they were talking to the surgeons
p377
aVabout what it was they needed with this device.
p378
aVAnd one of the designers ran out of the room
p379
aVand grabbed a white board marker and a film canister \u2014
p380
aVwhich is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium \u2014
p381
aVand a clothespin. He taped them all together,
p382
aVran back into the room and said, "You mean, something like this?"
p383
aVAnd the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said,
p384
aVwell, I want to hold it like this, or like that.
p385
aVAnd all of a sudden a productive conversation
p386
aVwas happening about design around a tangible object.
p387
aVAnd in the end it turned into a real device.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd so this behavior is all about quickly getting something
p390
aVinto the real world, and having your thinking advanced as a result.
p391
aVAt IDEO there\u2019s a kind of a back-to-preschool feel
p392
aVsometimes about the environment.
p393
aVThe prototyping carts, filled with colored paper
p394
aVand Play-Doh and glue sticks and stuff \u2014
p395
aVI mean, they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them.
p396
aVBut the important idea is that everything\u2019s at hand, everything\u2019s around.
p397
aVSo when designers are working on ideas,
p398
aVthey can start building stuff whenever they want.
p399
aVThey don\u2019t necessarily even have to go
p400
aVinto some kind of formal workshop to do it.
p401
aVAnd we think that\u2019s pretty important.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd then the sad thing is, although preschools
p404
aVare full of this kind of stuff, as kids go through the school system
p405
aVit all gets taken away.
p406
aVThey lose this stuff that facilitates
p407
aVthis sort of playful and building mode of thinking.
p408
aVAnd of course, by the time you get to the average workplace,
p409
aVmaybe the best construction tool we have
p410
aVmight be the Post-it notes. It\u2019s pretty barren.
p411
aVBut by giving project teams and the clients
p412
aVwho they\u2019re working with permission to think with their hands,
p413
aVquite complex ideas can spring into life
p414
aVand go right through to execution much more easily.
p415
aa(lp416
VThis is a nurse using a very simple \u2014 as you can see \u2014 plasticine prototype,
p417
aVexplaining what she wants out of a portable information system
p418
aVto a team of technologists and designers
p419
aVthat are working with her in a hospital.
p420
aVAnd just having this very simple prototype
p421
aVallows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way.
p422
aVAnd of course, by building quick prototypes,
p423
aVwe can get out and test our ideas with consumers
p424
aVand users much more quickly
p425
aVthan if we\u2019re trying to describe them through words.
p426
aa(lp427
VBut what about designing something that isn\u2019t physical?
p428
aVSomething like a service or an experience?
p429
aVSomething that exists as a series of interactions over time?
p430
aVInstead of building play, this can be approached with role-play.
p431
aVSo, if you\u2019re designing an interaction between two people \u2014
p432
aVsuch as, I don\u2019t know \u2014 ordering food at a fast food joint
p433
aVor something, you need to be able to imagine
p434
aVhow that experience might feel over a period of time.
p435
aVAnd I think the best way to achieve that,
p436
aVand get a feeling for any flaws in your design, is to act it out.
p437
aa(lp438
VSo we do quite a lot of work at IDEO
p439
aVtrying to convince our clients of this.
p440
aVThey can be a little skeptical; I\u2019ll come back to that.
p441
aVBut a place, I think, where the effort is really worthwhile
p442
aVis where people are wrestling with quite serious problems \u2014
p443
aVthings like education or security or finance or health.
p444
aVAnd this is another example in a healthcare environment
p445
aVof some doctors and some nurses and designers
p446
aVacting out a service scenario around patient care.
p447
aVBut you know, many adults
p448
aVare pretty reluctant to engage with role-play.
p449
aVSome of it\u2019s embarrassment and some of it is because
p450
aVthey just don\u2019t believe that what emerges is necessarily valid.
p451
aVThey dismiss an interesting interaction by saying,
p452
aVyou know, "That\u2019s just happening because they\u2019re acting it out."
p453
aa(lp454
VResearch into kids' behavior actually suggests
p455
aVthat it\u2019s worth taking role-playing seriously.
p456
aVBecause when children play a role,
p457
aVthey actually follow social scripts quite closely
p458
aVthat they\u2019ve learnt from us as adults.
p459
aVIf one kid plays "store," and another one\u2019s playing "house,"
p460
aVthen the whole kind of play falls down.
p461
aVSo they get used to quite quickly
p462
aVto understanding the rules for social interactions,
p463
aVand are actually quite quick to point out when they\u2019re broken.
p464
aa(lp465
VSo when, as adults, we role-play,
p466
aVthen we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.
p467
aVWe\u2019ve gone through lots of experiences in life,
p468
aVand they provide a strong intuition
p469
aVas to whether an interaction is going to work.
p470
aVSo we\u2019re very good, when acting out a solution,
p471
aVat spotting whether something lacks authenticity.
p472
aVSo role-play is actually, I think,
p473
aVquite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.
p474
aVAnother way for us, as designers, to explore role-play
p475
aVis to put ourselves through an experience which we\u2019re designing for,
p476
aVand project ourselves into an experience.
p477
aa(lp478
VSo here are some designers who are trying to understand
p479
aVwhat it might feel like to sleep in a
p480
aVconfined space on an airplane.
p481
aVAnd so they grabbed some very simple materials, you can see,
p482
aVand did this role-play, this kind of very crude role-play,
p483
aVjust to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers
p484
aVif they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes.
p485
aa(lp486
VThis is one of our designers, Kristian Simsarian,
p487
aVand he\u2019s putting himself through the experience of being an ER patient.
p488
aVNow, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.
p489
aVOne of the reasons he chose to take
p490
aVthis rather large video camera with him was
p491
aVbecause he didn\u2019t want the doctors and nurses thinking
p492
aVhe was actually sick, and sticking something into him
p493
aVthat he was going to regret later.
p494
aVSo anyhow, he went there with his video camera,
p495
aVand it\u2019s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.
p496
aVBecause when we looked at the video when he got back,
p497
aVwe saw 20 minutes of this.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Laughter)
p500
aa(lp501
VAnd also, the amazing thing about this video \u2014
p502
aVas soon as you see it you immediately
p503
aVproject yourself into that experience.
p504
aVAnd you know what it feels like: all of that uncertainty
p505
aVwhile you\u2019re left out in the hallway
p506
aVwhile the docs are dealing with some more urgent case
p507
aVin one of the emergency rooms, wondering what the heck\u2019s going on.
p508
aVAnd so this notion of using role-play \u2014
p509
aVor in this case, living through the experience
p510
aVas a way of creating empathy \u2014
p511
aVparticularly when you use video, is really powerful.
p512
aa(lp513
VOr another one of our designers, Altay Sendil:
p514
aVhe\u2019s here having his chest waxed, not because he\u2019s very vain,
p515
aValthough actually he is \u2014 no, I\u2019m kidding \u2014
p516
aVbut in order to empathize with the pain that chronic care patients
p517
aVgo through when they\u2019re having dressings removed.
p518
aVAnd so sometimes these analogous experiences,
p519
aVanalogous role-play, can also be quite valuable.
p520
aa(lp521
VSo when a kid dresses up as a firefighter, you know,
p522
aVhe\u2019s beginning to try on that identity.
p523
aVHe wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter.
p524
aVWe\u2019re doing the same thing as designers.
p525
aVWe\u2019re trying on these experiences.
p526
aVAnd so the idea of role-play is both as an empathy tool,
p527
aVas well as a tool for prototyping experiences.
p528
aVAnd you know, we kind of admire people who do this at IDEO anyway.
p529
aVNot just because they lead to insights about the experience,
p530
aVbut also because of their willingness to explore
p531
aVand their ability to unselfconsciously
p532
aVsurrender themselves to the experience.
p533
aVIn short, we admire their willingness to play.
p534
aa(lp535
VPlayful exploration, playful building and role-play:
p536
aVthose are some of the ways that designers use play in their work.
p537
aVAnd so far, I admit, this might feel
p538
aVlike it\u2019s a message just to go out and play like a kid.
p539
aVAnd to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.
p540
aVThe first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.
p541
aVPlay has rules, especially when it\u2019s group play.
p542
aVWhen kids play tea party, or they play cops and robbers,
p543
aVthey\u2019re following a script that they\u2019ve agreed to.
p544
aVAnd it\u2019s this code negotiation that leads to productive play.
p545
aa(lp546
VSo, remember the sketching task we did at the beginning?
p547
aVThe kind of little face, the portrait you did?
p548
aVWell, imagine if you did the same task with friends
p549
aVwhile you were drinking in a pub.
p550
aVBut everybody agreed to play a game
p551
aVwhere the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks.
p552
aVThat framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing,
p553
aVdifficult situation into a fun game.
p554
aVAs a result, we\u2019d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time \u2014
p555
aVbut because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together.
p556
aa(lp557
VBut there aren\u2019t just rules about how to play;
p558
aVthere are rules about when to play.
p559
aVKids don\u2019t play all the time, obviously.
p560
aVThey transition in and out of it,
p561
aVand good teachers spend a lot of time
p562
aVthinking about how to move kids through these experiences.
p563
aVAs designers, we need to be able to transition in and out of play also.
p564
aVAnd if we\u2019re running design studios
p565
aVwe need to be able to figure out, how can we transition
p566
aVdesigners through these different experiences?
p567
aVI think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of \u2014
p568
aa(lp569
VI think what\u2019s very different about design
p570
aVis that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation.
p571
aVWe go through a sort of generative mode,
p572
aVwhere we\u2019re exploring many ideas;
p573
aVand then we come back together again,
p574
aVand come back looking for that solution,
p575
aVand developing that solution.
p576
aVI think they\u2019re two quite different modes:
p577
aVdivergence and convergence.
p578
aVAnd I think it\u2019s probably in the divergent mode
p579
aVthat we most need playfulness.
p580
aVPerhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious.
p581
aVAnd so being able to move between those modes
p582
aVis really quite important. So, it\u2019s where there\u2019s a
p583
aVmore nuanced version view of play, I think, is required.
p584
aa(lp585
VBecause it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute.
p586
aVYou\u2019re either playful or you\u2019re serious, and you can\u2019t be both.
p587
aVBut that\u2019s not really true: you can be a serious professional adult
p588
aVand, at times, be playful.
p589
aVIt\u2019s not an either/or; it\u2019s an "and."
p590
aVYou can be serious and play.
p591
aVSo to sum it up, we need trust to play,
p592
aVand we need trust to be creative. So, there\u2019s a connection.
p593
aVAnd there are a series of behaviors that we\u2019ve learnt as kids,
p594
aVand that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers.
p595
aVThey include exploration, which is about going for quantity;
p596
aVbuilding, and thinking with your hands;
p597
aVand role-play, where acting it out helps us both
p598
aVto have more empathy for the situations in which we\u2019re designing,
p599
aVand to create services and experiences
p600
aVthat are seamless and authentic.
