VWhen I was 11,
p4
aVI remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
p5
aVMy father was listening to BBC News
p6
aVon his small, gray radio.
p7
aVThere was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,
p8
aVbecause the news mostly depressed him.
p9
aa(lp10
V"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.
p11
aa(lp12
VI didn't know what it meant,
p13
aVbut I could see that my father was very, very happy.
p14
aa(lp15
V"You can go to a real school now," he said.
p16
aa(lp17
VA morning that I will never forget.
p18
aVA real school.
p19
aVYou see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan
p20
aVand made it illegal for girls to go to school.
p21
aVSo for the next five years, I dressed as a boy
p22
aVto escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed
p23
aVto be outside alone, to a secret school.
p24
aVIt was the only way we both could be educated.
p25
aVEach day, we took a different route
p26
aVso that no one would suspect where we were going.
p27
aVWe would cover our books in grocery bags
p28
aVso it would seem we were just out shopping.
p29
aVThe school was in a house,
p30
aVmore than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
p31
aVIt was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
p32
aVWe all knew we were risking our lives \u2014
p33
aVthe teacher, the students and our parents.
p34
aVFrom time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled
p35
aVfor a week because Taliban were suspicious.
p36
aVWe always wondered what they knew about us.
p37
aVWere we being followed?
p38
aVDo they know where we live?
p39
aVWe were scared,
p40
aVbut still, school was where we wanted to be.
p41
aa(lp42
VI was very lucky to grow up in a family
p43
aVwhere education was prized and daughters were treasured.
p44
aVMy grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
p45
aVA total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,
p46
aVhe insisted that his daughter, my mom,
p47
aVgo to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
p48
aVBut my educated mother became a teacher.
p49
aVThere she is.
p50
aVShe retired two years ago, only to turn our house
p51
aVinto a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
p52
aVAnd my father \u2014 that's him \u2014
p53
aVhe was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
p54
aVThere was no question that his children
p55
aVwould receive an education, including his daughters,
p56
aVdespite the Taliban, despite the risks.
p57
aVTo him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
p58
aVDuring Taliban years, I remember
p59
aVthere were times I would get so frustrated by our life
p60
aVand always being scared and not seeing a future.
p61
aVI would want to quit,
p62
aVbut my father,
p63
aVhe would say,
p64
aV"Listen, my daughter,
p65
aVyou can lose everything you own in your life.
p66
aVYour money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
p67
aVBut the one thing that will always remain with you
p68
aVis what is here,
p69
aVand if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,
p70
aVwe will.
p71
aVSo do you still not want to continue?"
p72
aa(lp73
VToday I am 22.
p74
aVI was raised in a country that has been destroyed
p75
aVby decades of war.
p76
aVFewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,
p77
aVand had my family not been so committed to my education,
p78
aVI would be one of them.
p79
aVInstead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VWhen I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,
p84
aVthe one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,
p85
aVwas among the first to congratulate me.
p86
aVHe not only brags about my college degree,
p87
aVbut also that I was the first woman,
p88
aVand that I am the first woman
p89
aVto drive him through the streets of Kabul.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VMy family believes in me.
p94
aVI dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
p95
aVThat's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,
p96
aVa global campaign to educate women.
p97
aVThat's why I cofounded SOLA,
p98
aVthe first and perhaps only boarding school
p99
aVfor girls in Afghanistan,
p100
aVa country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
p101
aVThe exciting thing is that I see students at my school
p102
aVwith ambition grabbing at opportunity.
p103
aVAnd I see their parents and their fathers
p104
aVwho, like my own, advocate for them,
p105
aVdespite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
p106
aa(lp107
VLike Ahmed. That's not his real name,
p108
aVand I cannot show you his face,
p109
aVbut Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
p110
aVLess than a month ago, he and his daughter
p111
aVwere on their way from SOLA to their village,
p112
aVand they literally missed being killed
p113
aVby a roadside bomb by minutes.
p114
aVAs he arrived home, the phone rang,
p115
aVa voice warning him
p116
aVthat if he sent his daughter back to school,
p117
aVthey would try again.
p118
aa(lp119
V"Kill me now, if you wish," he said,
p120
aV"but I will not ruin my daughter's future
p121
aVbecause of your old and backward ideas."
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat I've come to realize about Afghanistan,
p124
aVand this is something that is often dismissed in the West,
p125
aVthat behind most of us who succeed
p126
aVis a father who recognizes the value in his daughter
p127
aVand who sees that her success is his success.
p128
aVIt's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
p129
aVIn fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators
p130
aVof a bright future for their daughters,
p131
aVbut in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,
p132
aVwe must have the support of men.
p133
aVUnder the Taliban, girls who went to school
p134
aVnumbered in the hundreds \u2014
p135
aVremember, it was illegal.
p136
aVBut today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Applause)
p139
aa(lp140
VAfghanistan looks so different from here in America.
p141
aVI find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
p142
aVI fear that these changes will not last
p143
aVmuch beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
p144
aVBut when I am back in Afghanistan,
p145
aVwhen I see the students in my school
p146
aVand their parents who advocate for them,
p147
aVwho encourage them, I see a promising future
p148
aVand lasting change.
p149
aVTo me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,
p150
aVand every single day
p151
aVthe girls of SOLA remind me of that.
p152
aVLike me, they are dreaming big.
p153
aa(lp154
