VYou may not know this,
p4
aVbut you are celebrating an anniversary with me.
p5
aVI'm not married,
p6
aVbut one year ago today,
p7
aVI woke up
p8
aVfrom a month-long coma,
p9
aVfollowing a double lung transplant.
p10
aVCrazy, I know. Insane.
p11
aVThank you.
p12
aa(lp13
VSix years before that,
p14
aVI was starting my career
p15
aVas an opera singer in Europe,
p16
aVwhen I was diagnosed with
p17
aVidiopathic pulmonary hypertension \u2014
p18
aValso known as PH.
p19
aVIt happens when there's a thickening
p20
aVin the pulmonary veins,
p21
aVmaking the right side of the heart
p22
aVwork overtime,
p23
aVand causing what I call
p24
aVthe reverse-Grinch effect.
p25
aVMy heart was three-and-a-half sizes
p26
aVtoo big.
p27
aVPhysical activity becomes very difficult
p28
aVfor people with this condition,
p29
aVand usually after two to five years,
p30
aVyou die.
p31
aVI went to see this specialist,
p32
aVand she was top-of-the-field
p33
aVand told me I had to stop singing.
p34
aVShe said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."
p35
aVWhile she didn't have any medical evidence
p36
aVto back up her claim
p37
aVthat there was a relationship
p38
aVbetween operatic arias
p39
aVand pulmonary hypertension,
p40
aVshe was absolutely emphatic
p41
aVI was singing my own obituary.
p42
aVI was very limited by my condition, physically.
p43
aVBut I was not limited when I sang,
p44
aVand as air came up from my lungs,
p45
aVthrough my vocal cords
p46
aVand passed my lips as sound,
p47
aVit was the closest thing I had ever come
p48
aVto transcendence.
p49
aVAnd just because of someone's hunch,
p50
aVI wasn't going to give it up.
p51
aa(lp52
VThankfully, I met Reda Girgis,
p53
aVwho is dry as toast,
p54
aVbut he and his team at Johns Hopkins
p55
aVdidn't just want me to survive,
p56
aVthey wanted me
p57
aVto live a meaningful life.
p58
aVThis meant making trade-offs.
p59
aVI come from Colorado.
p60
aVIt's a mile high,
p61
aVand I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters
p62
aVand two adoring parents.
p63
aVWell, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.
p64
aVSo I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors
p65
aVand enrolled in a conservatory nearby.
p66
aVI couldn't walk as much as I used to,
p67
aVso I opted for five-inch heels.
p68
aVAnd I gave up salt,
p69
aVI went vegan,
p70
aVand I started taking huge doses of
p71
aVsildenafil,
p72
aValso known as Viagra.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VMy father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing
p77
aVin alternative or traditional therapies
p78
aVfor PH,
p79
aVbut after six months,
p80
aVI couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.
p81
aVI could barely stand up
p82
aVwithout feeling like I was going to faint.
p83
aVI had a heart catheterization,
p84
aVwhere they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,
p85
aVwhich is supposed to be between 15 and 20.
p86
aVMine was 146.
p87
aVI like to do things big,
p88
aVand it meant one thing:
p89
aVthere is a big gun treatment
p90
aVfor pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,
p91
aVand it's not just a drug;
p92
aVit's a way of life.
p93
aVDoctors insert a catheter into your chest,
p94
aVwhich is attached to a pump
p95
aVthat weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.
p96
aVEvery day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,
p97
aVadministering medicine
p98
aVdirectly to your heart,
p99
aVand it's not
p100
aVa particularly preferable
p101
aVmedicine in many senses.
p102
aVThis is a list of the side effects:
p103
aVif you eat too much salt,
p104
aVlike a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
p105
aVyou'll probably end up in the ICU.
p106
aVIf you go through a metal detector,
p107
aVyou'll probably die.
p108
aVIf you get a bubble in your medicine \u2014
p109
aVbecause you have to mix it every morning \u2014
p110
aVand it stays in there,
p111
aVyou probably die.
p112
aVIf you run out of medicine, you definitely die.
p113
aa(lp114
VNo one wants to go on Flolan.
p115
aVBut when I needed it,
p116
aVit was a godsend.
p117
aVWithin a few days, I could walk again.
p118
aVWithin a few weeks, I was performing,
p119
aVand in a few months,
p120
aVI debuted at the Kennedy Center.
p121
aVThe pump was a little bit problematic when performing,
p122
aVso I'd attach it to my inner thigh
p123
aVwith the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
p124
aVLiterally hundreds of elevator rides
p125
aVwere spent with me alone
p126
aVstuffing the pump into my Spanx,
p127
aVhoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.
p128
aVAnd the tubing coming out of my chest
p129
aVwas a nightmare for costume designers.
p130
aVI graduated from graduate school in 2006,
p131
aVand I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.
p132
aVA few days after arriving,
p133
aVI met this wonderful, old conductor
p134
aVwho started casting me in all of these roles.
p135
aVAnd before long, I was commuting
p136
aVbetween Budapest, Milan
p137
aVand Florence.
p138
aVThough I was attached
p139
aVto this ugly, unwanted,
p140
aVhigh-maintenance, mechanical pet,
p141
aVmy life was kind of like the happy part in an opera \u2014
p142
aVvery complicated,
p143
aVbut in a good way.
p144
aa(lp145
VThen in February
p146
aVof 2008,
p147
aVmy grandfather passed away.
p148
aVHe was a big figure in all of our lives,
p149
aVand we loved him very much.
p150
aVIt certainly didn't prepare me
p151
aVfor what came next.
p152
aVSeven weeks later,
p153
aVI got a call from my family.
p154
aVMy father had been in a catastrophic car accident,
p155
aVand he died.
p156
aVAt 24, my death would have been
p157
aVentirely expected.
p158
aVBut his \u2014
p159
aVwell, the only way I can articulate how it felt
p160
aVwas that it precipitated
p161
aVmy medical decline.
p162
aVAgainst my doctors' and family's wishes,
p163
aVI needed to go back for the funeral.
p164
aVI had to say goodbye
p165
aVin some way, shape or form.
p166
aVBut soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,
p167
aVand I had to return to sea level,
p168
aVdoing so knowing
p169
aVthat I probably would never see my home again.
p170
aa(lp171
VI canceled most of my engagements that summer,
p172
aVbut I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.
p173
aVAfter one performance,
p174
aVI could barely drag myself
p175
aVfrom the stage to the taxicab.
p176
aVI sat down and felt the blood
p177
aVrush down from my face,
p178
aVand in the heat of the desert,
p179
aVI was freezing cold.
p180
aVMy fingers started turning blue,
p181
aVand I was like, "What is going on here?"
p182
aVI heard my heart's valves
p183
aVsnapping open and closed.
p184
aVThe cab stopped,
p185
aVand I pulled my body from it
p186
aVfeeling each ounce of weight
p187
aVas I walked to the elevator.
p188
aVI fell through my apartment door
p189
aVand crawled to the bathroom
p190
aVwhere I found my problem:
p191
aVI had forgotten to mix in
p192
aVthe most important part of my medicine.
p193
aVI was dying,
p194
aVand if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,
p195
aVI would never leave that apartment alive.
p196
aVI started mixing,
p197
aVand I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,
p198
aVbut I just kept on going.
p199
aVFinally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,
p200
aVI attached the pump to the tubing
p201
aVand lay there hoping it would kick in
p202
aVsoon enough.
p203
aVIf it didn't, I'd probably see my father
p204
aVsooner than I anticipated.
p205
aVThankfully, in a few minutes,
p206
aVI saw the signature hive-like rash
p207
aVappear on my legs,
p208
aVwhich is a side effect of the medication,
p209
aVand I knew I'd be okay.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe're not big on fear in my family,
p212
aVbut I was scared.
p213
aVI went back to the States,
p214
aVanticipating I'd return to Europe,
p215
aVbut the heart catheterization
p216
aVshowed that I wasn't going anywhere
p217
aVfurther that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
p218
aVI performed here and there,
p219
aVbut as my condition deteriorated,
p220
aVso did my voice.
p221
aVMy doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
p222
aVI didn't.
p223
aVI had two friends who had recently died
p224
aVmonths after having very challenging surgeries.
p225
aVI knew another young man, though, who had PH
p226
aVwho died while waiting for one.
p227
aVI wanted to live.
p228
aVI thought stem cells were a good option,
p229
aVbut they hadn't developed to a point
p230
aVwhere I could take advantage of them yet.
p231
aVI officially took a break from singing,
p232
aVand I went to the Cleveland Clinic
p233
aVto be reevaluated
p234
aVfor the third time in five years, for transplant.
p235
aVI was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking
p236
aVwith the head transplant surgeon,
p237
aVand I asked him if I needed a transplant,
p238
aVwhat I could do to prepare.
p239
aVHe said, "Be happy.
p240
aVA happy patient
p241
aVis a healthy patient."
p242
aVIt was like in one verbal swoop
p243
aVhe had channeled my thoughts
p244
aVon life and medicine
p245
aVand Confucius.
p246
aVI still didn't want a transplant,
p247
aVbut in a month,
p248
aVI was back in the hospital
p249
aVwith some severely edemic kankles \u2014
p250
aVvery attractive.
p251
aVAnd it was right-heart failure.
p252
aa(lp253
VI finally decided
p254
aVit was time to take my doctor's advice.
p255
aVIt was time for me to go to Cleveland
p256
aVand to start the agonizing wait
p257
aVfor a match.
p258
aVBut the next morning,
p259
aVwhile I was still in the hospital,
p260
aVI got a telephone call.
p261
aVIt was my doctor in Cleveland,
p262
aVMarie Budev.
p263
aVAnd they had lungs.
p264
aVIt was a match.
p265
aVThey were from Texas.
p266
aVAnd everybody was really happy for me,
p267
aVbut me.
p268
aVBecause, despite their problems,
p269
aVI had spent my whole life training my lungs,
p270
aVand I was not particularly enthusiastic
p271
aVabout giving them up.
p272
aVI flew to Cleveland,
p273
aVand my family rushed there
p274
aVin hopes that they would meet me
p275
aVand say what we knew
p276
aVmight be our final goodbye.
p277
aVBut organs don't wait,
p278
aVand I went into surgery
p279
aVbefore I could say goodbye.
p280
aVThe last thing I remember
p281
aVwas lying on a white blanket,
p282
aVtelling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,
p283
aVand to please try and save my voice.
p284
aVI fell into this apocalyptic dream world.
p285
aa(lp286
VDuring the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,
p287
aVI flatlined twice,
p288
aV40 quarts of blood
p289
aVwere infused into my body.
p290
aVAnd in my surgeon's 20-year career,
p291
aVhe said it was among the most difficult transplants
p292
aVthat he's ever performed.
p293
aVThey left my chest open for two weeks.
p294
aVYou could see my over-sized heart
p295
aVbeating inside of it.
p296
aVI was on a dozen machines
p297
aVthat were keeping me alive.
p298
aVAn infection ravaged my skin.
p299
aVI had hoped my voice would be saved,
p300
aVbut my doctors knew
p301
aVthat the breathing tubes going down my throat
p302
aVmight have already destroyed it.
p303
aVIf they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.
p304
aVSo my doctor got the ENT,
p305
aVthe top guy at the clinic, to come down
p306
aVand give me surgery
p307
aVto move the tubes around my voice box.
p308
aVHe said it would kill me.
p309
aVSo my own surgeon performed the procedure
p310
aVin a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.
p311
aa(lp312
VThough my mom couldn't say goodbye to me
p313
aVbefore the surgery,
p314
aVshe didn't leave my side
p315
aVin the months of recovery that followed.
p316
aVAnd if you want an example
p317
aVof perseverance,
p318
aVgrit and strength
p319
aVin a beautiful, little package,
p320
aVit is her.
p321
aVOne year ago
p322
aVto this very day,
p323
aVI woke up.
p324
aVI was 95 lbs.
p325
aVThere were a dozen tubes
p326
aVcoming in and out of my body.
p327
aVI couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,
p328
aVI couldn't eat, I couldn't move,
p329
aVI certainly couldn't sing,
p330
aVI couldn't even breathe,
p331
aVbut when I looked up
p332
aVand I saw my mother,
p333
aVI couldn't help but smile.
p334
aa(lp335
VWhether by a Mack truck
p336
aVor by heart failure
p337
aVor faulty lungs,
p338
aVdeath happens.
p339
aVBut life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
p340
aVIt's about living.
p341
aVMedical conditions don't negate the human condition.
p342
aVAnd when people are allowed
p343
aVto pursue their passions,
p344
aVdoctors will find they have better,
p345
aVhappier and healthier patients.
p346
aVMy parents were totally stressed out
p347
aVabout me going and auditioning
p348
aVand traveling and performing all over the place,
p349
aVbut they knew that it was much better for me to do that
p350
aVthan be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
p351
aVAnd I'm so grateful they did.
p352
aa(lp353
VThis past summer, when I was running and singing
p354
aVand dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews
p355
aVand my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother
p356
aVin the Colorado Rockies,
p357
aVI couldn't help but think of that doctor
p358
aVwho told me that I couldn't sing.
p359
aVAnd I wanted to tell her,
p360
aVand I want to tell you,
p361
aVwe need to stop letting disease
p362
aVdivorce us from our dreams.
p363
aVWhen we do,
p364
aVwe will find that patients
p365
aVdon't just survive;
p366
aVwe thrive.
p367
aVAnd some of us
p368
aVmight even sing.
p369
