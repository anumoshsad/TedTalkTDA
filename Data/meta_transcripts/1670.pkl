VThe global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest
p4
aVin something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,
p5
aVdating back to at least before Adam Smith.
p6
aVAnd that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions
p7
aVcan display radically different savings behavior?
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,
p10
aVand as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway
p11
aVand we understand a lot about this.
p12
aVWhat I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis
p13
aVand some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on
p14
aVabout the link between the structure of the language you speak
p15
aVand how you find yourself with the propensity to save.
p16
aVLet me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,
p17
aVand then I'll draw that connection.
p18
aa(lp19
VLet's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,
p20
aVor the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
p21
aVOECD countries, by and large, you should think about these
p22
aVas the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.
p23
aVAnd by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment
p24
aVto democracy, open markets and free trade.
p25
aVDespite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo all the way over on the left of this graph,
p28
aVwhat you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,
p29
aVand some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.
p30
aVHolding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.
p31
aVAnd what you can see is that over the last 25 years,
p32
aVGreece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.
p33
aVIt should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow that we see these huge differences in savings rates,
p36
aVhow is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?
p37
aVLet me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.
p38
aVLinguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.
p39
aVAnd then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.
p40
aa(lp41
VMany of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.
p42
aVI grew up in the Midwest of the United States.
p43
aVAnd something I realized quite early on
p44
aVwas that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and \u2014
p45
aVin fact, more fundamentally than that \u2014
p46
aVever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, how might that be? Let me give you an example.
p49
aVSuppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.
p50
aVYou understood exactly what I just said in English.
p51
aVIf we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,
p52
aVI wouldn't have that luxury.
p53
aVI wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.
p54
aVWhat my language would have forced me to do,
p55
aVinstead of just telling you, "This is my uncle,"
p56
aVis to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.
p57
aVMy language would force me to tell you
p58
aVwhether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,
p59
aVwhether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,
p60
aVand if this man was my father's brother,
p61
aVwhether he was older than or younger than my father.
p62
aVAll of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.
p63
aVAnd in fact, if I want to speak correctly,
p64
aVChinese forces me to constantly think about it.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,
p67
aVbut what fascinates me even more today as an economist
p68
aVis that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.
p69
aVSo for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently
p70
aVif I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday,"
p71
aVcurrent rain, "It is raining now,"
p72
aVor future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."
p73
aVNotice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.
p74
aVWhy? Because I have to consider that
p75
aVand I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."
p76
aVIt's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."
p77
aa(lp78
VIn contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.
p79
aVA Chinese speaker can basically say something
p80
aVthat sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.
p81
aVThey can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."
p82
aVIn some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum
p83
aVin the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.
p84
aa(lp85
VIs this difference in languages
p86
aVonly between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?
p87
aVActually, no.
p88
aVSo many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.
p89
aVWhat you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.
p90
aVIt is the only Germanic language that requires this.
p91
aVFor example, most other Germanic language speakers
p92
aVfeel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow
p93
aVby saying, "Morgen regnet es,"
p94
aVquite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."
p95
aa(lp96
VThis led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.
p97
aVCould how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,
p98
aVaffect your propensity to behave across time?
p99
aVYou speak English, a futured language.
p100
aVAnd what that means is that every time you discuss the future,
p101
aVor any kind of a future event,
p102
aVgrammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present
p103
aVand treat it as if it's something viscerally different.
p104
aVNow suppose that that visceral difference
p105
aVmakes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.
p106
aVIf that's true and it makes the future feel
p107
aVlike something more distant and more different from the present,
p108
aVthat's going to make it harder to save.
p109
aVIf, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,
p110
aVthe present and the future, you speak about them identically.
p111
aVIf that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,
p112
aVthat's going to make it easier to save.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow this is a fanciful theory.
p115
aVI'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.
p116
aVBut how would you actually go about testing such a theory?
p117
aVWell, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.
p118
aVAnd interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers
p119
aVsituated all over the world.
p120
aVThis is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.
p121
aVInterestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,
p122
aVthese pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world
p123
aVturn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.
p124
aa(lp125
VJust to give you a hint of that,
p126
aVlet's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.
p127
aVWhat you see is that these bars are systematically taller
p128
aVand systematically shifted to the left
p129
aVcompared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.
p130
aVWhat is the average difference here?
p131
aVFive percentage points of your GDP saved per year.
p132
aVOver 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow while these findings are suggestive,
p135
aVcountries can be different in so many different ways
p136
aVthat it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
p137
aVWhat I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,
p138
aVwhich is trying to gather all of the largest datasets
p139
aVthat we have access to as economists,
p140
aVand I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,
p141
aVhoping to get this relationship to break.
p142
aVAnd just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.
p143
aVLet me show you how far you can do that.
p144
aa(lp145
VOne way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.
p146
aVSo for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.
p147
aVFrom this dataset you actually learn that retired European families
p148
aVare extremely patient with survey takers.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVSo imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.
p151
aV"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?
p152
aVDo you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?
p153
aVWould you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?
p154
aVIf you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?
p155
aVWould you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device
p156
aVso I can measure your grip strength?
p157
aVHow about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"
p158
aVThe survey takes over a day.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVCombine that with a Demographic and Health Survey
p161
aVcollected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,
p162
aVwhich that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status
p163
aVof families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.
p164
aVCombine that with a world value survey,
p165
aVwhich measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors
p166
aVof millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.
p167
aa(lp168
VTake all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.
p169
aVWhat you find is nine countries around the world
p170
aVthat have significant native populations
p171
aVwhich speak both futureless and futured languages.
p172
aVAnd what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs
p173
aVbetween families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,
p174
aVand then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds
p175
aVeven after controlling for all of these levels.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat are the characteristics we can control for?
p178
aVWell I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,
p179
aVthe demographics \u2014 what sex, their age \u2014
p180
aVtheir income level within their own country,
p181
aVtheir educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.
p182
aVIt turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.
p183
aVAnd most granularly, I break them down by religion
p184
aVwhere there are 72 categories of religions in the world \u2014
p185
aVso an extreme level of granularity.
p186
aVThere are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on
p189
aVis only comparing these basically nearly identical families.
p190
aVIt's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment
p191
aVof finding two families both of whom live in Brussels
p192
aVwho are identical on every single one of these dimensions,
p193
aVbut one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;
p194
aVor two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,
p195
aVone of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow even after all of this granular level of control,
p198
aVdo futureless language speakers seem to save more?
p199
aVYes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,
p200
aVare 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.
p201
aVDoes this have cumulative effects?
p202
aVYes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,
p203
aVare going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.
p204
aa(lp205
VCan we push this data even further?
p206
aVYes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.
p207
aVNow how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?
p208
aVWell, think about smoking, for example.
p209
aVSmoking is in some deep sense negative savings.
p210
aVIf savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,
p211
aVsmoking is just the opposite.
p212
aVIt's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.
p213
aVWhat we should expect then is the opposite effect.
p214
aVAnd that's exactly what we find.
p215
aVFutureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely
p216
aVto be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,
p217
aVand they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely
p218
aVto be obese by the time they retire,
p219
aVand they're going to report being 21 percent more likely
p220
aVto have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.
p221
aVI could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.
p222
aVIt's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior
p223
aVfor which this strong effect isn't present.
p224
aa(lp225
VMy linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work
p226
aVand really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges
p227
aVcause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.
p228
aVUltimately, the goal,
p229
aVonce we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,
p230
aVwe want to be able to provide people tools
p231
aVso that they can consciously make themselves better savers
p232
aVand more conscious investors in their own future.
