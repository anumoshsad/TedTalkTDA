VTwo years ago, I have to say there was no problem.
p4
aVTwo years ago, I knew exactly  what an icon looked like.
p5
aVIt looks like this.
p6
aVEverybody's icon, but also the default position
p7
aVof a curator of Italian Renaissance  paintings, which I was then.
p8
aVAnd in a way, this is also another default selection.
p9
aVLeonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image
p10
aVof the "Lady with an Ermine."
p11
aVAnd I use that word, soulful, deliberately.
p12
aVOr then there's this, or rather these:
p13
aVthe two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks"
p14
aVthat were about to come together  in London for the very first time.
p15
aVIn the exhibition that I was then in  the absolute throes of organizing.
p16
aVI was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,
p17
aVand I had been for three years.
p18
aVSo, he was occupying every part of my brain.
p19
aVLeonardo had taught me, during that three years,
p20
aVabout what a picture can do.
p21
aVAbout taking you from your own  material world into a spiritual world.
p22
aVHe said, actually, that he believed  the job of the painter
p23
aVwas to paint everything that was visible  and invisible in the universe.
p24
aVThat's a huge task. And yet,  somehow he achieves it.
p25
aVHe shows us, I think, the human soul.
p26
aVHe shows us the capacity of ourselves
p27
aVto move into a spiritual realm.
p28
aVTo see a vision of the universe that's  more perfect than our own.
p29
aVTo see God's own plan, in some sense.
p30
aVSo this, in a sense, was really  what I believed an icon was.
p31
aa(lp32
VAt about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,
p33
aa(lp34
Vdirector here of the Metropolitan Museum,
p35
aVabout what my next move might be.
p36
aVThe move, in fact, back to an earlier life,
p37
aVone I'd begun at the British Museum,
p38
aVback to the world of three dimensions \u2014
p39
aVof sculpture and of decorative arts \u2014
p40
aVto take over the department of European sculpture  and decorative arts, here at the Met.
p41
aVBut it was an incredibly busy time.
p42
aVAll the conversations were done  at very peculiar times of the day \u2014
p43
aVover the phone.
p44
aVIn the end, I accepted the job
p45
aVwithout actually having been here.
p46
aVAgain, I'd been there a couple of years before,
p47
aVbut on that particular visit.
p48
aVSo, it was just before the time that  the Leonardo show was due to open
p49
aVwhen I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,
p50
aVto see my new domain.
p51
aVTo see what European sculpture  and decorative arts looked like,
p52
aVbeyond those Renaissance collections  with which I was so already familiar.
p53
aVAnd I thought, on that very first day,  I better tour the galleries.
p54
aVFifty-seven of these galleries \u2014
p55
aVlike 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.
p56
aVI walked through and I started in my comfort zone in the Italian Renaissance.
p57
aVAnd then I moved gradually around,
p58
aVfeeling a little lost sometimes.
p59
aVMy head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition
p60
aVthat was about to open, and I came across this.
p61
aVAnd I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?
p62
aVThere was absolutely no connection in my mind
p63
aVat all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,
p64
aVit was a kind of repulsion.
p65
aVThis object felt utterly and completely alien.
p66
aVSilly at a level that I hadn't yet  understood silliness to be.
p67
aVAnd then it was made worse \u2014
p68
aVthere were two of them.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVSo, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,
p71
aVthat I disliked this object so much.
p72
aVWhat was the anatomy of my distaste?
p73
aVWell, so much gold, so vulgar.
p74
aVYou know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
p75
aVLeonardo himself had preached  against the use of gold,
p76
aVso it was absolutely anathema at that moment.
p77
aVAnd then there's little pretty sprigs  of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)
p78
aVAnd finally, that pink. That damned pink.
p79
aVIt's such an extraordinarily artificial color.
p80
aVI mean, it's a color that I can't think of  anything that you actually see in nature,
p81
aVthat looks that shade.
p82
aVThe object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)
p83
aVThis little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit
p84
aVthat sits at the bottom of the vase.
p85
aVIt reminded me, in an odd kind of way,
p86
aVof my niece's fifth birthday party.
p87
aVWhere all the little girls would come  either as a princess or a fairy.
p88
aVThere was one who would come as a fairy princess.
p89
aVYou should have seen the looks.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVAnd I realize that this object was in my mind,
p92
aVborn from the same mind, from the same womb,
p93
aVpractically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)
p94
aVAnd then there's the elephants. (Laughter)
p95
aVThose extraordinary elephants
p96
aVwith their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions
p97
aVand Greta Garbo eyelashes, with  these golden tusks and so on.
p98
aVI realized this was an elephant that had
p99
aVabsolutely nothing to do with a majestic  march across the Serengeti.
p100
aVIt was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VBut something more profound  was happening as well.
p103
aVThese objects, it seemed to me,
p104
aVwere quintessentially the kind that I  and my liberal left friends in London
p105
aVhad always seen as summing up
p106
aVsomething deplorable about the French aristocracy
p107
aVin the 18th century.
p108
aVThe label had told me that these pieces were made
p109
aVby the Sèvres Manufactory,
p110
aVmade of porcelain in the late 1750s,
p111
aVand designed by a designer called  Jean-Claude Duplessis,
p112
aVactually somebody of extraordinary distinction
p113
aVas I later learned.
p114
aVBut for me, they summed up a kind of,
p115
aVthat sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy
p116
aVin the 18th century.
p117
aVI and my colleagues had always thought
p118
aVthat these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,
p119
aVyou know \u2014 no wonder there was a revolution.
p120
aVOr, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.
p121
aVThere was a sort of idea really, that,
p122
aVif you owned a vase like this,
p123
aVthen there was really only one fate possible.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, there I was \u2014 in a sort of paroxysm of horror.
p127
aVBut I took the job and I went  on looking at these vases.
p128
aVI sort of had to because they're  on a through route in the Met.
p129
aVSo, almost anywhere I went, there they were.
p130
aVThey had this kind of odd sort of fascination,
p131
aVlike a car accident.
p132
aVWhere I couldn't stop looking.
p133
aVAnd as I did so, I started thinking:
p134
aVWell, what are we actually looking at here?
p135
aVAnd what I started with was understanding this
p136
aVas really a supreme piece of design.
p137
aVIt took me a little time.
p138
aVBut, that tutu for example \u2014
p139
aVactually, this is a piece that  does dance in its own way.
p140
aVIt has an extraordinary lightness
p141
aVand yet, it is also amazing balanced.
p142
aVIt has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.
p143
aVAnd then the play between \u2014
p144
aVactually really quite carefully disposed  color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,
p145
aVis really rather remarkable.
p146
aVAnd then I realized that this piece went into the kiln
p147
aVfour times, at least four times  in order to arrive at this.
p148
aVHow many moments for accident can you think of
p149
aVthat could have happened to this piece?
p150
aVAnd then remember, not just one, but two.
p151
aVSo he's having to arrive at two exactly matched
p152
aVvases of this kind.
p153
aVAnd then this question of uselessness.
p154
aVWell actually, the end of the trunks  were originally candle holders.
p155
aVSo what you would have had  were candles on either side.
p156
aVImagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.
p157
aVOn the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.
p158
aVIt would have glittered in an interior,
p159
aVa little like a little firework.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd at that point, actually,  a firework went off in my brain.
p162
aVSomebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' \u2014
p163
aVwhich in a sense for me, encapsulated this object \u2014
p164
aVactually comes from the same  root as the word 'fantasy.'
p165
aVAnd that what this object was just as much in a way,
p166
aVin its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,
p167
aVis a portal to somewhere else.
p168
aVThis is an object of the imagination.
p169
aVIf you think about the mad 18th-century  operas of the time \u2014 set in the Orient.
p170
aVIf you think about divans and perhaps even  opium-induced visions of pink elephants,
p171
aVthen at that point, this object starts to make sense.
p172
aVThis is an object which is all about escapism.
p173
aVIt's about an escapism that happens \u2014
p174
aVthat the aristocracy in France sought
p175
aVvery deliberately
p176
aVto distinguish themselves from ordinary people.
p177
aa(lp178
VIt's not an escapism that
p179
aVwe feel particularly happy with today, however.
p180
aVAnd again, going on thinking about this,
p181
aVI realize that in a way we're all victims
p182
aVof a certain kind of tyranny
p183
aVof the triumph of modernism
p184
aVwhereby form and function in an object
p185
aVhave to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.
p186
aVAnd the extraneous ornament is seen as really,
p187
aVessentially, criminal.
p188
aVIt's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones.
p189
aVAnd that seems fine.
p190
aVExcept for the fact that it becomes a kind of  sequestration of imagination.
p191
aVSo just as in the 20th century, so many people
p192
aVhad the idea that their faith
p193
aVtook place on the Sabbath day,
p194
aVand the rest of their lives \u2014
p195
aVtheir lives of washing machines and orthodontics \u2014
p196
aVtook place on another day.
p197
aVThen, I think we've started doing the same.
p198
aVWe've allowed ourselves to
p199
aVlead our fantasy lives in front of screens.
p200
aVIn the dark of the cinema, with the television in the corner of the room.
p201
aVWe've eliminated, in a sense, that constant
p202
aVof the imagination that these vases  represented in people's lives.
p203
aVSo maybe it's time we got this back a little.
p204
aVI think it's beginning to happen.
p205
aVIn London, for example,
p206
aVwith these extraordinary buildings
p207
aVthat have been appearing over the last few years.
p208
aVRedolent, in a sense, of science fiction,
p209
aVturning London into a kind of fantasy playground.
p210
aVIt's actually amazing to look out of  a high building nowadays there.
p211
aVBut even then, there's a resistance.
p212
aVLondon has called these buildings the  Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie \u2014
p213
aVbringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.
p214
aVThere's an idea that we don't want these
p215
aVanxious-making, imaginative journeys  to happen in our daily lives.
p216
aVI feel lucky in a way,
p217
aVI've encountered this object.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVI found him on the Internet when  I was looking up a reference.
p220
aVAnd there he was.
p221
aVAnd unlike the pink elephant vase,
p222
aVthis was a kind of love at first sight.
p223
aVIn fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.
p224
aVAnd he now adorns my office.
p225
aVHe's a Staffordshire figure made  in the middle of the 19th century.
p226
aVHe represents the actor, Edmund Kean,  playing Shakespeare's Richard III.
p227
aVAnd it's based, actually, on a more  elevated piece of porcelain.
p228
aVSo I loved, on an art historical level,
p229
aVI loved that layered quality that he has.
p230
aVBut more than that, I love him.
p231
aVIn a way that I think would have been impossible
p232
aVwithout the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.
p233
aVI love his orange and pink breeches.
p234
aVI love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,
p235
aVhaving just finished the washing up. (Laughter)
p236
aVHe seems also to have forgotten his sword.
p237
aVI love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.
p238
aVIn a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.
p239
aVHe's, I hope, a little bit dignified,
p240
aVbut mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)
p241
aVAnd energetic, I hope, too.
p242
aVI let him into my life because the Sèvres pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.
p243
aVAnd before that Leonardo,
p244
aVI understood that this object could become  part of a journey for me every day,
p245
aVsitting in my office.
p246
aVI really hope that others, all of you,
p247
aVvisiting objects in the museum,
p248
aVand taking them home and  finding them for yourselves,
p249
aVwill allow those objects to flourish  in your imaginative lives.
p250
aVThank you very much.
