VWhat is going on
p4
aVin this baby's mind?
p5
aVIf you'd asked people this 30 years ago,
p6
aVmost people, including psychologists,
p7
aVwould have said that this baby was irrational,
p8
aVillogical, egocentric \u2014
p9
aVthat he couldn't take the perspective of another person
p10
aVor understand cause and effect.
p11
aVIn the last 20 years,
p12
aVdevelopmental science has completely overturned that picture.
p13
aVSo in some ways,
p14
aVwe think that this baby's thinking
p15
aVis like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.
p16
aa(lp17
VLet me give you just one example of this.
p18
aVOne thing that this baby could be thinking about,
p19
aVthat could be going on in his mind,
p20
aVis trying to figure out
p21
aVwhat's going on in the mind of that other baby.
p22
aVAfter all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do
p23
aVis to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.
p24
aVAnd maybe the hardest thing of all
p25
aVis to figure out that what other people think and feel
p26
aVisn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.
p27
aVAnyone who's followed politics can testify
p28
aVto how hard that is for some people to get.
p29
aVWe wanted to know
p30
aVif babies and young children
p31
aVcould understand this really profound thing about other people.
p32
aVNow the question is: How could we ask them?
p33
aVBabies, after all, can't talk,
p34
aVand if you ask a three year-old
p35
aVto tell you what he thinks,
p36
aVwhat you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue
p37
aVabout ponies and birthdays and things like that.
p38
aVSo how do we actually ask them the question?
p39
aa(lp40
VWell it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
p41
aVWhat we did \u2014 Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I \u2014
p42
aVwas actually to give the babies two bowls of food:
p43
aVone bowl of raw broccoli
p44
aVand one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.
p45
aVNow all of the babies, even in Berkley,
p46
aVlike the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVBut then what Betty did
p49
aVwas to take a little taste of food from each bowl.
p50
aVAnd she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.
p51
aVSo half the time, she acted
p52
aVas if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli \u2014
p53
aVjust like a baby and any other sane person.
p54
aVBut half the time,
p55
aVwhat she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli
p56
aVand go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.
p57
aVI tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
p58
aVAnd then she would take a little bit of the crackers,
p59
aVand she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.
p60
aVI tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."
p61
aVSo she'd act as if what she wanted
p62
aVwas just the opposite of what the babies wanted.
p63
aVWe did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
p64
aVAnd then she would simply put her hand out and say,
p65
aV"Can you give me some?"
p66
aa(lp67
VSo the question is: What would the baby give her,
p68
aVwhat they liked or what she liked?
p69
aVAnd the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,
p70
aVjust barely walking and talking,
p71
aVwould give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,
p72
aVbut they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.
p73
aVOn the other hand,
p74
aV15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time
p75
aVif she acted as if she liked the broccoli,
p76
aVlike they couldn't figure this out.
p77
aVBut then after they stared for a long time,
p78
aVthey would just give her the crackers,
p79
aVwhat they thought everybody must like.
p80
aVSo there are two really remarkable things about this.
p81
aVThe first one is that these little 18 month-old babies
p82
aVhave already discovered
p83
aVthis really profound fact about human nature,
p84
aVthat we don't always want the same thing.
p85
aVAnd what's more, they felt that they should actually do things
p86
aVto help other people get what they wanted.
p87
aa(lp88
VEven more remarkably though,
p89
aVthe fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this
p90
aVsuggests that these 18 month-olds had learned
p91
aVthis deep, profound fact about human nature
p92
aVin the three months from when they were 15 months old.
p93
aVSo children both know more and learn more
p94
aVthan we ever would have thought.
p95
aVAnd this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years
p96
aVthat's actually demonstrated it.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe question you might ask though is:
p99
aVWhy do children learn so much?
p100
aVAnd how is it possible for them to learn so much
p101
aVin such a short time?
p102
aVI mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,
p103
aVthey seem pretty useless.
p104
aVAnd actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,
p105
aVbecause we have to put so much time and energy
p106
aVinto just keeping them alive.
p107
aVBut if we turn to evolution
p108
aVfor an answer to this puzzle
p109
aVof why we spend so much time
p110
aVtaking care of useless babies,
p111
aVit turns out that there's actually an answer.
p112
aVIf we look across many, many different species of animals,
p113
aVnot just us primates,
p114
aVbut also including other mammals, birds,
p115
aVeven marsupials
p116
aVlike kangaroos and wombats,
p117
aVit turns out that there's a relationship
p118
aVbetween how long a childhood a species has
p119
aVand how big their brains are compared to their bodies
p120
aVand how smart and flexible they are.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.
p123
aVOn one side
p124
aVis a New Caledonian crow.
p125
aVAnd crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,
p126
aVare incredibly smart birds.
p127
aVThey're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
p128
aVAnd this is a bird on the cover of science
p129
aVwho's learned how to use a tool to get food.
p130
aVOn the other hand,
p131
aVwe have our friend the domestic chicken.
p132
aVAnd chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys
p133
aVare basically as dumb as dumps.
p134
aVSo they're very, very good at pecking for grain,
p135
aVand they're not much good at doing anything else.
p136
aVWell it turns out that the babies,
p137
aVthe New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.
p138
aVThey depend on their moms
p139
aVto drop worms in their little open mouths
p140
aVfor as long as two years,
p141
aVwhich is a really long time in the life of a bird.
p142
aVWhereas the chickens are actually mature
p143
aVwithin a couple of months.
p144
aVSo childhood is the reason
p145
aVwhy the crows end up on the cover of Science
p146
aVand the chickens end up in the soup pot.
p147
aa(lp148
VThere's something about that long childhood
p149
aVthat seems to be connected
p150
aVto knowledge and learning.
p151
aVWell what kind of explanation could we have for this?
p152
aVWell some animals, like the chicken,
p153
aVseem to be beautifully suited
p154
aVto doing just one thing very well.
p155
aVSo they seem to be beautifully suited
p156
aVto pecking grain in one environment.
p157
aVOther creatures, like the crows,
p158
aVaren't very good at doing anything in particular,
p159
aVbut they're extremely good
p160
aVat learning about laws of different environments.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd of course, we human beings
p163
aVare way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.
p164
aVWe have bigger brains relative to our bodies
p165
aVby far than any other animal.
p166
aVWe're smarter, we're more flexible,
p167
aVwe can learn more,
p168
aVwe survive in more different environments,
p169
aVwe migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.
p170
aVAnd our babies and children are dependent on us
p171
aVfor much longer than the babies of any other species.
p172
aVMy son is 23.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVAnd at least until they're 23,
p175
aVwe're still popping those worms
p176
aVinto those little open mouths.
p177
aa(lp178
VAll right, why would we see this correlation?
p179
aVWell an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,
p180
aVis an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,
p181
aVbut it has one big disadvantage.
p182
aVAnd that one big disadvantage
p183
aVis that, until you actually do all that learning,
p184
aVyou're going to be helpless.
p185
aVSo you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you
p186
aVand be saying to yourself,
p187
aV"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"
p188
aVYou want to know all that
p189
aVbefore the mastodons actually show up.
p190
aVAnd the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem
p191
aVis with a kind of division of labor.
p192
aVSo the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.
p193
aVWe don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.
p194
aVAnd then as adults,
p195
aVwe can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children
p196
aVand actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo one way of thinking about it
p199
aVis that babies and young children
p200
aVare like the research and development division of the human species.
p201
aVSo they're the protected blue sky guys
p202
aVwho just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,
p203
aVand we're production and marketing.
p204
aVWe have to take all those ideas
p205
aVthat we learned when we were children
p206
aVand actually put them to use.
p207
aVAnother way of thinking about it
p208
aVis instead of thinking of babies and children
p209
aVas being like defective grownups,
p210
aVwe should think about them
p211
aVas being a different developmental stage of the same species \u2014
p212
aVkind of like caterpillars and butterflies \u2014
p213
aVexcept that they're actually the brilliant butterflies
p214
aVwho are flitting around the garden and exploring,
p215
aVand we're the caterpillars
p216
aVwho are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.
p217
aa(lp218
VIf this is true, if these babies are designed to learn \u2014
p219
aVand this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,
p220
aVthat's what they're for \u2014
p221
aVwe might expect
p222
aVthat they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.
p223
aVAnd in fact, the baby's brain
p224
aVseems to be the most powerful learning computer
p225
aVon the planet.
p226
aVBut real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.
p227
aVAnd there's been a revolution
p228
aVin our understanding of machine learning recently.
p229
aVAnd it all depends on the ideas of this guy,
p230
aVthe Reverend Thomas Bayes,
p231
aVwho was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.
p232
aVAnd essentially what Bayes did
p233
aVwas to provide a mathematical way
p234
aVusing probability theory
p235
aVto characterize, describe,
p236
aVthe way that scientists find out about the world.
p237
aVSo what scientists do
p238
aVis they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.
p239
aVThey go out and test it against the evidence.
p240
aVThe evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
p241
aVThen they test that new hypothesis
p242
aVand so on and so forth.
p243
aVAnd what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.
p244
aVAnd that mathematics is at the core
p245
aVof the best machine learning programs that we have now.
p246
aVAnd some 10 years ago,
p247
aVI suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo if you want to know what's going on
p250
aVunderneath those beautiful brown eyes,
p251
aVI think it actually looks something like this.
p252
aVThis is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
p253
aVSo I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations
p254
aVwith conditional probabilities that they're revising
p255
aVto figure out how the world works.
p256
aVAll right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.
p257
aVBecause after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,
p258
aVthey look extremely stupid.
p259
aVHow could it be that children are doing statistics?
p260
aa(lp261
VSo to test this we used a machine that we have
p262
aVcalled the Blicket Detector.
p263
aVThis is a box that lights up and plays music
p264
aVwhen you put some things on it and not others.
p265
aVAnd using this very simple machine,
p266
aVmy lab and others have done dozens of studies
p267
aVshowing just how good babies are
p268
aVat learning about the world.
p269
aVLet me mention just one
p270
aVthat we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.
p271
aVIf I showed you this detector,
p272
aVyou would be likely to think to begin with
p273
aVthat the way to make the detector go
p274
aVwould be to put a block on top of the detector.
p275
aVBut actually, this detector
p276
aVworks in a bit of a strange way.
p277
aVBecause if you wave a block over the top of the detector,
p278
aVsomething you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,
p279
aVthe detector will actually activate two out of three times.
p280
aVWhereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,
p281
aVit will only activate two out of six times.
p282
aVSo the unlikely hypothesis
p283
aVactually has stronger evidence.
p284
aVIt looks as if the waving
p285
aVis a more effective strategy than the other strategy.
p286
aVSo we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,
p287
aVand we just asked them to make it go.
p288
aVAnd sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence
p289
aVto wave the object on top of the detector.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow there are two things that are really interesting about this.
p292
aVThe first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.
p293
aVThey're just learning how to count.
p294
aVBut unconsciously,
p295
aVthey're doing these quite complicated calculations
p296
aVthat will give them a conditional probability measure.
p297
aVAnd the other interesting thing
p298
aVis that they're using that evidence
p299
aVto get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,
p300
aVthat seems very unlikely to begin with.
p301
aVAnd in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,
p302
aVwe've show that four year-olds are actually better
p303
aVat finding out an unlikely hypothesis
p304
aVthan adults are when we give them exactly the same task.
p305
aVSo in these circumstances,
p306
aVthe children are using statistics to find out about the world,
p307
aVbut after all, scientists also do experiments,
p308
aVand we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.
p309
aVWhen children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"
p310
aVor else "playing."
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently
p313
aVthat have shown this playing around
p314
aVis really a kind of experimental research program.
p315
aVHere's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
p316
aVWhat Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
p317
aVAnd what she did was show children
p318
aVthat yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,
p319
aVand then she showed them an anomaly.
p320
aVAnd what you'll see
p321
aVis that this little boy will go through five hypotheses
p322
aVin the space of two minutes.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Video) Boy: How about this?
p325
aVSame as the other side.
p326
aa(lp327
VAlison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VBoy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
p332
aa(lp333
VAG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
p334
aa(lp335
VBoy: What's making this light up.
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aVI don't know.
p338
aa(lp339
VAG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VBoy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,
p344
aVand this needs to be like this.
p345
aa(lp346
VAG: Okay, hypothesis two.
p347
aa(lp348
VBoy: That's why.
p349
aVOh.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAG: Now this is his next idea.
p354
aVHe told the experimenter to do this,
p355
aVto try putting it out onto the other location.
p356
aVNot working either.
p357
aa(lp358
VBoy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,
p359
aVnot here.
p360
aVOh, the bottom of this box
p361
aVhas electricity in here,
p362
aVbut this doesn't have electricity.
p363
aa(lp364
VAG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
p365
aa(lp366
VBoy: It's lighting up.
p367
aVSo when you put four.
p368
aVSo you put four on this one to make it light up
p369
aVand two on this one to make it light up.
p370
aa(lp371
VAG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.
p372
aa(lp373
VNow that is a particularly \u2014
p374
aVthat is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,
p375
aVbut what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.
p376
aVIf you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,
p377
aVwhat they really do is do a series of experiments.
p378
aVThis is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.
p379
aa(lp380
VWell, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
p381
aVWhat's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies
p382
aVwho can test five hypotheses in two minutes?
p383
aVWell, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,
p384
aVa lot of them have said
p385
aVthat babies and young children were barely conscious
p386
aVif they were conscious at all.
p387
aVAnd I think just the opposite is true.
p388
aVI think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.
p389
aVNow here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.
p390
aVAnd adults' attention and consciousness
p391
aVlook kind of like a spotlight.
p392
aVSo what happens for adults
p393
aVis we decide that something's relevant or important,
p394
aVwe should pay attention to it.
p395
aVOur consciousness of that thing that we're attending to
p396
aVbecomes extremely bright and vivid,
p397
aVand everything else sort of goes dark.
p398
aVAnd we even know something about the way the brain does this.
p399
aa(lp400
VSo what happens when we pay attention
p401
aVis that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,
p402
aVsends a signal
p403
aVthat makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,
p404
aVmore plastic, better at learning,
p405
aVand shuts down activity
p406
aVin all the rest of our brains.
p407
aVSo we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.
p408
aVIf we look at babies and young children,
p409
aVwe see something very different.
p410
aVI think babies and young children
p411
aVseem to have more of a lantern of consciousness
p412
aVthan a spotlight of consciousness.
p413
aVSo babies and young children are very bad
p414
aVat narrowing down to just one thing.
p415
aVBut they're very good at taking in lots of information
p416
aVfrom lots of different sources at once.
p417
aVAnd if you actually look in their brains,
p418
aVyou see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters
p419
aVthat are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,
p420
aVand the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.
p421
aVSo when we say that babies and young children
p422
aVare bad at paying attention,
p423
aVwhat we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.
p424
aVSo they're bad at getting rid
p425
aVof all the interesting things that could tell them something
p426
aVand just looking at the thing that's important.
p427
aVThat's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,
p428
aVthat we might expect
p429
aVfrom those butterflies who are designed to learn.
p430
aa(lp431
VWell if we want to think about a way
p432
aVof getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,
p433
aVI think the best thing is think about cases
p434
aVwhere we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before \u2014
p435
aVwhen we fall in love with someone new,
p436
aVor when we're in a new city for the first time.
p437
aVAnd what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,
p438
aVit expands,
p439
aVso that those three days in Paris
p440
aVseem to be more full of consciousness and experience
p441
aVthan all the months of being
p442
aVa walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
p443
aVAnd by the way, that coffee,
p444
aVthat wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,
p445
aVactually mimics the effect
p446
aVof those baby neurotransmitters.
p447
aVSo what's it like to be a baby?
p448
aVIt's like being in love
p449
aVin Paris for the first time
p450
aVafter you've had three double-espressos.
p451
aV(Laughter)
p452
aVThat's a fantastic way to be,
p453
aVbut it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.
p454
aa(lp455
V(Laughter)
p456
aa(lp457
VNow it's good to be a grownup.
p458
aVI don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.
p459
aVIt's good to be a grownup.
