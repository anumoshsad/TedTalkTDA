VStephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.
p4
aVCan you tell everybody your name?
p5
aa(lp6
VEinstein: Einstein.
p7
aa(lp8
VSW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?
p9
aa(lp10
VE: Hello.
p11
aa(lp12
VSW: That's nice. Can you be polite?
p13
aa(lp14
VE: Hi, sweetheart.
p15
aa(lp16
VSW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,
p17
aVamongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.
p18
aa(lp19
VE: Woo.
p20
aa(lp21
VSW: Yeah.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVSince we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about
p24
aVall the exciting speakers here for the conference.
p25
aVThis morning we've heard a lot of whispers about
p26
aVTom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?
p27
aa(lp28
VE: [Squawks]
p29
aa(lp30
VSW: Yeah.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVEinstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.
p33
aVA lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.
p34
aa(lp35
VE: Achoo!
p36
aa(lp37
VSW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her research
p38
aVcould help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.
p39
aa(lp40
VEinstein: [Coughs]
p41
aa(lp42
VSW: Yeah.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVWell, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes
p45
aVin his research at the microscopic level.
p46
aVWell, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping
p47
aVis that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.
p48
aa(lp49
VE: Oh, my God! My God! My God!
p50
aa(lp51
VSW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVThat is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird,
p54
aVshe's very interested in things that fly.
p55
aVShe thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.
p56
aa(lp57
VE: Ooh.
p58
aa(lp59
VSW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.
p60
aa(lp61
VEinstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?
p62
aVE: [Spaceship noise]
p63
aVSW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?
p64
aa(lp65
VE: [Laser noise]
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VSW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.
p69
aVNow, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves
p70
aVand travelling through space \u2014 it's all very dangerous jobs.
p71
aVIt would be very dangerous if you fell down.
p72
aa(lp73
VE: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]
p74
aa(lp75
VSW: Yeah.
p76
aV(Laughter)
p77
aVLittle splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?
p78
aa(lp79
VE: Ow, ow, ow.
p80
aa(lp81
VSW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.
p82
aa(lp83
VE: [Squawks]
p84
aa(lp85
VSW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.
p86
aa(lp87
VE: [Squawks]
p88
aa(lp89
VSW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job
p90
aVeducating the public, she loves to take in the arts.
p91
aVIf the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,
p92
aVEinstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.
p93
aVCan you get down?
p94
aVE: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)
p95
aVSW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.
p96
aVShe's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.
p97
aa(lp98
VEinstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
p99
aa(lp100
VSW: Do your head now.
p101
aa(lp102
VE: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias
p106
aVon her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?
p107
aa(lp108
VE: [Operatic squawk]
p109
aa(lp110
VSW: Very good.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVOr maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?
p113
aVEinstein, can you also sing?
p114
aVI know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?
p115
aa(lp116
VE: La, la.
p117
aa(lp118
VSW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails,
p119
aVyou can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.
p120
aa(lp121
VE: [Squawks]
p122
aa(lp123
VSW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,
p124
aVbut she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.
p125
aa(lp126
VE: What's the matter?
p127
aa(lp128
VSW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?
p129
aVYou were saying that you were really embarrassed,
p130
aVbecause you're in love with a pirate?
p131
aa(lp132
VE: Yar.
p133
aa(lp134
VSW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?
p135
aa(lp136
VE: Beer.
p137
aVSW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.
p138
aVYou like to drink water.
p139
aa(lp140
VE: [Water sound]
p141
aa(lp142
VSW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.
p143
aVBecause one of her favorite folks from back home is here,
p144
aVand she's pretty nervous to meet him.
p145
aVShe thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.
p146
aVWhat do you say to a good-looking man?
p147
aa(lp148
VE: Hey, baby.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.
p152
aa(lp153
VE: Yee haw.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VSW: And since she's such a big fan,
p157
aVshe knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.
p158
aVAnd we didn't think he'd be in town then,
p159
aVso Einstein wanted to do something special for him.
p160
aVSo let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.
p161
aVCan you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?
p162
aa(lp163
VE: Happy birthday to you.
p164
aa(lp165
VSW: Again.
p166
aa(lp167
VE: Happy birthday to you.
p168
aa(lp169
VSW: Again.
p170
aa(lp171
VE: Happy birthday to you.
p172
aa(lp173
VSW: Big finish.
p174
aa(lp175
VE: Happy birthday to you.
p176
aa(lp177
VSW: Good job!
p178
aV(Applause)
p179
aVWell, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out
p180
aVto all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.
p181
aVEinstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?
p182
aa(lp183
VE: Woo, woo, woo.
p184
aa(lp185
VSW: What about the other birds?
p186
aa(lp187
VE: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
p188
aa(lp189
VSW: And the penguin?
p190
aa(lp191
VE: Quack, quack, quack.
p192
aVSW: There we go.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVLet's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?
p195
aa(lp196
VE: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.
p197
aa(lp198
VSW: Very good.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVWhat about a wolf?
p201
aa(lp202
VE: Ooooowww.
p203
aa(lp204
VSW: And a pig?
p205
aa(lp206
VE: Oink, oink, oink.
p207
aa(lp208
VSW: And the rooster?
p209
aa(lp210
VE: Cock-a-doodle-doo!
p211
aa(lp212
VSW: And how about those cats?
p213
aa(lp214
VE: Meow.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VSW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.
p218
aa(lp219
VE: Grrrrr.
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VSW: What about a skunk?
p223
aa(lp224
VE: Stinker.
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VSW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?
p228
aa(lp229
VE: Superstar.
p230
aa(lp231
VSW: Yeah. You are a superstar.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVWell, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part
p234
aVto help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part
p235
aVto help protect their homes that they live [in].
p236
aVNow, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.
p237
aVWhy do we want to protect your home?
p238
aa(lp239
VE: I'm special.
p240
aa(lp241
VSW: You are very special. What would you like to say
p242
aVto all these nice people?
p243
aa(lp244
VE: I love you.
p245
aa(lp246
VSW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?
p247
aa(lp248
VE: [Kissing noise]
p249
aa(lp250
VSW: And what do you say when it's time to go?
p251
aa(lp252
VE: Goodbye.
p253
aa(lp254
VSW: Good job. Thank you all.
