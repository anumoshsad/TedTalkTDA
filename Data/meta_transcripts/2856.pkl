VSo in 2011, I altered my name
p4
aVso that I could participate in Far Right youth camp in Hungary.
p5
aVI was doing a PhD looking at youth political socialization \u2014
p6
aVwhy young people were developing political ideologies
p7
aVin a post-communist setting,
p8
aVand I saw that a lot of young people I was talking to
p9
aVwere joining the Far Right,
p10
aVand this was astounding to me.
p11
aVSo I wanted to enroll in this youth camp
p12
aVto get a better understanding of why people were joining.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo a colleague enrolled me,
p15
aVand my last name sounds a little bit too Jewish.
p16
aVSo Erin got turned into Iréna,
p17
aVand Saltman got turned into Sós,
p18
aVwhich means "salty" in Hungarian.
p19
aVAnd in Hungarian, your last name goes first,
p20
aVso my James Bond name turned into "Salty Irena,"
p21
aVwhich is not something I would have naturally chosen for myself.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut going to this camp,
p24
aVI was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun.
p25
aVThey talked very little about politics.
p26
aVIt was mostly learning how to ride horses,
p27
aVshooting a bow and arrow,
p28
aVlive music at night,
p29
aVfree food and alcohol,
p30
aValso some air-gun target practice
p31
aVusing mainstream politicians' faces as targets.
p32
aVAnd this seemed like a very, actually, friendly, inclusive group
p33
aVuntil you started talking or mentioning anything to do with the Roma population,
p34
aVJewish people or immigrants,
p35
aVand then the discourse would become very hate-based very quickly.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo it led me into my work now,
p38
aVwhere we pose the question,
p39
aV"Why do people join violent extremist movements,
p40
aVand how do we effectively counter these processes?"
p41
aVIn the aftermath of horrible atrocities and attacks
p42
aVin places like Belgium, France, but all over the world,
p43
aVsometimes it's easier for us to think,
p44
aV"Well, these must be sociopaths,
p45
aVthese must be naturally violent individuals.
p46
aVThey must have something wrong with their upbringing."
p47
aVAnd what's really tragic
p48
aVis that oftentimes there's no one profile.
p49
aVMany people come from educated backgrounds,
p50
aVdifferent socioeconomic backgrounds,
p51
aVmen and women, different ages,
p52
aVsome with families, some single.
p53
aVSo why? What is this allure?
p54
aVAnd this is what I want to talk you through,
p55
aVas well as how do we challenge this in a modern era?
p56
aa(lp57
VWe do know, through research,
p58
aVthat there are quite a number of different things
p59
aVthat affect somebody's process of radicalization,
p60
aVand we categorize these into push and pull factors.
p61
aVAnd these are pretty much similar for Far Right, neo-Nazi groups
p62
aVall the way to Islamist extremist and terrorist groups.
p63
aVAnd push factors are basically what makes you vulnerable
p64
aVto a process of radicalization,
p65
aVto joining a violent extremist group.
p66
aVAnd these can be a lot of different things,
p67
aVbut roughly, a sense of alienation, a sense of isolation,
p68
aVquestioning your own identity,
p69
aVbut also feeling that your in-group is under attack,
p70
aVand your in group might be based on a nationality or an ethnicity
p71
aVor a religion,
p72
aVand feeling that larger powers around you are doing nothing to help.
p73
aa(lp74
VNow, push factors alone do not make you a violent extremist,
p75
aVbecause if that were the fact,
p76
aVthose same factors would go towards a group like the Roma population,
p77
aVand they're not a violently mobilized group.
p78
aVSo we have to look at the pull factors.
p79
aVWhat are these violent extremist organizations offering
p80
aVthat other groups are not offering?
p81
aVAnd actually, this is usually very positive things,
p82
aVvery seemingly empowering things,
p83
aVsuch as brotherhood and sisterhood
p84
aVand a sense of belonging,
p85
aVas well as giving somebody a spiritual purpose,
p86
aVa divine purpose to build a utopian society
p87
aVif their goals can be met,
p88
aVbut also a sense of empowerment and adventure.
p89
aa(lp90
VWhen we look at foreign terrorist fighters,
p91
aVwe see young men with the wind in their hair
p92
aVout in the desert and women going to join them
p93
aVto have nuptials out in the sunset.
p94
aVIt's very romantic, and you become a hero.
p95
aVFor both men and women, that's the propaganda being given.
p96
aVSo what extremist groups are very good at
p97
aVis taking a very complicated, confusing, nuanced world
p98
aVand simplifying that world into black and white,
p99
aVgood and evil.
p100
aVAnd you become what is good,
p101
aVchallenging what is evil.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo I want to talk a little bit about ISIS, Daesh,
p104
aVbecause they have been a game changer in how we look at these processes,
p105
aVand through a lot of the material and their tactics.
p106
aVThey're very much a modern movement.
p107
aVOne of the aspects is the internet and the usage of social media,
p108
aVas we've all seen in headlines tweeting and videos of beheadings.
p109
aVBut the internet alone does not radicalize you.
p110
aVThe internet is a tool.
p111
aVYou don't go online shopping for shoes
p112
aVand accidentally become a jihadist.
p113
aVHowever, what the Internet does do is it is a catalyst.
p114
aa(lp115
VIt provides tools and scale and rapidity
p116
aVthat doesn't exist elsewhere.
p117
aVAnd with ISIS, all of a sudden,
p118
aVthis idea of a cloaked, dark figure of a jihadist changed for us.
p119
aVAll of a sudden, we were in their kitchens.
p120
aVWe saw what they were eating for dinner.
p121
aVThey were tweeting.
p122
aVWe had foreign terrorist fighters tweeting in their own languages.
p123
aVWe had women going out there talking about their wedding day,
p124
aVabout the births of their children.
p125
aVWe had gaming culture, all of a sudden,
p126
aVand references to Grand Theft Auto being made.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo all of a sudden, they were homey.
p129
aVThey became human.
p130
aVAnd the problem is that trying to counter it,
p131
aVlots of governments and social media companies
p132
aVjust tried to censor.
p133
aVHow do we get rid of terrorist content?
p134
aVAnd it became a cat-and-mouse game
p135
aVwhere we would see accounts taken down and they'd just come back up,
p136
aVand an arrogance around somebody having a 25th account
p137
aVand material that was disseminated everywhere.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut we also saw a dangerous trend \u2014
p140
aVviolent extremists know the rules and regulations of social media, too.
p141
aVSo we would see a banal conversation with a recruiter
p142
aVstart on a mainstream platform,
p143
aVand at the point at which that conversation
p144
aVwas going to become illegal,
p145
aVthey would jump to a smaller, less regulated,
p146
aVmore encrypted platform.
p147
aVSo all of a sudden, we couldn't track where that conversation went.
p148
aVSo this is a problem with censorship,
p149
aVwhich is why we need to develop alternatives to censorship.
p150
aa(lp151
VISIS is also a game-changer because it's state-building.
p152
aVIt's not just recruiting combatants;
p153
aVit's trying to build a state.
p154
aVAnd what that means is all of a sudden,
p155
aVyour recruitment model is much more broad.
p156
aVYou're not just trying to get fighters \u2014
p157
aVnow you need architects, engineers, accountants, hackers and women.
p158
aVWe've actually seen a huge increase of women going
p159
aVin the last 24, but especially 12 months.
p160
aVSome countries, one in four of the people going over to join
p161
aVare now women.
p162
aVAnd so, this really changes
p163
aVwho we're trying to counter this process with.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, not all doom and gloom.
p166
aVSo the rest I'd like to talk about some of the positive things
p167
aVand the new innovation in trying to prevent and counter violent extremism.
p168
aa(lp169
VPreventing is very different than countering,
p170
aVand actually, you can think of it in medical terms.
p171
aVSo preventative medicine is,
p172
aVhow do we make it so you are naturally resilient
p173
aVto this process of radicalization,
p174
aVwhereas that is going to be different
p175
aVif somebody is already showing a symptom or a sign
p176
aVof belonging to a violent extremist ideology.
p177
aVAnd so in preventative measures,
p178
aVwe're talking more about really broad groups of people
p179
aVand exposure to ideas
p180
aVto make them resilient.
p181
aVWhereas it's very different
p182
aVif somebody is starting to question and agree with certain things online,
p183
aVand it's also very different if somebody already has a swastika tattoo
p184
aVand is very much embedded within a group.
p185
aVHow do you reach them?
p186
aa(lp187
VSo I'd like to go through three examples of each one of those levels
p188
aVand talk you through
p189
aVwhat some of the new ways of engaging with people are becoming.
p190
aa(lp191
VOne is "Extreme Dialogue,"
p192
aVand it's an educational program that we helped develop.
p193
aVThis one is from Canada,
p194
aVand it's meant to create dialogues within a classroom setting,
p195
aVusing storytelling,
p196
aVbecause violent extremism can be very hard to try to explain,
p197
aVespecially to younger individuals.
p198
aVSo we have a network of former extremists and survivors of extremism
p199
aVthat tell their stories through video and create question-giving to classrooms,
p200
aVto start a conversation about the topic.
p201
aa(lp202
VThese two examples show Christianne,
p203
aVwho lost her son,
p204
aVwho radicalized and died fighting for ISIS,
p205
aVand Daniel is a former neo-Nazi
p206
aVwho was an extremely violent neo-Nazi,
p207
aVand they pose questions about their lives and where they're at and regret,
p208
aVand force a classroom to have a dialogue around it.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, looking at that middle range of individuals,
p211
aVactually, we need a lot of civil society voices.
p212
aVHow do you interact with people that are looking for information online,
p213
aVthat are starting to toy with an ideology,
p214
aVthat are doing those searching identity questions?
p215
aVHow do we provide alternatives for that?
p216
aVAnd that's when we combine large groups of civil society voices
p217
aVwith creatives, techies, app developers, artists, comedians,
p218
aVand we can create really specified content
p219
aVand actually, online, disseminate it to very strategic audiences.
p220
aVSo one example would be creating a satirical video
p221
aVwhich makes fun of Islamophobia,
p222
aVand targeting it to 15- to 20-year-olds online
p223
aVthat have an interest in white power music
p224
aVand live specifically in Manchester.
p225
aa(lp226
VWe can use these marketing tools to be very specific,
p227
aVso that we know when somebody's viewing, watching
p228
aVand engaging with that content,
p229
aVit's not just the average person, it's not me or you \u2014
p230
aVit's a very specific audience that we are looking to engage with.
p231
aa(lp232
VEven more downstream, we developed a pilot program called "One to One,"
p233
aVwhere we took former extremists
p234
aVand we had them reach out directly to a group of labeled neofascists
p235
aVas well as Islamist extremists,
p236
aVand put direct messages through Facebook Messenger into their inbox, saying,
p237
aV"Hey, I see where you're going. I've been there.
p238
aVIf you want to talk, I'm here."
p239
aVNow, we kind of expected death threats from this sort of interaction.
p240
aVIt's a little alarming to have a former neo-Nazi say, "Hey, how are you?"
p241
aVBut actually, we found that around 60 percent
p242
aVof the people reached out to responded,
p243
aVand of that, around another 60 percent had sustained engagement,
p244
aVmeaning that they were having conversations
p245
aVwith the hardest people to reach about what they were going through,
p246
aVplanting seeds of doubt
p247
aVand giving them alternatives for talking about these subjects,
p248
aVand that's really important.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo what we're trying to do
p251
aVis actually bring unlikely sectors to the table.
p252
aVWe have amazing activists all over the world,
p253
aVbut oftentimes, their messages are not strategic
p254
aVor they don't actually reach the audiences they want to reach.
p255
aVSo we work with networks of former extremists.
p256
aVWe work with networks of young people in different parts of the world.
p257
aVAnd we work with them to bring the tech sector to the table
p258
aVwith artists and creatives and marketing expertise
p259
aVso that we can actually have a more robust and challenging of extremism
p260
aVthat works together.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo I would say that if you are in the audience
p263
aVand you happen to be a graphic designer,
p264
aVa poet, a marketing expert,
p265
aVsomebody that works in PR,
p266
aVa comedian \u2014
p267
aVyou might not think that this is your sector,
p268
aVbut actually, the skills that you have right now
p269
aVmight be exactly what is needed
p270
aVto help challenge extremism effectively.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.
