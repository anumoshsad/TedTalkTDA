VThese are some photos of me volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage
p4
aVin 2006.
p5
aVWhen these photos were taken,
p6
aVI thought I was doing a really good thing
p7
aVand that I was really helping those kids.
p8
aVI had a lot to learn.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt all started for me when I was 19 years old
p11
aVand went backpacking through Southeast Asia.
p12
aVWhen I reached Cambodia,
p13
aVI felt uncomfortable being on holiday surrounded by so much poverty
p14
aVand wanted to do something to give back.
p15
aVSo I visited some orphanages and donated some clothes and books
p16
aVand some money
p17
aVto help the kids that I met.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut one of the orphanages I visited was desperately poor.
p20
aVI had never encountered poverty like that before in my life.
p21
aVThey didn't have funds for enough food,
p22
aVclean water
p23
aVor medical treatment,
p24
aVand the sad little faces on those kids
p25
aVwere heartbreaking.
p26
aVSo I was compelled to do something more to help.
p27
aVI fund-raised in Australia and returned to Cambodia the following year
p28
aVto volunteer at the orphanage for a few months.
p29
aVI taught English and bought water filters and food
p30
aVand took all of the kids to the dentist for the first time in their lives.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut over the course of the next year,
p33
aVI came to discover that this orphanage that I had been supporting
p34
aVwas terribly corrupt.
p35
aVThe director had been embezzling every cent donated to the orphanage,
p36
aVand in my absence, the children were suffering such gross neglect
p37
aVthat they were forced to catch mice to feed themselves.
p38
aVI also found out later
p39
aVthat the director had been physically and sexually abusing the kids.
p40
aVI couldn't bring myself to turn my back on children
p41
aVwho I had come to know and care about
p42
aVand return to my life in Australia.
p43
aVSo I worked with a local team and the local authorities
p44
aVto set up a new orphanage and rescue the kids
p45
aVto give them a safe new home.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut this is where my story takes another unexpected turn.
p48
aVAs I adjusted to my new life running an orphanage in Cambodia,
p49
aV(Khmer) I learned to speak Khmer fluently,
p50
aVwhich means that I learned to speak the Khmer language fluently.
p51
aVAnd when I could communicate properly with the kids,
p52
aVI began to uncover some strange things.
p53
aVMost of the children we had removed from the orphanage
p54
aVwere not, in fact, orphans at all.
p55
aVThey had parents,
p56
aVand the few that were orphaned had other living relatives,
p57
aVlike grandparents and aunties and uncles
p58
aVand other siblings.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo why were these children living in an orphanage
p61
aVwhen they weren't orphans?
p62
aVSince 2005, the number of orphanages in Cambodia
p63
aVhas risen by 75 percent,
p64
aVand the number of children living in Cambodian orphanages
p65
aVhas nearly doubled,
p66
aVdespite the fact
p67
aVthat the vast majority of children living in these orphanages
p68
aVare not orphans in the traditional sense.
p69
aVThey're children from poor families.
p70
aVSo if the vast majority of children living in orphanages
p71
aVare not orphans,
p72
aVthen the term "orphanage"
p73
aVis really just a euphemistic name for a residential care institution.
p74
aVThese institutions go by other names as well,
p75
aVlike "shelters," "safe houses," "children's homes," "children's villages,"
p76
aVeven "boarding schools."
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd this problem is not just confined to Cambodia.
p79
aVThis map shows some of the countries that have seen a dramatic increase
p80
aVin the numbers of residential care institutions
p81
aVand the numbers of children being institutionalized.
p82
aVIn Uganda, for example,
p83
aVthe number of children living in institutions
p84
aVhas increased by more than 1,600 percent since 1992.
p85
aVAnd the problems posed by putting kids into institutions
p86
aVdon't just pertain to the corrupt and abusive institutions
p87
aVlike the one that I rescued the kids from.
p88
aVThe problems are with all forms of residential care.
p89
aa(lp90
VOver 60 years of international research has shown us
p91
aVthat children who grow up in institutions,
p92
aVeven the very best institutions,
p93
aVare at serious risk of developing mental illnesses,
p94
aVattachment disorders,
p95
aVgrowth and speech delays,
p96
aVand many will struggle with an inability to reintegrate
p97
aVback into society later in life
p98
aVand form healthy relationships as adults.
p99
aVThese kids grow up without any model of family
p100
aVor of what good parenting looks like,
p101
aVso they then can struggle to parent their own children.
p102
aVSo if you institutionalize large numbers of children,
p103
aVit will affect not only this generation,
p104
aVbut also the generations to come.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe've learned these lessons before in Australia.
p107
aVIt's what happened to our "Stolen Generations,"
p108
aVthe indigenous children who were removed from their families
p109
aVwith the belief that we could do a better job
p110
aVof raising their children.
p111
aa(lp112
VJust imagine for a moment
p113
aVwhat residential care would be like for a child.
p114
aVFirstly, you have a constant rotation of caregivers,
p115
aVwith somebody new coming on to the shift every eight hours.
p116
aVAnd then on top of that you have a steady stream of visitors
p117
aVand volunteers coming in,
p118
aVshowering you in the love and affection you're craving
p119
aVand then leaving again,
p120
aVevoking all of those feelings of abandonment,
p121
aVand proving again and again
p122
aVthat you are not worthy of being loved.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe don't have orphanages in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,
p125
aVand for a very good reason:
p126
aVone study has shown that young adults raised in institutions
p127
aVare 10 times more likely to fall into sex work than their peers,
p128
aV40 times more likely to have a criminal record,
p129
aVand 500 times more likely
p130
aVto take their own lives.
p131
aVThere are an estimated eight million children around the world
p132
aVliving in institutions like orphanages,
p133
aVdespite the fact that around 80 percent of them are not orphans.
p134
aVMost have families who could be caring for them
p135
aVif they had the right support.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut for me,
p138
aVthe most shocking thing of all to realize
p139
aVis what's contributing to this boom
p140
aVin the unnecessary institutionalization of so many children:
p141
aVit's us \u2014
p142
aVthe tourists, the volunteers
p143
aVand the donors.
p144
aVIt's the well-meaning support from people like me back in 2006,
p145
aVwho visit these children and volunteer and donate,
p146
aVwho are unwittingly fueling an industry that exploits children
p147
aVand tears families apart.
p148
aa(lp149
VIt's really no coincidence that these institutions are largely set up
p150
aVin areas where tourists can most easily be lured in
p151
aVto visit and volunteer in exchange for donations.
p152
aVOf the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,
p153
aVover 90 percent of them are located in the most popular tourist hotspots.
p154
aVThe cold, hard truth is,
p155
aVthe more money that floods in in support of these institutions,
p156
aVthe more institutions open
p157
aVand the more children are removed from their families
p158
aVto fill their beds.
p159
aVIt's just the laws of supply and demand.
p160
aa(lp161
VI had to learn all of these lessons the hard way,
p162
aVafter I had already set up an orphanage in Cambodia.
p163
aVI had to eat a big piece of humble pie to admit
p164
aVthat I had made a mistake
p165
aVand inadvertently become a part of the problem.
p166
aVI had been an orphanage tourist,
p167
aVa voluntourist.
p168
aVI then set up my own orphanage and facilitated orphanage tourism
p169
aVin order to generate funds for my orphanage,
p170
aVbefore I knew better.
p171
aVWhat I came to learn
p172
aVis that no matter how good my orphanage was,
p173
aVit was never going to give those kids what they really needed:
p174
aVtheir families.
p175
aa(lp176
VI know that it can feel incredibly depressing
p177
aVto learn that helping vulnerable children and overcoming poverty
p178
aVis not as simple as we've all been led to believe it should be.
p179
aVBut thankfully, there is a solution.
p180
aVThese problems are reversible and preventable,
p181
aVand when we know better,
p182
aVwe can do better.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe organization that I run today,
p185
aVthe Cambodian Children's Trust,
p186
aVis no longer an orphanage.
p187
aVIn 2012, we changed the model in favor of family-based care.
p188
aVI now lead an amazing team of Cambodian social workers,
p189
aVnurses and teachers.
p190
aVTogether, we work within communities
p191
aVto untangle a complex web of social issues
p192
aVand help Cambodian families escape poverty.
p193
aVOur primary focus is on preventing some of the most vulnerable families
p194
aVin our community
p195
aVfrom being separated in the first place.
p196
aVBut in cases where it's not possible
p197
aVfor a child to live with its biological family,
p198
aVwe support them in foster care.
p199
aVFamily-based care is always better
p200
aVthan placing a child in an institution.
p201
aa(lp202
VDo you remember that first photo that I showed you before?
p203
aVSee that girl who is just about to catch the ball?
p204
aVHer name is Torn
p205
aVShe's a strong, brave and fiercely intelligent girl.
p206
aVBut in 2006, when I first met her
p207
aVliving in that corrupt and abusive orphanage,
p208
aVshe had never been to school.
p209
aVShe was suffering terrible neglect,
p210
aVand she yearned desperately
p211
aVfor the warmth and love of her mother.
p212
aVBut this is a photo of Torn today with her family.
p213
aVHer mother now has a secure job,
p214
aVher siblings are doing well in high school
p215
aVand she is just about to finish her nursing degree at university.
p216
aVFor Torn's family \u2014
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
Vfor Torn's family,
p221
aVthe cycle of poverty has been broken.
p222
aVThe family-based care model that we have developed at CCT
p223
aVhas been so successful,
p224
aVthat it's now being put forward by UNICEF Cambodia
p225
aVand the Cambodian government
p226
aVas a national solution to keep children in families.
p227
aVAnd one of the best \u2014
p228
aa(lp229
V(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd one of the best ways that you can help to solve this problem
p232
aVis by giving these eight million children a voice
p233
aVand become an advocate for family-based care.
p234
aa(lp235
VIf we work together to raise awareness,
p236
aVwe can make sure the world knows
p237
aVthat we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization
p238
aVof vulnerable children.
p239
aVHow do we achieve that?
p240
aVBy redirecting our support and our donations
p241
aVaway from orphanages and residential care institutions
p242
aVtowards organizations that are committed to keeping children in families.
p243
aa(lp244
VI believe we can make this happen in our lifetime,
p245
aVand as a result, we will see developing communities thrive
p246
aVand ensure that vulnerable children everywhere
p247
aVhave what all children need and deserve:
p248
aVa family.
p249
