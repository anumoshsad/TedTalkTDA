VFor emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.
p4
aVSo, first, a small housekeeping announcement:
p5
aVplease switch off your
p6
aVproper English check programs
p7
aVinstalled in your brain.
p8
aV(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
p11
aVIt receives the least rainfall in the country,
p12
aVlowest rainfall.
p13
aVIf you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,
p14
aVcentimeters, 16 [centimeters].
p15
aVThe groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
p16
aVAnd in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.
p17
aVSo, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,
p18
aVthough there is no electricity in most of the villages.
p19
aVBut suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps \u2014
p20
aVthey are of no use in this area.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, welcome to the Golden Desert.
p23
aVClouds seldom visit this area.
p24
aVBut we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
p25
aVThere are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
p26
aVThis is a new work, it's a new program.
p27
aVBut for the desert society
p28
aVthis is no program; this is their life.
p29
aVAnd they harvest rain in many ways.
p30
aVSo, this is the first device they use
p31
aVin harvesting rain.
p32
aVIt's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd you can notice they have created
p35
aVa kind of false catchment.
p36
aVThe desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
p37
aVAnd this is all big raised platform.
p38
aVYou can notice the small holes
p39
aVthe water will fall on this catchment,
p40
aVand there is a slope.
p41
aVSometimes our engineers and architects
p42
aVdo not care about slopes in bathrooms,
p43
aVbut here they will care properly.
p44
aVAnd the water will go where it should go.
p45
aVAnd then it is 40 feet deep.
p46
aVThe waterproofing is done perfectly,
p47
aVbetter than our city contractors,
p48
aVbecause not a single drop should go waste in this.
p49
aa(lp50
VThey collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
p51
aVAnd this is pure drinking water.
p52
aVBelow the surface there is hard saline water.
p53
aVBut now you can have this for year round.
p54
aVIt's two houses.
p55
aVWe often use a term called bylaws.
p56
aVBecause we are used to get written things.
p57
aVBut here it is unwritten by law.
p58
aVAnd people made their house,
p59
aVand the water storage tanks.
p60
aVThese raised up platforms just like this stage.
p61
aVIn fact they go 15 feet deep,
p62
aVand collect rain water from roof,
p63
aVthere is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.
p64
aVIt can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnother big one,
p67
aVthis is of course out of the hardcore desert area.
p68
aVThis is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.
p69
aVAnd it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.
p70
aVThe age is 400 years.
p71
aVSo, since 400 years it has been giving you
p72
aValmost six million gallons of water per season.
p73
aVYou can calculate the price of that water.
p74
aVIt draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
p75
aa(lp76
VYou can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
p77
aVIt can break sometimes.
p78
aVBut this 400 year old canal, which draws water,
p79
aVit is maintained for so many generations.
p80
aVOf course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
p81
aVBut they can be opened for TED people.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVAnd we request them.
p84
aVYou can see person coming up with
p85
aVtwo canisters of water.
p86
aVAnd the water level \u2014 these are not empty canisters \u2014
p87
aVwater level is right up to this.
p88
aVIt can envy many municipalities,
p89
aVthe color, the taste, the purity of this water.
p90
aVAnd this is what they call Zero B type of water,
p91
aVbecause it comes from the clouds,
p92
aVpure distilled water.
p93
aa(lp94
VWe stop for a quick commercial break,
p95
aVand then we come back to the traditional systems.
p96
aVThe government thought that this is a very
p97
aVbackward area and we should bring
p98
aVa multi-million dollar project
p99
aVto bring water from the Himalayas.
p100
aVThat's why I said that this is a commercial break.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVBut we will come back, once again,
p103
aVto the traditional thing.
p104
aVSo, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,
p105
aVsoon it become like this.
p106
aVIn many portions, water hyacinth
p107
aVcovered these big canals like anything.
p108
aa(lp109
VOf course there are some areas where water is reaching,
p110
aVI'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
p111
aVBut the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,
p112
aVyou will notice in Bikaner things like this:
p113
aVwhere the water hyacinth couldn't grow,
p114
aVthe sand is flowing in these canals.
p115
aVThe bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
p116
aV(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VWe had full-page advertisements,
p119
aVsome 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.
p120
aVThey said that throw away your traditional systems,
p121
aVthese new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
p122
aVIt's a dream. And it became a dream also.
p123
aVBecause soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
p124
aVAnd people started renovating their own structures.
p125
aa(lp126
VThese are all traditional water structures,
p127
aVwhich we won't be able to explain in such a short time.
p128
aVBut you can see that no woman is standing on those.
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aVAnd they are plaiting hair.
p131
aV(Applause)
p132
aVJaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
p133
aVThis town was established 800 years ago.
p134
aVI'm not sure by that time
p135
aVBombay was there, or Delhi was there,
p136
aVor Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, this was the terminal point for silk route.
p139
aVWell connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
p140
aVNone of us were able to go to Europe,
p141
aVbut Jaisalmer was well connected to it.
p142
aVAnd this is the 16 centimeter area.
p143
aVSuch a limited rainfall,
p144
aVand highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
p145
aVYou won't find water in this slide.
p146
aVBut it is invisible.
p147
aVSomewhere a stream or a rivulet
p148
aVis running through here.
p149
aVOr, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout
p150
aVbecause every roof which you see in this picture
p151
aVcollects rainwater drops
p152
aVand deposit in the rooms.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut apart from this system,
p155
aVthey designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.
p156
aVAnd what we call private public partnership
p157
aVyou can add estate also.
p158
aVSo, estate, public and private entrepreneurs
p159
aVwork together to build this beautiful water body.
p160
aVAnd it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
p161
aVYou will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.
p162
aVWhether water level goes up or down,
p163
aVthe beauty is there throughout.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnother water body, dried up, of course,
p166
aVduring the summer period,
p167
aVbut you can see how the traditional society
p168
aVcombines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
p169
aVThese statues, marvelous statues,
p170
aVgives you an idea of water table.
p171
aVWhen this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,
p172
aVit will submerge these beautiful statues
p173
aVin what we call in English today "mass communication."
p174
aVThis was for mass communication.
p175
aVEverybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,
p176
aVso water will be there for seven months or nine months,
p177
aVor 12 months.
p178
aVAnd then they will come and worship this pond,
p179
aVpay respect, their gratitude.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnother small water body, called the [unclear].
p182
aVIt is difficult to translate in English,
p183
aVespecially in my English.
p184
aVBut the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
p185
aVThe reputation in desert of this small water body is
p186
aVthat it never dries up.
p187
aVIn severe drought periods
p188
aVnobody has seen this water body
p189
aVgetting dried up.
p190
aVAnd perhaps they knew the future also.
p191
aVIt was designed some 150 years ago.
p192
aVBut perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,
p193
aVthere will be a TED green and blue session,
p194
aVso they painted it like this.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aV(Applause)
p197
aa(lp198
VDry water body. Children are standing on
p199
aVa very difficult device to explain.
p200
aVThis is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
p201
aVBut this is not ground water.
p202
aVYou can draw ground water from any well.
p203
aVBut this is no ordinary well.
p204
aVIt squeeze the moisture
p205
aVhidden in the sand.
p206
aVAnd they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].
p207
aVAnd there is a gypsum belt running below it.
p208
aVAnd it was deposited by the great mother Earth,
p209
aVsome three million years ago.
p210
aVAnd where we have this gypsum strip
p211
aVthey can harvest this water.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis is the same dry water body.
p214
aVNow, you don't find any kund;
p215
aVthey are all submerged.
p216
aVBut when the water goes down they will be able
p217
aVto draw water from those structures throughout the year.
p218
aVThis year they have received only six centimeters.
p219
aVSix centimeter of rainfall,
p220
aVand they can telephone you
p221
aVthat if you find any water problem in your city,
p222
aVDelhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,
p223
aVplease come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VHow they maintain them?
p227
aVThere are three things: concept, planning,
p228
aVmaking the actual thing, and also maintaining them.
p229
aVIt is a structure for maintain,
p230
aVfor centuries, by generations, without any department,
p231
aVwithout any funding,
p232
aVSo the secret is "[unclear]," respect.
p233
aVYour own thing, not personal property,
p234
aVmy property, every time.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo, these stone pillars
p237
aVwill remind you that you are entering into a water body area.
p238
aVDon't spit, don't do anything wrong,
p239
aVso that the clean water can be collected.
p240
aVAnother pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
p241
aVIf you climb these three, six steps
p242
aVyou will find something very nice.
p243
aVThis was done in 11th century.
p244
aVAnd you have to go further down.
p245
aVThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words,
p246
aVso we can say a thousand words right now,
p247
aVan another thousand words.
p248
aVIf the water table goes down,
p249
aVyou will find new stairs.
p250
aVIf it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
p251
aVSo, throughout the year
p252
aVthis beautiful system will give you some pleasure.
p253
aVThree sides, such steps, on the fourth side
p254
aVthere is a four-story building
p255
aVwhere you can organize such TED conferences anytime.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VExcuse me, who built these structures?
p259
aVThey are in front of you.
p260
aVThe best civil engineers we had, the best planners,
p261
aVthe best architects.
p262
aVWe can say that because of them,
p263
aVbecause of their forefathers,
p264
aVIndia could get the first engineering college
p265
aVin 1847.
p266
aVThere were no English medium schools at that time,
p267
aVeven no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
p268
aVBut such people, compelled to the East India Company,
p269
aVwhich came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVbut not to create the engineering colleges.
p272
aVBut because of them, first engineering college was created
p273
aVin a small village, not in the town.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe last point, we all know in our primary schools that
p276
aVthat camel is a ship of desert.
p277
aVSo, you can find through your Jeep,
p278
aVa camel, and a cart.
p279
aVThis tire comes from the airplane.
p280
aVSo, look at the beauty from the desert society
p281
aVwho can harvest rainwater,
p282
aVand also create something
p283
aVthrough a tire from a jet plane,
p284
aVand used in a camel cart.
p285
aa(lp286
VLast picture, it's a tattoo,
p287
aV2,000-years-old tattoo.
p288
aVThey were using it on their body.
p289
aVTattoo was, at one time,
p290
aVa kind of a blacklisted
p291
aVor con thing, but now it is in thing.
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aV(Applause)
p294
aVYou can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.
p295
aV(Laughter)
p296
aVThe center of life is water.
p297
aVThese are the beautiful waves.
p298
aVThese are the beautiful stairs
p299
aVwhich we just saw in one of the slides.
p300
aVThese are the trees.
p301
aVAnd these are the flowers which
p302
aVadd fragrance to our lives.
p303
aVSo, this is the message of desert.
p304
aVThank you very much.
p305
aV(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VChris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.
p308
aV(Applause)
p309
aVThese artifacts and designs are inspiring.
p310
aVDo you believe that they can be used elsewhere,
p311
aVthat the world can learn from this?
p312
aVOr is this just right for this place?
p313
aa(lp314
VAnupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to
p315
aVutilize water that falls on our area.
p316
aVSo, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,
p317
aVright from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.
p318
aVAnd these [unclear], which stored water,
p319
aVthere are two type of things.
p320
aVOne recharge, and one stores.
p321
aVSo, it depends on the terrain.
p322
aVBut kund, which uses the gypsum belt,
p323
aVfor that you have to go back to your calendar,
p324
aVthree million years ago.
p325
aVIf it is there it can be done right now.
p326
aVOtherwise, it can't be done.
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
