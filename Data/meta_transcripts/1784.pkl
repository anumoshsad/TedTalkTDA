VWhen we talk about corruption,
p4
aVthere are typical types of individuals that spring to mind.
p5
aVThere's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.
p6
aVSaparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.
p7
aVUntil his death in 2006,
p8
aVhe was the all-powerful leader of Turkmenistan,
p9
aVa Central Asian country rich in natural gas.
p10
aVNow, he really loved to issue presidential decrees.
p11
aVAnd one renamed the months of the year
p12
aVincluding after himself and his mother.
p13
aVHe spent millions of dollars
p14
aVcreating a bizarre personality cult,
p15
aVand his crowning glory was the building
p16
aVof a 40-foot-high gold-plated statue of himself
p17
aVwhich stood proudly in the capital's central square
p18
aVand rotated to follow the sun.
p19
aVHe was a slightly unusual guy.
p20
aVAnd then there's that cliché,
p21
aVthe African dictator or minister or official.
p22
aVThere's Teodorín Obiang.
p23
aVSo his daddy is president for life of Equatorial Guinea,
p24
aVa West African nation that has exported
p25
aVbillions of dollars of oil since the 1990s
p26
aVand yet has a truly appalling human rights record.
p27
aVThe vast majority of its people
p28
aVare living in really miserable poverty
p29
aVdespite an income per capita that's on a par
p30
aVwith that of Portugal.
p31
aVSo Obiang junior, well, he buys himself
p32
aVa $30 million mansion in Malibu, California.
p33
aVI've been up to its front gates.
p34
aVI can tell you it's a magnificent spread.
p35
aVHe bought an \u20ac18 million art collection
p36
aVthat used to belong to fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent,
p37
aVa stack of fabulous sports cars,
p38
aVsome costing a million dollars apiece \u2014
p39
aVoh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.
p40
aVNow get this:
p41
aVUntil recently, he was earning an official monthly salary
p42
aVof less than 7,000 dollars.
p43
aVAnd there's Dan Etete.
p44
aVWell, he was the former oil minister of Nigeria
p45
aVunder President Abacha,
p46
aVand it just so happens he's a convicted money launderer too.
p47
aVWe've spent a great deal of time
p48
aVinvestigating a $1 billion \u2014
p49
aVthat's right, a $1 billion \u2014
p50
aVoil deal that he was involved with,
p51
aVand what we found was pretty shocking,
p52
aVbut more about that later.
p53
aVSo it's easy to think that corruption happens
p54
aVsomewhere over there,
p55
aVcarried out by a bunch of greedy despots
p56
aVand individuals up to no good in countries
p57
aVthat we, personally, may know very little about
p58
aVand feel really unconnected to
p59
aVand unaffected by what might be going on.
p60
aVBut does it just happen over there?
p61
aVWell, at 22, I was very lucky.
p62
aVMy first job out of university
p63
aVwas investigating the illegal trade in African ivory.
p64
aVAnd that's how my relationship with corruption really began.
p65
aVIn 1993, with two friends who were colleagues,
p66
aVSimon Taylor and Patrick Alley,
p67
aVwe set up an organization called Global Witness.
p68
aVOur first campaign was investigating the role
p69
aVof illegal logging in funding the war in Cambodia.
p70
aVSo a few years later, and it's now 1997,
p71
aVand I'm in Angola undercover investigating blood diamonds.
p72
aVPerhaps you saw the film,
p73
aVthe Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"
p74
aVthe one with Leonardo DiCaprio.
p75
aVWell, some of that sprang from our work.
p76
aVLuanda, it was full of land mine victims
p77
aVwho were struggling to survive on the streets
p78
aVand war orphans living in sewers under the streets,
p79
aVand a tiny, very wealthy elite
p80
aVwho gossiped about shopping trips to Brazil and Portugal.
p81
aVAnd it was a slightly crazy place.
p82
aVSo I'm sitting in a hot and very stuffy hotel room
p83
aVfeeling just totally overwhelmed.
p84
aVBut it wasn't about blood diamonds.
p85
aVBecause I'd been speaking to lots of people there
p86
aVwho, well, they talked about a different problem:
p87
aVthat of a massive web of corruption on a global scale
p88
aVand millions of oil dollars going missing.
p89
aVAnd for what was then a very small organization
p90
aVof just a few people,
p91
aVtrying to even begin to think how we might tackle that
p92
aVwas an enormous challenge.
p93
aVAnd in the years that I've been,
p94
aVand we've all been campaigning and investigating,
p95
aVI've repeatedly seen that what makes corruption
p96
aVon a global, massive scale possible,
p97
aVwell it isn't just greed or the misuse of power
p98
aVor that nebulous phrase "weak governance."
p99
aVI mean, yes, it's all of those,
p100
aVbut corruption, it's made possible by the actions
p101
aVof global facilitators.
p102
aVSo let's go back to some of those people I talked about earlier.
p103
aVNow, they're all people we've investigated,
p104
aVand they're all people who couldn't do what they do alone.
p105
aVTake Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up
p106
aVwith high-end art and luxury houses without help.
p107
aVHe did business with global banks.
p108
aVA bank in Paris held accounts of companies controlled by him,
p109
aVone of which was used to buy the art,
p110
aVand American banks, well, they funneled
p111
aV73 million dollars into the States,
p112
aVsome of which was used to buy that California mansion.
p113
aVAnd he didn't do all of this in his own name either.
p114
aVHe used shell companies.
p115
aVHe used one to buy the property, and another,
p116
aVwhich was in somebody else's name,
p117
aVto pay the huge bills it cost to run the place.
p118
aVAnd then there's Dan Etete.
p119
aVWell, when he was oil minister,
p120
aVhe awarded an oil block now worth over a billion dollars
p121
aVto a company that, guess what, yeah,
p122
aVhe was the hidden owner of.
p123
aVNow, it was then much later traded on
p124
aVwith the kind assistance of the Nigerian government \u2014
p125
aVnow I have to be careful what I say here \u2014
p126
aVto subsidiaries of Shell and the Italian Eni,
p127
aVtwo of the biggest oil companies around.
p128
aVSo the reality is, is that the engine of corruption,
p129
aVwell, it exists far beyond the shores of countries
p130
aVlike Equatorial Guinea or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
p131
aVThis engine, well, it's driven
p132
aVby our international banking system,
p133
aVby the problem of anonymous shell companies,
p134
aVand by the secrecy that we have afforded
p135
aVbig oil, gas and mining operations,
p136
aVand, most of all, by the failure of our politicians
p137
aVto back up their rhetoric and do something
p138
aVreally meaningful and systemic to tackle this stuff.
p139
aVNow let's take the banks first.
p140
aVWell, it's not going to come as any surprise
p141
aVfor me to tell you that banks accept dirty money,
p142
aVbut they prioritize their profits in other destructive ways too.
p143
aVFor example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
p144
aVNow this region, it has just five percent
p145
aVof its forests left intact. Five percent.
p146
aVSo how did that happen?
p147
aVWell, because an elite and its facilitators
p148
aVhave been making millions of dollars
p149
aVfrom supporting logging on an industrial scale
p150
aVfor many years.
p151
aVSo we sent an undercover investigator in
p152
aVto secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite,
p153
aVand the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry,
p154
aVand you can see that on YouTube,
p155
aVbut it proved what we had long suspected,
p156
aVbecause it showed how the state's chief minister,
p157
aVdespite his later denials,
p158
aVused his control over land and forest licenses
p159
aVto enrich himself and his family.
p160
aVAnd HSBC, well, we know that HSBC bankrolled
p161
aVthe region's largest logging companies
p162
aVthat were responsible for some of that destruction
p163
aVin Sarawak and elsewhere.
p164
aVThe bank violated its own sustainability policies in the process,
p165
aVbut it earned around 130 million dollars.
p166
aVNow shortly after our exposé,
p167
aVvery shortly after our exposé earlier this year,
p168
aVthe bank announced a policy review on this.
p169
aVAnd is this progress? Maybe,
p170
aVbut we're going to be keeping a very close eye
p171
aVon that case.
p172
aVAnd then there's the problem of anonymous shell companies.
p173
aVWell, we've all heard about what they are, I think,
p174
aVand we all know they're used quite a bit
p175
aVby people and companies who are trying to avoid
p176
aVpaying their proper dues to society,
p177
aValso known as taxes.
p178
aVBut what doesn't usually come to light
p179
aVis how shell companies are used to steal
p180
aVhuge sums of money, transformational sums of money,
p181
aVfrom poor countries.
p182
aVIn virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated,
p183
aVshell companies have appeared,
p184
aVand sometimes it's been impossible to find out
p185
aVwho is really involved in the deal.
p186
aVA recent study by the World Bank
p187
aVlooked at 200 cases of corruption.
p188
aVIt found that over 70 percent of those cases
p189
aVhad used anonymous shell companies,
p190
aVtotaling almost 56 billion dollars.
p191
aVNow many of these companies were in America
p192
aVor the United Kingdom,
p193
aVits overseas territories and Crown dependencies,
p194
aVand so it's not just an offshore problem,
p195
aVit's an on-shore one too.
p196
aVYou see, shell companies, they're central
p197
aVto the secret deals which may benefit wealthy elites
p198
aVrather than ordinary citizens.
p199
aVOne striking recent case that we've investigated
p200
aVis how the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo
p201
aVsold off a series of valuable, state-owned mining assets
p202
aVto shell companies in the British Virgin Islands.
p203
aVSo we spoke to sources in country,
p204
aVtrawled through company documents and other information
p205
aVtrying to piece together a really true picture of the deal.
p206
aVAnd we were alarmed to find that these shell companies
p207
aVhad quickly flipped many of the assets on
p208
aVfor huge profits to major international mining companies
p209
aVlisted in London.
p210
aVNow, the Africa Progress Panel, led by Kofi Annan,
p211
aVthey've calculated that Congo may have lost
p212
aVmore than 1.3 billion dollars from these deals.
p213
aVThat's almost twice
p214
aVthe country's annual health and education budget combined.
p215
aVAnd will the people of Congo, will they ever get their money back?
p216
aVWell, the answer to that question,
p217
aVand who was really involved and what really happened,
p218
aVwell that's going to probably remain locked away
p219
aVin the secretive company registries of the British Virgin Islands
p220
aVand elsewhere unless we all do something about it.
p221
aVAnd how about the oil, gas and mining companies?
p222
aVOkay, maybe it's a bit of a cliché to talk about them.
p223
aVCorruption in that sector, no surprise.
p224
aVThere's corruption everywhere, so why focus on that sector?
p225
aVWell, because there's a lot at stake.
p226
aVIn 2011, natural resource exports
p227
aVoutweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one
p228
aVin Africa, Asia and Latin America. Nineteen to one.
p229
aVNow that's a hell of a lot of schools and universities
p230
aVand hospitals and business startups,
p231
aVmany of which haven't materialized and never will
p232
aVbecause some of that money has simply been stolen away.
p233
aVNow let's go back to the oil and mining companies,
p234
aVand let's go back to Dan Etete and that $1 billion deal.
p235
aVAnd now forgive me, I'm going to read the next bit
p236
aVbecause it's a very live issue, and our lawyers
p237
aVhave been through this in some detail
p238
aVand they want me to get it right.
p239
aVNow, on the surface, the deal appeared straightforward.
p240
aVSubsidiaries of Shell and Eni
p241
aVpaid the Nigerian government for the block.
p242
aVThe Nigerian government transferred
p243
aVprecisely the same amount, to the very dollar,
p244
aVto an account earmarked for a shell company
p245
aVwhose hidden owner was Etete.
p246
aVNow, that's not bad going for a convicted money launderer.
p247
aVAnd here's the thing.
p248
aVAfter many months of digging around
p249
aVand reading through hundreds of pages of court documents,
p250
aVwe found evidence that, in fact,
p251
aVShell and Eni had known that the funds
p252
aVwould be transferred to that shell company,
p253
aVand frankly, it's hard to believe they didn't know
p254
aVwho they were really dealing with there.
p255
aVNow, it just shouldn't take these sorts of efforts
p256
aVto find out where the money in deals like this went.
p257
aVI mean, these are state assets.
p258
aVThey're supposed to be used for the benefit
p259
aVof the people in the country.
p260
aVBut in some countries, citizens and journalists
p261
aVwho are trying to expose stories like this
p262
aVhave been harassed and arrested
p263
aVand some have even risked their lives to do so.
p264
aVAnd finally, well, there are those who believe
p265
aVthat corruption is unavoidable.
p266
aVIt's just how some business is done.
p267
aVIt's too complex and difficult to change.
p268
aVSo in effect, what? We just accept it.
p269
aVBut as a campaigner and investigator,
p270
aVI have a different view,
p271
aVbecause I've seen what can happen
p272
aVwhen an idea gains momentum.
p273
aVIn the oil and mining sector, for example,
p274
aVthere is now the beginning
p275
aVof a truly worldwide transparency standard
p276
aVthat could tackle some of these problems.
p277
aVIn 1999, when Global Witness called
p278
aVfor oil companies to make payments on deals transparent,
p279
aVwell, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté
p280
aVof that small idea.
p281
aVBut literally hundreds of civil society groups
p282
aVfrom around the world came together
p283
aVto fight for transparency,
p284
aVand now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
p285
aVTwo thirds of the value
p286
aVof the world's oil and mining companies
p287
aVare now covered by transparency laws. Two thirds.
p288
aVSo this is change happening.
p289
aVThis is progress.
p290
aVBut we're not there yet, by far.
p291
aVBecause it really isn't about corruption
p292
aVsomewhere over there, is it?
p293
aVIn a globalized world, corruption
p294
aVis a truly globalized business,
p295
aVand one that needs global solutions,
p296
aVsupported and pushed by us all, as global citizens,
p297
aVright here.
p298
aVThank you.
