V(Music: "The Sound of Silence," Simon & Garfunkel)
p4
aa(lp5
VHello voice mail, my old friend.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI've called for tech support again.
p10
aVI ignored my boss's warning.
p11
aVI called on a Monday morning.
p12
aVNow it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.
p13
aVI'm still on hold.
p14
aVI'm listening to the sounds of silence.
p15
aVI don't think you understand.
p16
aVI think your phone lines are unmanned.
p17
aVI punched every touch tone I was told,
p18
aVbut I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
p19
aVIt's not enough your software crashed my Mac,
p20
aVand it constantly hangs and bombs \u2014
p21
aVit erased my ROMs!
p22
aVNow the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
p23
aVIn my dreams I fantasize
p24
aVof wreaking vengeance on you guys.
p25
aVSay your motorcycle crashes.
p26
aVBlood comes gushing from your gashes.
p27
aVWith your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD.
p28
aVBut you get me.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd you listen to the sounds of silence.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Music)
p35
aa(lp36
V(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VThank you.
p39
aa(lp40
VGood evening and welcome to:
p41
aV"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist."
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VWhen I was offered the Times column six years ago,
p46
aVthe deal was like this:
p47
aVyou'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets.
p48
aVEvery week, it'll arrive at your door.
p49
aVYou get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them
p50
aVuntil the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back,
p51
aVand you'll get paid for it.
p52
aVYou can think about it, if you want.
p53
aVSo, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.
p54
aVThe job, though, came with one small downside, and that is,
p55
aVthey intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
p56
aVAnd what I've noticed is \u2014 first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.
p57
aa(lp58
VIf you ever are feeling lonely,
p59
aVget a New York Times column,
p60
aVbecause you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.
p61
aVAnd the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
p62
aVPeople are feeling like things \u2014
p63
aVOk, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.
p64
aVLucky you can't see it.
p65
aVPeople are feeling overwhelmed.
p66
aVThey're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.
p67
aVIt may be good technology,
p68
aVbut I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.
p69
aVThere's not enough help.
p70
aVThere's not enough thought put into the design of it
p71
aVto make it easy and enjoyable to use.
p72
aVOne time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support,
p73
aVand within 12 hours, there were 700 messages
p74
aVfrom readers on the feedback boards on the Times website,
p75
aVfrom users saying,
p76
aV""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."
p77
aVI call it "software rage."
p78
aVAnd man, let me tell you,
p79
aVwhoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will \u2014
p80
aVOh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VOk, so why is the problem accelerating?
p85
aVAnd part of the problem is, ironically,
p86
aVbecause the industry has put so much thought
p87
aVinto making things easier to use.
p88
aVI'll show you what I mean.
p89
aVThis is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
p90
aVOver the years, it's gotten easier to use.
p91
aVThis is the original Mac operating system.
p92
aVReagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.
p93
aVAnd the entire operating system \u2014
p94
aVthis is the good part \u2014 the entire operating system fit in 211 k.
p95
aVYou couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo the irony is, that as these things became easier to use,
p100
aVa less technical, broader audience was coming into contact
p101
aVwith this equipment for the first time.
p102
aa(lp103
VI once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center
p104
aVfor a day.
p105
aVThe guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.
p106
aVAnd the calls that \u2014 you know how they say,
p107
aV"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"
p108
aVUh-uh.
p109
aVYour call may be recorded
p110
aVso that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories
p111
aVand pass them around on a CD.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VWhich they do.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd I have a copy.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VIt's in your gift bag. No, no.
p124
aVWith your voices on it!
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.
p127
aVA woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking.
p128
aVMaking a squeaking noise.
p129
aVAnd the technician said,
p130
aa(lp131
V"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?"
p132
aa(lp133
VShe says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder,
p134
aVthe faster I move it across the screen."
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd the technician's like,
p139
aV"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
p140
aa(lp141
VShe goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VWell, if you like that one \u2014 how much time have we got?
p146
aVAnother one, a guy called \u2014 this is absolutely true \u2014
p147
aVhis computer had crashed, and he told the technician
p148
aVhe couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."
p149
aVAnd the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?"
p150
aVHe said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'"
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VSo, we must admit
p155
aVthat some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.
p156
aVBut why is the technical overload crisis,
p157
aVthe complexity crisis, accelerating now?
p158
aa(lp159
VIn the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want
p160
aVeverything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
p161
aVSo the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier,
p162
aVbut our fingers are essentially staying the same size.
p163
aVSo it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
p164
aVSoftware is subject to another primal force:
p165
aVthe mandate to release more and more versions.
p166
aVWhen you buy a piece of software,
p167
aVit's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.
p168
aVIt's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year,
p169
aVand every year, they say,
p170
aV"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."
p171
aVI know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
p172
aVAnd software companies make 35 percent of their revenue
p173
aVfrom just these software upgrades.
p174
aVI call it the Software Upgrade Paradox \u2014
p175
aVwhich is that if you improve a piece of software enough times,
p176
aVyou eventually ruin it.
p177
aa(lp178
VI mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know,
p179
aVthe Eisenhower administration.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VBut what's the alternative?
p184
aVMicrosoft actually did this experiment.
p185
aVThey said, "Well, wait a minute.
p186
aVEveryone complains that we're adding so many features.
p187
aVLet's create a word processor that's just a word processor:
p188
aVSimple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."
p189
aVAnd it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write.
p190
aVAnd none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.
p191
aVIt tanked. No one ever bought it.
p192
aVI call this the Sport Utility Principle.
p193
aVPeople like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?
p194
aVThey don't need the database and the website, but they're like,
p195
aV"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
p196
aVSo the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?
p197
aVWhere are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.
p198
aVYou can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
p199
aVBut if you're not careful about how you choose,
p200
aVyou wind up with this.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VThis is an un-retouched \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014
p205
aVun-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,
p206
aVthe copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.
p207
aVYou've obviously never opened all the toolbars,
p208
aVbut all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd we've arrived at the age of interface matrices,
p213
aVwhere there are so many features and options,
p214
aVyou have to do two dimensions, you know:
p215
aVa vertical and a horizontal.
p216
aVYou guys all complain
p217
aVabout how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists
p218
aVand underlining your links automatically.
p219
aVThe off switch is in there somewhere.
p220
aVI'm telling you \u2014 it's there.
p221
aVPart of the art of designing a simple, good interface,
p222
aVis knowing when to use which one of these features.
p223
aVSo, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.
p224
aVThere are only four choices,
p225
aVso why are they in a pop-up menu?
p226
aVIt's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components
p227
aVthat you need to collapse the choices.
p228
aVThey could have put them all out in view.
p229
aa(lp230
VHere's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VThank you \u2014 yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no.
p235
aVAlready, we can see that Apple and Microsoft
p236
aVhave a severely divergent approach to software design.
p237
aVMicrosoft's approach to simplicity tends to be:
p238
aVlet's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
p239
aVThere are these "wizards" everywhere.
p240
aVAnd you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
p241
aVIf they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling
p242
aVwhere they might wind up.
p243
aa(lp244
V[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
V"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."
p251
aVOk, I'll bite.
p252
aVLet's click "Next" to continue.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
V(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VFrom the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VSo there is a limit that we don't want to cross.
p263
aVSo what is the answer?
p264
aVHow do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?
p265
aVI believe in consistency, when possible,
p266
aVreal-world equivalents,
p267
aVtrash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.
p268
aVBut I beg of the designers here
p269
aVto break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all,
p270
aVwhich is intelligence.
p271
aVNow what do I mean by that?
p272
aVI'm going to give you some examples
p273
aVwhere intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
p274
aa(lp275
VIf you are buying something on the web,
p276
aVyou're supposed to put in your address,
p277
aVand you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?
p278
aVThere are 200 countries in the world.
p279
aVWe like to think of the Internet as a global village.
p280
aVI'm sorry; it's not one yet.
p281
aVIt's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.
p282
aVSo why is "United States" in the "U"s?
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VYou have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it.
p287
aVNow, it would be inconsistent to put "United States" first,
p288
aVbut it would be intelligent.
p289
aa(lp290
VThis one's been touched on before,
p291
aVbut why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC
p292
aVby clicking a button called "Start?"
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VHere's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.
p297
aVMost of the time, you want to print one copy of your document,
p298
aVin page order, on that printer.
p299
aVSo why in God's name do you see this every time you print?
p300
aVIt's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VNow, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced
p311
aVthe cult of simplicity.
p312
aVPalm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.
p313
aVI actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s,
p314
aVand after the talk, I met one of the employees.
p315
aVHe says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you. What do you do here?"
p316
aVHe said, "I'm a tap counter." I'm like, "You're a what?"
p317
aVHe goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says,
p318
aV'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus,
p319
aVit's too long, and it has to be redesigned.'
p320
aVSo I'm the tap counter."
p321
aVSo, I'm going to show you an example
p322
aVof a company that does not have a tap counter.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VThis is Microsoft Word.
p327
aVOk, when you want to create a new blank document in Word \u2014
p328
aVit could happen.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VYou go up to the "File" menu and you choose "New."
p333
aVNow, what happens when you choose "New?"
p334
aVDo you get a new blank document?
p335
aVYou do not.
p336
aVOn the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears,
p337
aVand somewhere in those links \u2014 by the way, not at the top \u2014
p338
aVsomewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.
p339
aVOk, so that is a company not counting taps.
p340
aVYou know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...
p341
aVYes, I do.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VThe Bill Gates song!
p348
aa(lp349
V(Piano music)
p350
aa(lp351
VI've been a geek forever
p352
aVand I wrote the very first DOS.
p353
aVI put my software and IBM together;
p354
aVI got profit and they got the loss.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VI write the code that makes the whole world run.
p359
aVI'm getting royalties from everyone.
p360
aVSometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.
p361
aVYou buy the box; I'll sell the code.
p362
aVEvery software company is doing Microsoft's R&D.
p363
aVYou can't keep a good idea down these days.
p364
aVEven Windows is a hack.
p365
aVWe're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
p366
aVSo it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go.
p367
aVI'm not doing this for praise.
p368
aVI write the code that fits the world today.
p369
aVBig mediocrity in every way.
p370
aVWe've entered planet domination mode.
p371
aVYou'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
p372
aVI am Bill Gates and I write the code.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VBut actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.
p377
aVThere's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.
p378
aVThey're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.
p379
aVThey're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff
p380
aVlocks into the old 1982 chassis.
p381
aVBut there's also a new Microsoft,
p382
aVthat's really doing good, simple interface designs.
p383
aVI liked the Media Center PC.
p384
aVI liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
p385
aVThe Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market,
p386
aVbut it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.
p387
aVBut let's put it this way:
p388
aVwould you pay $10 a month to have a watch
p389
aVthat has to be recharged every night like your cell phone,
p390
aVand stops working when you leave your area code?
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VSo, the signs might indicate
p395
aVthat the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.
p396
aVSo is there any hope?
p397
aVThe screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating,
p398
aVputting manuals in the boxes,
p399
aVthings are coming out at a faster pace.
p400
aVIt's funny \u2014 when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997,
p401
aVafter 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo \u2014
p402
aVhe came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans,
p403
aVand he sort of did this.
p404
aVThe crowd went wild, but I had just seen \u2014
p405
aVI'm like, where have I seen this before?
p406
aVI had just seen the movie "Evita" \u2014
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
Vwith Madonna,
p411
aVand I'm like, you know what?
p412
aVI've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Music)
p415
aa(lp416
VIt won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
VWhen I try to explain why I'm back,
p421
aVafter telling the press Apple's future is black.
p422
aVYou won't believe me.
p423
aVAll that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage
p424
aVwith only a buddy named Woz.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
VYou try rhyming with garage!
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VDon't cry for me, Cupertino.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VThe truth is, I never left you.
p437
aVI know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.
p438
aVI made a fortune over at Pixar.
p439
aa(lp440
V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VDon't cry for me, Cupertino.
p443
aVI've still got the drive and vision.
p444
aVI still wear sandals in any weather.
p445
aVIt's just that these days,
p446
aVthey're Gucci leather.
p447
aa(lp448
V(Laughter)
p449
aa(lp450
V(Applause)
p451
aa(lp452
VThank you.
p453
aa(lp454
VSo Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty.
p455
aVAnd the truth is,
p456
aVfor years I was a little depressed,
p457
aVbecause Americans obviously did not value it,
p458
aVbecause the Mac had three percent market share,
p459
aVWindows had 95 percent market share \u2014
p460
aVpeople did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
p461
aVSo I was a little depressed.
p462
aVAnd then I heard Al Gore's talk,
p463
aVand I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.
p464
aa(lp465
V(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VBut it turns out I was wrong, right?
p468
aVBecause the iPod came out,
p469
aVand it violated every bit of common wisdom.
p470
aVOther products cost less; other products had more features,
p471
aVthey had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
p472
aVThe other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard,
p473
aVnot Apple's propriety standard.
p474
aVBut the iPod won \u2014 this is the one they wanted.
p475
aVThe lesson was: simplicity sells.
p476
aVAnd there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
p477
aVThis is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.
p478
aVThe Sonos thing \u2014 it's catching on.
p479

VI've got just a couple examples.
p481
aVPhysically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately.
p482
aVWhen you have a digital camera,
p483
aVhow do you get the pictures back to your computer?
p484
aVWell, you either haul around a USB cable,
p485
aVor you buy a card reader and haul that around.
p486
aVEither one, you're going to lose.
p487
aVWhat I do is, I take out the memory card,
p488
aVand I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
p489
aVI just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures,
p490
aVput it right back in the camera.
p491
aVI never have to lose anything.
p492
aVHere's another example.
p493
aVChris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?
p494
aa(lp495
VChris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go.
p496
aVYou might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop.
p497
aVThis the power cord. It hooks on like this.
p498
aVAnd I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives,
p499
aVor one of your children.
p500
aVYou walk along \u2014 and I'm about to pull this onto the floor.
p501
aVI don't care. It's a loaner.
p502
aVHere we go. Whoa!
p503
aVIt's magnetic \u2014 it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
p504
aa(lp505
V(Applause)
p506
aa(lp507
VIn my very last example \u2014
p508
aVI do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.
p509
aVAnd I'll just \u2014 you have to be kind of quiet
p510
aVbecause the software is nervous.
p511
aVSpeech recognition software is really great
p512
aVfor doing emails very quickly; period.
p513
aVLike, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
p514
aVAnd it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.
p515
aVI also use this feature called voice macros; period.
p516
aVCorrect "dissuade."
p517
aVNot "just."
p518
aVOk, this is not an ideal situation,
p519
aVbecause it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
p520
aVThe point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word,
p521
aVand having it write out a much longer thing.
p522
aVSo if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say,
p523
aV"Thanks for that."
p524
aa(lp525
V[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...]
p526
aa(lp527
V(Laughter)
p528
aa(lp529
V(Applause)
p530
aa(lp531
VAnd conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail \u2014
p532
aVwhich happens daily \u2014
p533
aVI say, "Piss off."
p534
aa(lp535
V(Laughter)
p536
aa(lp537
V[I admire your frankness ...]
p538
aa(lp539
V(Laughter)
p540
aa(lp541
V(Applause)
p542
aa(lp543
VSo that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.
p544
aa(lp545
V(Laughter)
p546
aa(lp547
VSo the point is \u2014 this is a really interesting story.
p548
aVThis is version eight of this software,
p549
aVand do you know what they put in version eight?
p550
aVNo new features. It's never happened before in software!
p551
aVThe company put no new features.
p552
aVThey just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right?
p553
aVBecause for years, people had bought this software, tried it out \u2014
p554
aV95 percent accuracy was all they got,
p555
aVwhich means one in 20 words is wrong \u2014
p556
aVand they'd put it in their drawer.
p557
aVAnd the company got sick of that,
p558
aVso they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything,
p559
aVbut make sure it's darned accurate."
p560
aVAnd so that's what they did.
p561
aa(lp562
VThis cult of doing things right is starting to spread.
p563
aVSo, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology:
p564
aVremember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?
p565
aVIt could be the design of the thing you're using.
p566
aVBe aware in life of good design and bad design.
p567
aVAnd if you're among the people who create this stuff:
p568
aVEasy is hard.
p569
aVPre-sweat the details for your audience.
p570
aVCount the taps.
p571
aVRemember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add,
p572
aVit's deciding what to leave out.
p573
aVAnd best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
p574
aa(lp575
VCA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.
p576
aa(lp577
VCA: Hear, hear!
