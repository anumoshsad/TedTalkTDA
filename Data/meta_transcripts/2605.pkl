VPlease meet Jane.
p4
aVShe has a high-risk pregnancy.
p5
aVWithin 24 weeks,
p6
aVshe's on bed rest at the hospital,
p7
aVbeing monitored for her preterm contractions.
p8
aa(lp9
VShe doesn't look the happiest.
p10
aVThat's in part because it requires technicians and experts
p11
aVto apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions.
p12
aVAnother reason Jane is not so happy is because she's worried.
p13
aVIn particular, she's worried about what happens
p14
aVafter her 10-day stay on bed rest at the hospital.
p15
aVWhat happens when she's home?
p16
aVIf she were to give birth this early it would be devastating.
p17
aVAs an African-American woman,
p18
aVshe's twice as likely to have a premature birth
p19
aVor to have a stillbirth.
p20
aVSo Jane basically has one of two options:
p21
aVstay at the hospital on bed rest,
p22
aVa prisoner to the technology until she gives birth,
p23
aVand then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill;
p24
aVor head home after her 10-day stay and hope for the best.
p25
aVNeither of these two options seems appealing.
p26
aa(lp27
VAs I began to think about stories like this
p28
aVand hear about stories like this,
p29
aVI began to ask myself and imagine:
p30
aVIs there an alternative?
p31
aVIs there a way we could have the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring
p32
aVthat we get with our trusted partners in the hospital
p33
aVwhile someone is at home living their daily life?
p34
aa(lp35
VWith that in mind,
p36
aVI encouraged people in my research group
p37
aVto partner with some clever material scientists,
p38
aVand all of us came together and brainstormed.
p39
aVAnd after a long process,
p40
aVwe came up with a vision, an idea,
p41
aVof a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry
p42
aVor you could apply to yourself like a Band-Aid.
p43
aVAnd after many trials and tribulations and years of endeavors,
p44
aVwe were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch
p45
aVthat was manufactured using the same processes
p46
aVthat they use to build computer chips,
p47
aVexcept the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer
p48
aVonto a flexible material that can interface with the human body.
p49
aa(lp50
VThese systems are about the thickness of a human hair.
p51
aVThey can measure the types of information that we want,
p52
aVthings such as:
p53
aVbodily movement,
p54
aVbodily temperature,
p55
aVelectrical rhythms of the body
p56
aVand so forth.
p57
aVWe can also engineer these systems,
p58
aVso they can integrate energy sources,
p59
aVand can have wireless transmission capabilities.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo as we began to build these types of systems,
p62
aVwe began to test them on ourselves in our research group.
p63
aVBut in addition, we began to reach out to some of our clinical partners
p64
aVin San Diego,
p65
aVand test these on different patients in different clinical conditions,
p66
aVincluding moms-to-be like Jane.
p67
aa(lp68
VHere is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital
p69
aVbeing monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional belt.
p70
aVIn addition,
p71
aVour flexible electronic patches are there.
p72
aVThis picture demonstrates waveforms pertaining to the fetal heart rate,
p73
aVwhere the red corresponds to what was acquired
p74
aVwith the conventional belts,
p75
aVand the blue corresponds to our estimates
p76
aVusing our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms.
p77
aa(lp78
VAt this moment,
p79
aVwe gave ourselves a big mental high five.
p80
aVSome of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition,
p81
aVand we were actually seeing this in a clinical context.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut there was still a problem.
p84
aVThe problem was, the way we manufactured these systems
p85
aVwas very inefficient,
p86
aVhad low yield
p87
aVand was very error-prone.
p88
aVIn addition,
p89
aVas we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital,
p90
aVthey encouraged us to make sure
p91
aVthat our electronics worked with typical medical adhesives
p92
aVthat are used in a hospital.
p93
aVWe had an epiphany and said, "Wait a minute.
p94
aVRather than just making them work with adhesives,
p95
aVlet's integrate them into adhesives,
p96
aVand that could solve our manufacturing problem."
p97
aa(lp98
VThis picture that you see here
p99
aVis our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of Scotch tape
p100
aVby simply peeling it off of a wafer.
p101
aVOngoing work in our research group allows us to, in addition,
p102
aVembed integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives
p103
aVto do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them,
p104
aVprocessing them
p105
aVand encoding for wireless transmission.
p106
aVAll of this integrated into the same medical adhesives
p107
aVthat are used in the hospital.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo when we reached this point,
p110
aVwe had some other challenges,
p111
aVfrom both an engineering as well as a usability perspective,
p112
aVto make sure that we could make it used practically.
p113
aa(lp114
VIn many digital health discussions,
p115
aVpeople believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data,
p116
aVwirelessly transmit it,
p117
aVsend it to the cloud,
p118
aVand in the cloud,
p119
aVwe can extract meaningful information for interpretation.
p120
aVAnd indeed, you can do all of that,
p121
aVif you're not worried about some of the energy challenges.
p122
aVThink about Jane for a moment.
p123
aVShe doesn't live in Palo Alto,
p124
aVnor does she live in Beverly Hills.
p125
aVWhat that means is,
p126
aVwe have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost
p127
aVfor her to be sending out a continuous stream of data.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere's another challenge
p130
aVthat not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about.
p131
aVAnd that is, that Jane does not have the most trust
p132
aVin the medical establishment.
p133
aVShe, people like her, her ancestors, have not had the best experiences
p134
aVat the hands of doctors and the hospital
p135
aVor insurance companies.
p136
aVThat means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy.
p137
aVJane might not feel that happy
p138
aVabout all that data being processed into the cloud.
p139
aVAnd Jane cannot be fooled;
p140
aVshe reads the news.
p141
aVShe knows that if the federal government can be hacked,
p142
aVif the Fortune 500 can be hacked,
p143
aVso can her doctor.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd so with that in mind,
p146
aVwe had an epiphany.
p147
aVWe cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world,
p148
aVbut perhaps we can present them a smaller target.
p149
aVWhat if we could actually,
p150
aVrather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation
p151
aVrun in the cloud,
p152
aVwhat if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits
p153
aVembedded into those adhesives?
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd so when we integrate these things together,
p156
aVwhat this means is that now we can think about the future
p157
aVwhere someone like Jane can still go about living her normal daily life,
p158
aVshe can be monitored,
p159
aVit can be done in a way where she doesn't have to get another job
p160
aVto pay her data plan,
p161
aVand we can also address some of her concerns about privacy.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo at this point,
p164
aVwe're feeling very good about ourselves.
p165
aVWe've accomplished this,
p166
aVwe've begun to address some of these questions about privacy
p167
aVand we feel like, pretty much the chapter is closed now.
p168
aVEveryone lived happily ever after, right?
p169
aVWell, not so fast.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VOne of the things we have to remember, as I mentioned earlier,
p174
aVis that Jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment.
p175
aVWe have to remember
p176
aVthat there are increasing and widening health disparities,
p177
aVand there's inequity in terms of proper care management.
p178
aVAnd so what that means is that this simple picture
p179
aVof Jane and her data \u2014
p180
aVeven with her being comfortable being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,
p181
aVletting a doctor intervene if necessary \u2014
p182
aVis not the whole story.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo what we're beginning to do
p185
aVis to think about ways to have trusted parties serve as intermediaries
p186
aVbetween people like Jane and her health care providers.
p187
aVFor example, we've begun to partner with churches
p188
aVand to think about nurses that are church members,
p189
aVthat come from that trusted community,
p190
aVas patient advocates and health coaches to people like Jane.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnother thing we have going for us
p193
aVis that insurance companies, increasingly,
p194
aVare attracted to some of these ideas.
p195
aVThey're increasingly realizing
p196
aVthat perhaps it's better to pay one dollar now
p197
aVfor a wearable device and a health coach,
p198
aVrather than paying 10 dollars later,
p199
aVwhen that baby is born prematurely
p200
aVand ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit \u2014
p201
aVone of the most expensive parts of a hospital.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis has been a long learning process for us.
p204
aVThis iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem
p205
aVand not feeling totally comfortable,
p206
aVand identifying the next problem,
p207
aVhas helped us go along this path
p208
aVof actually trying to not only innovate with this technology
p209
aVbut make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnother learning lesson we've taken from this process
p212
aVthat is very humbling,
p213
aVis that as technology progresses and advances at an accelerating rate,
p214
aVwe have to remember that human beings are using this technology,
p215
aVand we have to be mindful
p216
aVthat these human beings \u2014 they have a face,
p217
aVthey have a name
p218
aVand a life.
p219
aVAnd in the case of Jane,
p220
aVhopefully, two.
p221
aa(lp222
VThank you.
