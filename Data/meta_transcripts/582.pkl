VI want to share with you
p4
aVsome ideas about the secret power of time,
p5
aVin a very short time.
p6
aa(lp7
VVideo: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.
p8
aVKeep it quiet please. Settle down.
p9
aVIt's about time. End sequence. Take one.
p10
aV15 seconds studio.
p11
aV10, nine, eight, seven,
p12
aVsix, five, four, three, two ...

VPhilip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation
p15
aVof the principals in Adam's temptation.
p16
aV"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."
p17
aV"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."
p18
aV"I don't know, guys.
p19
aVI don't want to get in trouble."
p20
aV"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VLife is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,
p24
aVyes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,
p25
aVpresent focus and future focus.
p26
aVPromised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
p27
aa(lp28
VOf teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage \u2014
p29
aVthank you George Bush \u2014
p30
aVthe majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
p31
aVAnd most of them did so without using birth control.
p32
aVSo much for promises.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.
p35
aVThey can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait
p36
aVuntil the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
p37
aVOf course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
p38
aVWhat happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
p39
aVThey cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
p40
aVThey resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
p41
aa(lp42
VWalter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,
p43
aVwent back 14 years later,
p44
aVto try to discover what was different about those kids.
p45
aVThere were enormous differences between kids who resisted
p46
aVand kids who yielded, in many ways.
p47
aVThe kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
p48
aVThat's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
p49
aVThey didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
p50
aVThey were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,
p51
aVthe key for you,
p52
aVis, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.
p55
aVTime perspective is the study of how individuals,
p56
aVall of us, divide the flow of your human experience
p57
aVinto time zones or time categories.
p58
aVAnd you do it automatically and non-consciously.
p59
aVThey vary between cultures, between nations,
p60
aVbetween individuals, between social classes,
p61
aVbetween education levels.
p62
aVAnd the problem is that they can become biased,
p63
aVbecause you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhat determines any decision you make?
p66
aVYou make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
p67
aVFor some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,
p68
aVwhat other people are doing and what you're feeling.
p69
aVAnd those people, when they make their decisions in that format \u2014
p70
aVwe're going to call them "present-oriented,"
p71
aVbecause their focus is what is now.
p72
aa(lp73
VFor others, the present is irrelevant.
p74
aVIt's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
p75
aVSo that their decisions are based on past memories.
p76
aVAnd we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
p77
aa(lp78
VFor others it's not the past, it's not the present,
p79
aVit's only about the future.
p80
aVTheir focus is always about anticipated consequences.
p81
aVCost-benefit analysis.
p82
aVWe're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, time paradox, I want to argue,
p85
aVthe paradox of time perspective,
p86
aVis something that influences every decision you make,
p87
aVyou're totally unaware of.
p88
aVNamely, the extent to which you have one of these
p89
aVbiased time perspectives.
p90
aVWell there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
p91
aVThere is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
p92
aVYou can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
p93
aVYou can be present-hedonistic,
p94
aVnamely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist \u2014
p95
aVit doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
p96
aVYou can be future-oriented, setting goals.
p97
aVOr you can be transcendental future:
p98
aVnamely, life begins after death.
p99
aVDeveloping the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly
p100
aVdepending on the demands of the situation,
p101
aVthat's what you've got to learn to do.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?
p104
aVHigh on past-positive. Moderately high on future.
p105
aVAnd moderate on present-hedonism.
p106
aVAnd always low on past-negative
p107
aVand present-fatalism.
p108
aVSo the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past \u2014
p109
aVpast-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
p110
aVWhat you get from the future is wings
p111
aVto soar to new destinations, new challenges.
p112
aVWhat you get from the present hedonism
p113
aVis the energy, the energy to explore yourself,
p114
aVplaces, people, sensuality.
p115
aa(lp116
VAny time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.
p117
aVWhat do futures sacrifice for success?
p118
aVThey sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.
p119
aVThey sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.
p120
aVThey sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
p121
aVAnd they live for work, achievement and control.
p122
aVI'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,
p126
aVa Sicilian family \u2014 everyone lived in the past and present.
p127
aVI'm here as a future-oriented person
p128
aVwho went over the top, who did all these sacrifices
p129
aVbecause teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
p130
aVTold me don't eat that marshmallow,
p131
aVbecause if you wait you're going to get two of them,
p132
aVuntil I learned to balance out.
p133
aVI've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,
p134
aVso, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,
p135
aVand I'm happier than I have ever been.
p136
aa(lp137
VI just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:
p138
aVchanging the drop-out rates of school kids,
p139
aVcombating addictions, enhancing teen health,
p140
aVcuring vets' PTSD with time metaphors \u2014 getting miracle cures \u2014
p141
aVpromoting sustainability and conservation,
p142
aVreducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,
p143
aValtering appeals to suicidal terrorists,
p144
aVand modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo I want to end by saying:
p147
aVmany of life's puzzles can be solved
p148
aVby understanding your time perspective and that of others.
p149
aVAnd the idea is so simple, so obvious,
p150
aVbut I think the consequences are really profound.
p151
aVThank you so much.
