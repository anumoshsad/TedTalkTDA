VI had a fire nine days ago.

aVMy archive:
p5
aV175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,
p6
aVall my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
p7
aVI'd collected \u2014
p8
aVI was a collector, major, big-time.
p9
aVIt's gone.
p10
aVI just looked at it,
p11
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p12
aVI mean, this was \u2014
p13
aVwas I my things?
p14
aVI always live in the present \u2014 I love the present.
p15
aa(lp16
VI cherish the future.
p17
aVAnd I was taught some strange thing as a kid,
p18
aVlike, you've got to make something good out of something bad.
p19
aVYou've got to make something good out of something bad.
p20
aVThis was bad! Man, I was \u2014
p21
aVI cough. I was sick.
p22
aVThat's my camera lens. The first one \u2014
p23
aVthe one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.
p24
aVThat's my feature film. "King, Murray"
p25
aVwon Cannes Film Festival 1970 \u2014
p26
aVthe only print I had.
p27
aVThat's my papers.
p28
aa(lp29
VThat was in minutes \u2014 20 minutes.
p30
aVEpiphany hit me. Something hit me.
p31
aV"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"
p32
aVI started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
p33
aVBy the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
p34
aV"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.
p35
aVThese are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,
p36
aVwhich opens in New York in two weeks
p37
aVdowntown.
p38
aVI called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
p39
aVThat's me at my desk.
p40
aVThat was a desk took 40-some years to build.
p41
aVYou know \u2014 all the stuff.
p42
aVThat's my daughter, Jean.
p43
aVShe came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
p44
aa(lp45
V"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.
p46
aVI want pieces. Bits and pieces."
p47
aVI came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,
p48
aVwhich I'm just starting to work on \u2014 my next project.
p49
aVThat's my sister. She took care of pictures,
p50
aVbecause I was a big collector of snapshot photography
p51
aVthat I believed said a lot.
p52
aVAnd those are some of the pictures that \u2014
p53
aVsomething was good about the burnt pictures.
p54
aVI didn't know. I looked at that \u2014
p55
aVI said, "Wow, is that better than the \u2014"
p56
aVThat's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.
p57
aVIt's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
p58
aVIdea about women.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!
p61
aVYou could cry about this." I really didn't.
p62
aVI just instead said,
p63
aV"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "
p64
aVAnd I appreciate this moment
p65
aVto come up on this stage with so many people
p66
aVwho've already given me so much solace,
p67
aVand just say to TEDsters:
p68
aVI'm proud of me. That I take something bad,
p69
aVI turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,
p70
aVall these pieces.
p71
aVThat's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.
p72
aVI was a big record collector \u2014
p73
aVthe records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,
p74
aVfilm burns. Film burns.
p75
aVI mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
p76
aVThe negatives are gone.
p77
aa(lp78
VThat's my father's letter to me, telling me to
p79
aVmarry the woman I first married when I was 20.
p80
aVThat's my daughter and me.
p81
aVShe's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
p82
aVThat's my house.
p83
aVMy family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.
p84
aVThat's my wife, Heidi,
p85
aVwho didn't take it as well as I did.
p86
aVMy children, Davey and Henry.
p87
aVMy son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo, my message to you folks,
p90
aVfrom my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance
p91
aVto share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.
p92
aVI came to live it, and I am living it.
p93
aVThat's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,
p94
aVjust 35 miles from here.
p95
aVThank you everybody.
