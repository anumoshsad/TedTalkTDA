VDoes anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?
p4
aVAny guesses? 1816.
p5
aVAnd what I can say is, in 2016,
p6
aVdoctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.
p7
aVThere's a whole lot better technology coming,
p8
aVand that's part of the change in medicine.
p9
aa(lp10
VWhat has changed our society
p11
aVhas been wireless devices.
p12
aVBut the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, let me give you some examples of this
p15
aVto kind of make this much more concrete.
p16
aVThis is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.
p17
aVAnd, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time
p18
aVa patient, an individual, anywhere in the world
p19
aVon your smartphone,
p20
aVwatching your rhythm \u2014 that's incredible,
p21
aVand it's with us today.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut that's just the beginning.
p24
aVYou check your email while you're sitting here.
p25
aVIn the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,
p26
aVall your vital signs: your heart rhythm,
p27
aVyour blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.
p28
aVThis is already available today.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis is AirStrip Technologies.
p31
aVIt's now wired \u2014 or I should say, wireless \u2014
p32
aVby taking the aggregate of these signals
p33
aVin the hospital, in the intensive care unit,
p34
aVand putting it on a smartphone for physicians.
p35
aVIf you're an expectant parent,
p36
aVwhat about the ability to monitor, continuously,
p37
aVfetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,
p38
aVand not having to worry so much that things are
p39
aVfine as the pregnancy,
p40
aVand moving over into the time of delivery?
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd then as we go further,
p43
aVtoday we have continuous glucose sensors.
p44
aVRight now, they are under the skin,
p45
aVbut in the future, they won't have to be implanted.
p46
aVAnd of course, the desired range \u2014 trying to keep glucose
p47
aVbetween 75 and less than 200,
p48
aVchecking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor \u2014
p49
aVyou'll see how that can impact diabetes.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd what about sleep?
p52
aVWe're going to zoom in on that a little bit.
p53
aVWe're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.
p54
aVWhat if, on your phone,
p55
aVwhich will be available in the next few weeks,
p56
aVyou had every minute of your sleep displayed?
p57
aVAnd this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.
p58
aVThe REM sleep, rapid eye movement,
p59
aVdream state, is in light green;
p60
aVand light is gray, light sleep;
p61
aVand deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,
p62
aVis that dark green.
p63
aa(lp64
VHow about counting every calorie?
p65
aVAnd this is ability, in real time, to actually take
p66
aVmeasurements of caloric intake
p67
aVas well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.
p70
aVBut what I want to get to, the next frontier,
p71
aVvery quickly, and why the stethoscope
p72
aVis on its way out,
p73
aVis because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,
p74
aVand the breath sounds, because now,
p75
aVintroduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.
p76
aVWhy is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.
p77
aVHere is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,
p78
aVand also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,
p79
aVand then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics \u2014
p82
aVthe key measurements of vital signs,
p83
aVand all those things in physiology \u2014 but also all the imaging
p84
aVthat one could look at in your smartphone.
p85
aVNow, this is an example of another obsolete technology,
p86
aVsoon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.
p87
aVTwenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.
p88
aVThis is now a little tiny patch.
p89
aVYou can put it on for two weeks
p90
aVand send it in the mail.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, how does this work? Well,
p93
aVthere is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors
p94
aVthat one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.
p95
aVAnd this sends a signal
p96
aVand it creates a body area network to a gateway.
p97
aVGateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,
p98
aVas today many of these things are dedicated gateways,
p99
aVbecause they are not so well integrated.
p100
aVThat signal goes to the web, the cloud,
p101
aVand then it can be processed and sent anywhere:
p102
aVto a caregiver, to a physician,
p103
aVback to the patient, etc.
p104
aVSo, that's basically very simplistic technology
p105
aVof how this works.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, I have this device on.
p108
aVI didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.
p109
aVThis is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,
p110
aVas you saw already,
p111
aVbut it also goes well beyond that.
p112
aVThis is me now. And you can see the ECG.
p113
aVBelow that's the actual heart rate and the trend;
p114
aVto the right of that is a bioconductant.
p115
aVThat's the fluid status,
p116
aVfluid status, that's really important
p117
aVif you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.
p118
aVAnd below that's temperature,
p119
aVand respiration, and oxygen,
p120
aVand then the position activity.
p121
aVSo, this is really striking, because this device
p122
aVmeasures seven things
p123
aVthat are very much vital signs
p124
aVfor monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd why is this important? Well,
p127
aVthis is the most expensive bed.
p128
aVWhat if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?
p129
aVWell, we can. First of all, heart failure
p130
aVis the number one reason
p131
aVfor hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.
p132
aVThe cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,
p133
aVwhich is 80 percent related to hospitalization.
p134
aVAnd in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay
p135
aVfor a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,
p136
aVis \u2014 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,
p137
aVand by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.
p138
aVSo, can we improve that? Well the idea is
p139
aVwe take this device that I'm wearing,
p140
aVand we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,
p141
aVrandomly assigned, versus 600 patients
p142
aVwho don't have active monitoring,
p143
aVand see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,
p144
aVand that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,
p145
aVand you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,
p146
aVbut that's a type of wireless device trial
p147
aVthat could change medicine in the years ahead.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhy now? Why has this all of a sudden become
p150
aVa reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?
p151
aVWhat we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.
p152
aVThis sets up consumer-driven healthcare.
p153
aVThat's where this is all starting.
p154
aVLet me just give you specifics about why this is
p155
aVa big movement if you're not aware of it:
p156
aV1.2 million Americans
p157
aVhave gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network
p158
aVthat connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.
p159
aVAnd this Wired Magazine cover article
p160
aVreally captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe
p161
aVand how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology
p162
aVand energy expenditure.
p163
aVHere are some things, the principles
p164
aVthat are guiding principles to keep in mind:
p165
aV"A data-driven health revolution
p166
aVpromises to make us all
p167
aVbetter, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."
p168
aVAnd this one, which is really telling,
p169
aVthis was from July, this cover article:
p170
aa(lp171
V"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond
p172
aVdiet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet
p173
aVof life, from sleep to mood to pain,
p174
aV24/7/365."
p175
aVWell, I tried this device.
p176
aVA lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.
p177
aVI didn't have one of those,
p178
aVbut I got the Fitbit.
p179
aVThat looks like this.
p180
aVIt's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.
p181
aVAnd I want to just give you the results of that testing,
p182
aVbecause I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.
p183
aVI hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better \u2014
p184
aVI hope so.
p185
aVBut this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.
p186
aVHowever you have to put in most of this stuff.
p187
aVThe only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,
p188
aVand even then, it's not complete.
p189
aVSo, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.
p190
aVYou put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,
p191
aVand of course it tells you how many calories you're expending
p192
aVfrom the exercise, and how many you took in,
p193
aVif you go in and enter all the foods.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut it really wants you to enter all your activity.
p196
aVAnd so I went to this,
p197
aVand of course I was gratified that it picked up
p198
aVthe 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,
p199
aVbut then it wants more information.
p200
aVSo, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.
p201
aVHow long did you do it for?"
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aVAnd it says, "How hard was it?"
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVFurthermore it says, "Start time."
p206
aVNow, this doesn't appear \u2014 this just doesn't work,
p207
aVI mean, this just doesn't work.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, now I want to move to sleep.
p210
aVWho would ever have thought you could have your own EEG
p211
aVat your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?
p212
aVThis is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.
p213
aVIt monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.
p214
aVSo, I did this thing for seven days
p215
aVgetting ready for TEDMed.
p216
aVThis is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.
p217
aa(lp218
VOf course how many here
p219
aVhave any problems with sleeping?
p220
aVIt's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.
p221
aVOkay, well this was a week of
p222
aVmy life in sleeping,
p223
aVand you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,
p224
aVyou get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.
p225
aVYou say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score
p226
aVis adjusted to age,
p227
aVand you want to get as high as you possibly can.
p228
aVSo this is the moment-by-moment,
p229
aVor minute-by-minute sleep.
p230
aVAnd you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.
p231
aVAnd the wake time is in orange.
p232
aVAnd this can be a problem, as I learned.
p233
aVBecause it not only helps you with quantifying
p234
aVyour sleep,
p235
aVbut also tells others you're awake.
p236
aVSo, when my wife came in and she
p237
aVcould tell you're awake.
p238
aV"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."
p239
aVAnd I'm trying to play possum.
p240
aVThis thing is very, very impressive.
p241
aa(lp242
VOK. So, that's the first night.
p243
aVAnd this one is now 67,
p244
aVand that's not a good score.
p245
aVAnd this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,
p246
aVin deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.
p247
aVThis was really fascinating because
p248
aVthis gave that quantitation
p249
aVabout all the different phases of sleep.
p250
aVSo, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.
p251
aVIt's like a managed competition of sleep.
p252
aVAnd really interesting stuff.
p253
aVLook at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,
p254
aVbut actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?
p255
aVAnd the key thing was, what I didn't know,
p256
aVwas that I was a really good dreamer.
p257
aa(lp258
VOK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.
p259
aVEighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,
p260
aVor 80 percent of age greater than 65 have
p261
aVtwo or more chronic disease,
p262
aV140 million Americans
p263
aVhave one or more chronic disease,
p264
aVand 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion
p265
aVexpenditures are related to chronic disease.
p266
aVNow, diabetes is one of the big ones.
p267
aVAlmost 24 million people have diabetes.
p268
aVAnd here is the latest map. It was published
p269
aVjust a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,
p270
aVand it isn't looking good.
p271
aVThat is, for men, 29 percent
p272
aVin the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,
p273
aVand women, although it's less, it's terribly high.
p274
aa(lp275
VBut of course we have a way to measure that now
p276
aVon a continuous basis,
p277
aVwith a sensor that detects blood glucose,
p278
aVand it's important because we could detect
p279
aVhyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,
p280
aVand also hypoglycemia.
p281
aVAnd you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,
p282
aVwere finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut by continuous monitoring,
p285
aVit captures all that vital information.
p286
aVThe future of this though,
p287
aVis being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,
p288
aVand that's not so far away.
p289
aVSo, let me just give you, very quickly,
p290
aV10 top targets for wireless medicine.
p291
aVAll these things are possible \u2014
p292
aVsome of them are very close,
p293
aVor already, as you heard,
p294
aVare available today, in some way or form.
p295
aa(lp296
VAlzheimer's disease:
p297
aVthere's five million people affected, and you can check
p298
aVvital signs, activity, balance.
p299
aVAsthma: large number, we could detect things like
p300
aVpollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,
p301
aVI'll show you an example of that real quickly.
p302
aVChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
p303
aVDepression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.
p304
aVDiabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:
p305
aV74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring
p306
aVto come up with much better management and prevention.
p307
aVAnd obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.
p308
aVAnd sleep disorders.
p309
aa(lp310
VThis is effective around the world. The access to smartphones
p311
aVand cell phones today is extraordinary.
p312
aVAnd this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully
p313
aVabout the opportunities in health across the developing world:
p314
aV"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,
p315
aVmore quickly, than any previous technology."
p316
aVAnd that's before we got going on the m-health world.
p317
aVAging: The problem is enormous,
p318
aV300,000 broken hips per year;
p319
aVbut the solutions are extraordinary,
p320
aVand they include so many different things.
p321
aa(lp322
VOne of the ones I just wanted to mention:
p323
aVThe iShoe is another example of a sensor that
p324
aVimproves proprioception among the elderly
p325
aVto prevent falling.
p326
aVOne of many different techniques using wireless sensors.
p327
aVSo, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,
p328
aVacross the ages from premies or unborn children
p329
aVto seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;
p330
aVthe full spectrum of disease \u2014 I hope I've given you a sense of that \u2014
p331
aVacross the globe.
p332
aa(lp333
VThere are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.
p334
aVOne of them \u2014 we're very fortunate \u2014 is to develop a dedicated institute
p335
aVand that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...
p336
aVand then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,
p337
aVto get behind this wireless health institute.
p338
aVSan Diego is an extraordinary place for this.
p339
aVThere's over 650 wireless companies,
p340
aV100 of which or more are working in wireless health.
p341
aVIt's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly
p342
aVit dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.
p343
aa(lp344
VThe wireless institute,
p345
aVthe West Wireless Health Institute,
p346
aVis really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people
p347
aVwho are here this evening:
p348
aVGary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.
p349
aV(Applause)
p350
aVTheir fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,
p351
aVand this is really a nonprofit education center
p352
aVwhich is just about to open. It looks like this,
p353
aVthis whole building dedicated.
p354
aVAnd what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:
p355
aVto take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate \u2014
p356
aVand we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,
p357
aVit was announced on Monday \u2014
p358
aVthen to move up with development,
p359
aVclinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,
p360
aVthe most challenging thing of all,
p361
aVrequiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.
p362
aa(lp363
VThe other big thing, besides having this fantastic
p364
aVinstitute to catalyze this process
p365
aVis guidance,
p366
aVand that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.
p367
aVIf we understand biology from genomics and omics
p368
aVand wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.
p369
aVBecause what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.
p370
aVOver 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,
p371
aVbut this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about
p372
aVthe underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years
p373
aVthan in the history of man.
p374
aVAnd when you put that together with, for example,
p375
aVnow an app for the iPhone with your genotype
p376
aVto guide drug therapy ...
p377
aVbut, the future \u2014 we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes
p378
aVfrom all the common variants,
p379
aVand that's going to get filled in more
p380
aVwith low-frequency variants in the future.
p381
aVWe can tell who's going to get breast cancer
p382
aVfrom the various genes.
p383
aVWe can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.
p386
aVEach of these has a sensor.
p387
aVWe can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.
p388
aVWe can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,
p389
aVfor breast cancer with an ultrasound device
p390
aVgiven to the patient.
p391
aVAn iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.
p392
aVAnd vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.
p393
aVWe lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.
p394
aa(lp395
VSo, I hope I've convinced you of this,
p396
aVof the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound
p397
aVand then the impact on diseases is equally impressive
p398
aVacross all these different diseases and more.
p399
aVIt's really taking individualized medicine to a new height
p400
aVand it's hyper-innovative,
p401
aVand I think it represents the black swan of medicine.
p402
aVThanks for your attention.
