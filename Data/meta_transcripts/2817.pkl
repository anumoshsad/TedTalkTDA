VJust over a year ago,
p4
aVfor the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.
p5
aVI was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
p6
aVI remember a sense of detachment and falling apart
p7
aVand a coldness.
p8
aVAnd then I was back, drowsy and disoriented,
p9
aVbut definitely there.
p10
aVNow, when you wake from a deep sleep,
p11
aVyou might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping,
p12
aVbut there's always a basic sense of time having passed,
p13
aVof a continuity between then and now.
p14
aVComing round from anesthesia is very different.
p15
aVI could have been under for five minutes, five hours,
p16
aVfive years or even 50 years.
p17
aVI simply wasn't there.
p18
aVIt was total oblivion.
p19
aVAnesthesia \u2014 it's a modern kind of magic.
p20
aVIt turns people into objects,
p21
aVand then, we hope, back again into people.
p22
aVAnd in this process
p23
aVis one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.
p24
aa(lp25
VHow does consciousness happen?
p26
aVSomehow, within each of our brains,
p27
aVthe combined activity of many billions of neurons,
p28
aVeach one a tiny biological machine,
p29
aVis generating a conscious experience.
p30
aVAnd not just any conscious experience \u2014
p31
aVyour conscious experience right here and right now.
p32
aVHow does this happen?
p33
aa(lp34
VAnswering this question is so important
p35
aVbecause consciousness for each of us is all there is.
p36
aVWithout it there's no world,
p37
aVthere's no self,
p38
aVthere's nothing at all.
p39
aVAnd when we suffer, we suffer consciously
p40
aVwhether it's through mental illness or pain.
p41
aVAnd if we can experience joy and suffering,
p42
aVwhat about other animals?
p43
aVMight they be conscious, too?
p44
aVDo they also have a sense of self?
p45
aVAnd as computers get faster and smarter,
p46
aVmaybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away,
p47
aVwhen my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.
p48
aa(lp49
VI actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
p50
aVAnd I think this because my research is telling me
p51
aVthat consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence
p52
aVand more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.
p53
aVConsciousness and intelligence are very different things.
p54
aVYou don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn the story I'm going to tell you,
p57
aVour conscious experiences of the world around us,
p58
aVand of ourselves within it,
p59
aVare kinds of controlled hallucinations
p60
aVthat happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, you might have heard that we know nothing
p63
aVabout how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
p64
aVSome people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.
p65
aVBut in fact,
p66
aVthe last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.
p67
aVIf you come to my lab at the University of Sussex,
p68
aVyou'll find scientists from all different disciplines
p69
aVand sometimes even philosophers.
p70
aVAll of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens
p71
aVand what happens when it goes wrong.
p72
aVAnd the strategy is very simple.
p73
aVI'd like you to think about consciousness
p74
aVin the way that we've come to think about life.
p75
aVAt one time, people thought the property of being alive
p76
aVcould not be explained by physics and chemistry \u2014
p77
aVthat life had to be more than just mechanism.
p78
aVBut people no longer think that.
p79
aVAs biologists got on with the job
p80
aVof explaining the properties of living systems
p81
aVin terms of physics and chemistry \u2014
p82
aVthings like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis \u2014
p83
aVthe basic mystery of what life is started to fade away,
p84
aVand people didn't propose any more magical solutions,
p85
aVlike a force of life or an élan vital.
p86
aVSo as with life, so with consciousness.
p87
aVOnce we start explaining its properties
p88
aVin terms of things happening inside brains and bodies,
p89
aVthe apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is
p90
aVshould start to fade away.
p91
aVAt least that's the plan.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo let's get started.
p94
aVWhat are the properties of consciousness?
p95
aVWhat should a science of consciousness try to explain?
p96
aVWell, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.
p97
aVThere are experiences of the world around us,
p98
aVfull of sights, sounds and smells,
p99
aVthere's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.
p100
aVAnd then there's conscious self.
p101
aVThe specific experience of being you or being me.
p102
aVThe lead character in this inner movie,
p103
aVand probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.
p104
aVLet's start with experiences of the world around us,
p105
aVand with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
p106
aa(lp107
VImagine being a brain.
p108
aVYou're locked inside a bony skull,
p109
aVtrying to figure what's out there in the world.
p110
aVThere's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.
p111
aVAll you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses
p112
aVwhich are only indirectly related to things in the world,
p113
aVwhatever they may be.
p114
aVSo perception \u2014 figuring out what's there \u2014
p115
aVhas to be a process of informed guesswork
p116
aVin which the brain combines these sensory signals
p117
aVwith its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is
p118
aVto form its best guess of what caused those signals.
p119
aVThe brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
p120
aVWhat we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.
p121
aa(lp122
VLet me give you a couple of examples of all this.
p123
aVYou might have seen this illusion before,
p124
aVbut I'd like you to think about it in a new way.
p125
aVIf you look at those two patches, A and B,
p126
aVthey should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?
p127
aVBut they are in fact exactly the same shade.
p128
aVAnd I can illustrate this.
p129
aVIf I put up a second version of the image here
p130
aVand join the two patches with a gray-colored bar,
p131
aVyou can see there's no difference.
p132
aVIt's exactly the same shade of gray.
p133
aVAnd if you still don't believe me,
p134
aVI'll bring the bar across and join them up.
p135
aVIt's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.
p136
aVThis isn't any kind of magic trick.
p137
aVIt's the same shade of gray,
p138
aVbut take it away again, and it looks different.
p139
aVSo what's happening here
p140
aVis that the brain is using its prior expectations
p141
aVbuilt deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex
p142
aVthat a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface,
p143
aVso that we see B as lighter than it really is.
p144
aa(lp145
VHere's one more example,
p146
aVwhich shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions
p147
aVto change what we consciously experience.
p148
aVHave a listen to this.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Distorted voice)
p151
aa(lp152
VSounded strange, right?
p153
aVHave a listen again and see if you can get anything.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Distorted voice)
p156
aa(lp157
VStill strange.
p158
aVNow listen to this.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VWhich I do.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo you heard some words there, right?
p167
aVNow listen to the first sound again. I'm just going to replay it.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Distorted voice)
p170
aa(lp171
VYeah? So you can now hear words there.
p172
aVOnce more for luck.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Distorted voice)
p175
aa(lp176
VOK, so what's going on here?
p177
aVThe remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain
p178
aVhasn't changed at all.
p179
aVAll that's changed is your brain's best guess
p180
aVof the causes of that sensory information.
p181
aVAnd that changes what you consciously hear.
p182
aVAll this puts the brain basis of perception
p183
aVin a bit of a different light.
p184
aVInstead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain
p185
aVfrom the outside world,
p186
aVit depends as much, if not more,
p187
aVon perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.
p188
aVWe don't just passively perceive the world,
p189
aVwe actively generate it.
p190
aVThe world we experience comes as much, if not more,
p191
aVfrom the inside out
p192
aVas from the outside in.
p193
aa(lp194
VLet me give you one more example of perception
p195
aVas this active, constructive process.
p196
aVHere we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing
p197
aVto simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions
p198
aVon experience.
p199
aVIn this panoramic video, we've transformed the world \u2014
p200
aVwhich is in this case Sussex campus \u2014
p201
aVinto a psychedelic playground.
p202
aVWe've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
p203
aVto simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.
p204
aVIn this case, to see dogs.
p205
aVAnd you can see this is a very strange thing.
p206
aVWhen perceptual predictions are too strong,
p207
aVas they are here,
p208
aVthe result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations
p209
aVpeople might report in altered states,
p210
aVor perhaps even in psychosis.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, think about this for a minute.
p213
aVIf hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception,
p214
aVthen perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination,
p215
aVbut a controlled hallucination
p216
aVin which the brain's predictions are being reigned in
p217
aVby sensory information from the world.
p218
aVIn fact, we're all hallucinating all the time,
p219
aVincluding right now.
p220
aVIt's just that when we agree about our hallucinations,
p221
aVwe call that reality.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VNow I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self,
p226
aVthe specific experience of being you,
p227
aVis also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.
p228
aVThis seems a very strange idea, right?
p229
aVYes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes,
p230
aVbut how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?
p231
aVFor most of us,
p232
aVthe experience of being a person
p233
aVis so familiar, so unified and so continuous
p234
aVthat it's difficult not to take it for granted.
p235
aVBut we shouldn't take it for granted.
p236
aVThere are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.
p237
aVThere's the experience of having a body
p238
aVand of being a body.
p239
aVThere are experiences of perceiving the world
p240
aVfrom a first person point of view.
p241
aVThere are experiences of intending to do things
p242
aVand of being the cause of things that happen in the world.
p243
aVAnd there are experiences
p244
aVof being a continuous and distinctive person over time,
p245
aVbuilt from a rich set of memories and social interactions.
p246
aa(lp247
VMany experiments show,
p248
aVand psychiatrists and neurologists know very well,
p249
aVthat these different ways in which we experience being a self
p250
aVcan all come apart.
p251
aVWhat this means is the basic background experience
p252
aVof being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.
p253
aVAnother experience, which just like all others,
p254
aVrequires explanation.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo let's return to the bodily self.
p257
aVHow does the brain generate the experience of being a body
p258
aVand of having a body?
p259
aVWell, just the same principles apply.
p260
aVThe brain makes its best guess
p261
aVabout what is and what is not part of its body.
p262
aVAnd there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.
p263
aVAnd unlike most neuroscience experiments,
p264
aVthis is one you can do at home.
p265
aVAll you need is one of these.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd a couple of paintbrushes.
p270
aa(lp271
VIn the rubber hand illusion,
p272
aVa person's real hand is hidden from view,
p273
aVand that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.
p274
aVThen both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush
p275
aVwhile the person stares at the fake hand.
p276
aVNow, for most people, after a while,
p277
aVthis leads to the very uncanny sensation
p278
aVthat the fake hand is in fact part of their body.
p279
aVAnd the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch
p280
aVon an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be,
p281
aVis enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess
p282
aVthat the fake hand is in fact part of the body.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VSo you can measure all kinds of clever things.
p287
aVYou can measure skin conductance and startle responses,
p288
aVbut there's no need.
p289
aVIt's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.
p290
aVThis means that even experiences of what our body is
p291
aVis a kind of best guessing \u2014
p292
aVa kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.
p293
aa(lp294
VThere's one more thing.
p295
aVWe don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside,
p296
aVwe also experience them from within.
p297
aVWe all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.
p298
aVAnd sensory signals coming from the inside of the body
p299
aVare continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs,
p300
aVhow the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like,
p301
aVlots of things.
p302
aVThis kind of perception, which we call interoception,
p303
aVis rather overlooked.
p304
aVBut it's critically important
p305
aVbecause perception and regulation of the internal state of the body \u2014
p306
aVwell, that's what keeps us alive.
p307
aa(lp308
VHere's another version of the rubber hand illusion.
p309
aVThis is from our lab at Sussex.
p310
aVAnd here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand,
p311
aVwhich flashes red and back
p312
aVeither in time or out of time with their heartbeat.
p313
aVAnd when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat,
p314
aVpeople have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.
p315
aVSo experiences of having a body are deeply grounded
p316
aVin perceiving our bodies from within.
p317
aa(lp318
VThere's one last thing I want to draw your attention to,
p319
aVwhich is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different
p320
aVfrom experiences of the world around us.
p321
aVWhen I look around me, the world seems full of objects \u2014
p322
aVtables, chairs, rubber hands,
p323
aVpeople, you lot \u2014
p324
aVeven my own body in the world,
p325
aVI can perceive it as an object from the outside.
p326
aVBut my experiences of the body from within,
p327
aVthey're not like that at all.
p328
aVI don't perceive my kidneys here,
p329
aVmy liver here,
p330
aVmy spleen ...
p331
aVI don't know where my spleen is,
p332
aVbut it's somewhere.
p333
aVI don't perceive my insides as objects.
p334
aVIn fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.
p335
aVAnd this is important, I think.
p336
aVPerception of the internal state of the body
p337
aVisn't about figuring out what's there,
p338
aVit's about control and regulation \u2014
p339
aVkeeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds
p340
aVthat are compatible with survival.
p341
aVWhen the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there,
p342
aVwe perceive objects as the causes of sensations.
p343
aVWhen the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things,
p344
aVwe experience how well or how badly that control is going.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo our most basic experiences of being a self,
p347
aVof being an embodied organism,
p348
aVare deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
p349
aVAnd when we follow this idea all the way through,
p350
aVwe can start to see that all of our conscious experiences,
p351
aVsince they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception,
p352
aVall stem from this basic drive to stay alive.
p353
aVWe experience the world and ourselves
p354
aVwith, through and because of our living bodies.
p355
aa(lp356
VLet me bring things together step-by-step.
p357
aVWhat we consciously see depends
p358
aVon the brain's best guess of what's out there.
p359
aVOur experienced world comes from the inside out,
p360
aVnot just the outside in.
p361
aVThe rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences
p362
aVof what is and what is not our body.
p363
aVAnd these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals
p364
aVcoming from deep inside the body.
p365
aVAnd finally,
p366
aVexperiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation
p367
aVthan figuring out what's there.
p368
aVSo our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it \u2014
p369
aVwell, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations
p370
aVthat have been shaped over millions of years of evolution
p371
aVto keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
p372
aVWe predict ourselves into existence.
p373
aa(lp374
VNow, I leave you with three implications of all this.
p375
aVFirst, just as we can misperceive the world,
p376
aVwe can misperceive ourselves
p377
aVwhen the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
p378
aVUnderstanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
p379
aVbecause we can finally get at the mechanisms
p380
aVrather than just treating the symptoms
p381
aVin conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
p382
aa(lp383
VSecond:
p384
aVwhat it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to
p385
aVa software program running on a robot,
p386
aVhowever smart or sophisticated.
p387
aVWe are biological, flesh-and-blood animals
p388
aVwhose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels
p389
aVby the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
p390
aVJust making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.
p391
aa(lp392
VFinally,
p393
aVour own individual inner universe,
p394
aVour way of being conscious,
p395
aVis just one possible way of being conscious.
p396
aVAnd even human consciousness generally \u2014
p397
aVit's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.
p398
aVOur individual self and worlds are unique to each of us,
p399
aVbut they're all grounded in biological mechanisms
p400
aVshared with many other living creatures.
p401
aa(lp402
VNow, these are fundamental changes
p403
aVin how we understand ourselves,
p404
aVbut I think they should be celebrated,
p405
aVbecause as so often in science, from Copernicus \u2014
p406
aVwe're not at the center of the universe \u2014
p407
aVto Darwin \u2014
p408
aVwe're related to all other creatures \u2014
p409
aVto the present day.
p410
aVWith a greater sense of understanding
p411
aVcomes a greater sense of wonder,
p412
aVand a greater realization
p413
aVthat we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.
p414
aVAnd ...
p415
aVwhen the end of consciousness comes,
p416
aVthere's nothing to be afraid of.
p417
aVNothing at all.
