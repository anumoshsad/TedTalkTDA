VI'm here to talk to you
p4
aVabout the economic invisibility of nature.
p5
aVThe bad news
p6
aVis that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,
p7
aVso those invoices don't get issued.
p8
aVBut we need to do something about this problem.
p9
aVI began my life as a markets professional
p10
aVand continued to take an interest,
p11
aVbut most of my recent effort
p12
aVhas been looking at the value
p13
aVof what comes to human beings from nature,
p14
aVand which doesn't get priced by the markets.
p15
aa(lp16
VA project called TEEB was started in 2007,
p17
aVand it was launched by a group of environment ministers
p18
aVof the G8+5.
p19
aVAnd their basic inspiration
p20
aVwas a stern review of Lord Stern.
p21
aVThey asked themselves a question:
p22
aVIf economics could make such a convincing case
p23
aVfor early action on climate change,
p24
aVwell why can't the same be done for conservation?
p25
aVWhy can't an equivalent case be made
p26
aVfor nature?
p27
aVAnd the answer is: Yeah, it can.
p28
aVBut it's not that straightforward.
p29
aVBiodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.
p30
aVIt exists in many layers,
p31
aVecosystems, species and genes across many scales \u2014
p32
aVinternational, national, local, community \u2014
p33
aVand doing for nature
p34
aVwhat Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd yet, we began.
p37
aVWe began the project with an interim report,
p38
aVwhich quickly pulled together
p39
aVa lot of information that had been collected on the subject
p40
aVby many, many researchers.
p41
aVAnd amongst our compiled results
p42
aVwas the startling revelation
p43
aVthat, in fact, we were losing natural capital \u2014
p44
aVthe benefits that flow from nature to us.
p45
aVWe were losing it at an extraordinary rate \u2014
p46
aVin fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth
p47
aVof natural capital.
p48
aVThis came out in 2008,
p49
aVwhich was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown
p50
aVthat we had lost financial capital
p51
aVof the order of two and a half trillion dollars.
p52
aVSo this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.
p53
aVWe then have gone on since
p54
aVto present for [the] international community,
p55
aVfor governments,
p56
aVfor local governments and for business
p57
aVand for people, for you and me,
p58
aVa whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,
p59
aVwhich address the economic invisibility of nature
p60
aVand describe what can be done to solve it.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhat is this about?
p63
aVA picture that you're familiar with \u2014
p64
aVthe Amazon rainforests.
p65
aVIt's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,
p66
aVbut what people don't really know
p67
aVis this also is a rain factory.
p68
aVBecause the northeastern trade winds,
p69
aVas they go over the Amazonas,
p70
aVeffectively gather the water vapor.
p71
aVSomething like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor
p72
aVis sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,
p73
aVand eventually precipitates in the form of rain
p74
aVacross the La Plata Basin.
p75
aVThis rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,
p76
aVeffectively feeds an agricultural economy
p77
aVof the order of 240 billion dollars-worth
p78
aVin Latin America.
p79
aVBut the question arises: Okay, so how much
p80
aVdo Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina
p81
aVand indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil
p82
aVpay for that vital input to that economy
p83
aVto the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?
p84
aVAnd the answer is zilch,
p85
aVexactly zero.
p86
aVThat's the economic invisibility of nature.
p87
aVThat can't keep going on,
p88
aVbecause economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.
p89
aVEconomics has become the currency of policy.
p90
aVAnd unless we address
p91
aVthis invisibility,
p92
aVwe are going to get the results that we are seeing,
p93
aVwhich is a gradual degradation and loss
p94
aVof this valuable natural asset.
p95
aa(lp96
VIt's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.
p97
aVNo matter what level you look at,
p98
aVwhether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,
p99
aVwe see the same problem again and again.
p100
aVSo rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests
p101
aVat an ecosystem level.
p102
aVAt the species level,
p103
aVit's been estimated that insect-based pollination,
p104
aVbees pollinating fruit and so on,
p105
aVis something like 190 billion dollars-worth.
p106
aVThat's something like eight percent
p107
aVof the total agricultural output globally.
p108
aVIt completely passes below the radar screen.
p109
aVBut when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?
p110
aVOr for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,
p111
aV60 percent of medicines were prospected,
p112
aVwere found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.
p113
aVOnce again, most of that doesn't get paid.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd that brings me to another aspect of this,
p116
aVwhich is, to whom should this get paid?
p117
aVThat genetic material
p118
aVprobably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,
p119
aVto a local community of poor people
p120
aVwho parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,
p121
aVwhich then became the medicine.
p122
aVThey were the ones that didn't get paid.
p123
aVAnd if you look at the species level,
p124
aVyou saw about fish.
p125
aVToday, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant
p126
aVthat effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,
p127
aVthe artisanal fisher folk
p128
aVand those who fish for their own livelihoods,
p129
aVto feed their families.
p130
aVSomething like a billion people depend on fish,
p131
aVthe quantity of fish in the oceans.
p132
aVA billion people depend on fish
p133
aVfor their main source for animal protein.
p134
aVAnd at this rate at which we are losing fish,
p135
aVit is a human problem of enormous dimensions,
p136
aVa health problem
p137
aVof a kind we haven't seen before.
p138
aVAnd finally, at the ecosystem level,
p139
aVwhether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,
p140
aVor whether it is the ability of poor farmers
p141
aVto go out and gather leaf litter
p142
aVfor their cattle and goats,
p143
aVor whether it's the ability of their wives
p144
aVto go and collect fuel wood from the forest,
p145
aVit is actually the poor
p146
aVwho depend most on these ecosystem services.
p147
aa(lp148
VWe did estimates in our study
p149
aVthat for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,
p150
aVeven though ecosystem services \u2014
p151
aVthese benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free \u2014
p152
aVthey're not very big in percentage terms of GDP \u2014
p153
aVtwo, four, eight, 10, 15 percent \u2014
p154
aVbut in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,
p155
aVthe answers are more like
p156
aV45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.
p157
aVThat's the difference.
p158
aVBecause these are important benefits for the poor.
p159
aVAnd you can't really have a proper model for development
p160
aVif at the same time you're destroying or allowing
p161
aVthe degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,
p162
aVwhich is your development asset,
p163
aVthat is ecological infrastructure.
p164
aa(lp165
VHow bad can things get?
p166
aVWell here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.
p167
aVIt's basically a measure
p168
aVof how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average
p169
aVof biomass of various species are around.
p170
aVThe green represents the percentage.
p171
aVIf you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.
p172
aVIf it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.
p173
aVAnd these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,
p174
aVthe pre-industrial era, 1750.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow I'm going to show you
p177
aVhow business as usual will affect this.
p178
aVAnd just watch the change in colors
p179
aVin India, China, Europe,
p180
aVsub-Saharan Africa
p181
aVas we move on and consume global biomass
p182
aVat a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.
p183
aVSee that again.
p184
aVThe only places that remain green \u2014 and that's not good news \u2014
p185
aVis, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,
p186
aVlike the tundra and like the Sahara.
p187
aVBut that doesn't help because there were very few species
p188
aVand volume of biomass there in the first place.
p189
aVThis is the challenge.
p190
aVThe reason this is happening
p191
aVboils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,
p192
aVwhich is our inability to perceive the difference
p193
aVbetween public benefits
p194
aVand private profits.
p195
aVWe tend to constantly ignore public wealth
p196
aVsimply because it is in the common wealth,
p197
aVit's common goods.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd here's an example from Thailand
p200
aVwhere we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much \u2014
p201
aVit's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured \u2014
p202
aVcompared to its value as a shrimp farm,
p203
aVwhich is more like $9,600,
p204
aVthere has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves
p205
aVand convert them to shrimp farms.
p206
aVBut of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,
p207
aValmost 8,000 of those dollars
p208
aVare, in fact, subsidies.
p209
aVSo you compare the two sides of the coin
p210
aVand you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.
p211
aVThat's not that hard.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut on the other hand, if you start measuring,
p214
aVhow much would it actually cost
p215
aVto restore the land of the shrimp farm
p216
aVback to productive use?
p217
aVOnce salt deposition and chemical deposition
p218
aVhas had its effects,
p219
aVthat answer is more like $12,000 of cost.
p220
aVAnd if you see the benefits of the mangrove
p221
aVin terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get
p222
aVand in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,
p223
aVthat provide fish for the poor,
p224
aVthat answer is more like $11,000.
p225
aVSo now look at the different lens.
p226
aVIf you look at the lens of public wealth
p227
aVas against the lens of private profits,
p228
aVyou get a completely different answer,
p229
aVwhich is clearly conservation makes more sense,
p230
aVand not destruction.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo is this just a story from South Thailand?
p233
aVSorry, this is a global story.
p234
aVAnd here's what the same calculation looks like,
p235
aVwhich was done recently \u2014 well I say recently, over the last 10 years \u2014
p236
aVby a group called TRUCOST.
p237
aVAnd they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,
p238
aVwhat are the externalities?
p239
aVIn other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?
p240
aVThis is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,
p241
aVwhich causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.
p242
aVIt causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,
p243
aVhealth cost and so on.
p244
aVUse of freshwater.
p245
aVIf you drill water to make coke near a village farm,
p246
aVthat's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.
p247
aa(lp248
VCan we stop this, and how?
p249
aVI think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.
p250
aVBasically the stuff of life is natural capital,
p251
aVand we need to recognize and build that into our systems.
p252
aVWhen we measure GDP
p253
aVas a measure of economic performance at the national level,
p254
aVwe don't include our biggest asset at the country level.
p255
aVWhen we measure corporate performances,
p256
aVwe don't include our impacts on nature
p257
aVand what our business costs society.
p258
aVThat has to stop.
p259
aVIn fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.
p260
aVI began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.
p261
aVThat was in the early 2000s
p262
aVwhen India was going gung-ho about GDP growth
p263
aVas the means forward \u2014
p264
aVlooking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent
p265
aVand wondering, why can we do the same?
p266
aVAnd a few friends of mine and I
p267
aVdecided this doesn't make sense.
p268
aVThis is going to create more cost to society and more losses.
p269
aVSo we decided to do a massive set of calculations
p270
aVand started producing green accounts for India and its states.
p271
aVThat's how my interests began
p272
aVand went to the TEEB project.
p273
aVCalculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.
p274
aVAnd the World Bank has acknowledged this
p275
aVand they've started a project called WAVES \u2014
p276
aVWealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.
p277
aa(lp278
VBut calculating this at the next level,
p279
aVthat means at the business sector level, is important.
p280
aVAnd actually we've done this with the TEEB project.
p281
aVWe've done this for a very difficult case,
p282
aVwhich was for deforestation in China.
p283
aVThis is important, because in China in 1997,
p284
aVthe Yellow River actually went dry for nine months
p285
aVcausing severe loss of agriculture output
p286
aVand pain and loss to society.
p287
aVJust a year later the Yangtze flooded,
p288
aVcausing something like 5,500 deaths.
p289
aVSo clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
p290
aVIt was associated largely with the construction industry.
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd the Chinese government responded sensibly
p293
aVand placed a ban on felling.
p294
aVA retrospective on 40 years
p295
aVshows that if we had accounted for these costs \u2014
p296
aVthe cost of loss of topsoil,
p297
aVthe cost of loss of waterways,
p298
aVthe lost productivity, the loss to local communities
p299
aVas a result of all these factors,
p300
aVdesertification and so on \u2014
p301
aVthose costs are almost twice as much
p302
aVas the market price of timber.
p303
aVSo in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace
p304
aVought to have been three-times what it was
p305
aVhad it reflected the true pain and the costs
p306
aVto the society within China.
p307
aVOf course, after the event one can be wise.
p308
aa(lp309
VThe way to do this is to do it on a company basis,
p310
aVto take leadership forward,
p311
aVand to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,
p312
aVand to disclose these answers.
p313
aVSomeone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,
p314
aVis it Unilever or is it P&G
p315
aVwhen it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"
p316
aVAnd I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,
p317
aVgood though they are and professional though they are,
p318
aVdo not calculate or disclose their externalities.
p319
aa(lp320
VBut if we look at companies like PUMA \u2014
p321
aVJochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,
p322
aVonce challenged me at a function,
p323
aVsaying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.
p324
aVWell I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.
p325
aVHe's basically worked the cost to PUMA.
p326
aVPUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,
p327
aV300 million dollars of profits,
p328
aV200 million dollars after tax,
p329
aV94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.
p330
aVNow that's not a happy situation for them,
p331
aVbut they have the confidence and the courage
p332
aVto come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.
p333
aVWe are measuring it because we know
p334
aVthat you cannot manage what you do not measure."
p335
aa(lp336
VThat's an example, I think, for us to look at
p337
aVand for us to draw comfort from.
p338
aVIf more companies did this,
p339
aVand if more sectors engaged this as sectors,
p340
aVyou could have analysts, business analysts,
p341
aVand you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs
p342
aVactually look and compare the social performance of companies.
p343
aVToday we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.
p344
aVThis can be done.
p345
aVAnd I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
p346
aVhas already set up a coalition to do this,
p347
aVan international coalition.
p348
aa(lp349
VThe other favorite, if you like, solution for me
p350
aVis the creation of green carbon markets.
p351
aVAnd by the way, these are my favorites \u2014
p352
aVexternalities calculation and green carbon markets.
p353
aVTEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions
p354
aVincluding protected area evaluation
p355
aVand payments for ecosystem services
p356
aVand eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.
p357
aVWhat's green carbon?
p358
aVToday what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.
p359
aVIt's about energy emissions.
p360
aVThe European Union ETS is the main marketplace.
p361
aVIt's not doing too well. We've over-issued.
p362
aVA bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,
p363
aVyou get what you see, declining prices.
p364
aVBut that's all about energy and industry.
p365
aa(lp366
VBut what we're missing is also some other emissions
p367
aVlike black carbon, that is soot.
p368
aVWhat we're also missing is blue carbon,
p369
aVwhich, by the way, is the largest store of carbon \u2014
p370
aVmore than 55 percent.
p371
aVThankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions
p372
aVfrom the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,
p373
aVis more or less balanced.
p374
aVIn fact, what's being absorbed
p375
aVis something like 25 percent of our emissions,
p376
aVwhich then leads to acidification
p377
aVor lower alkalinity in oceans.
p378
aVMore of that in a minute.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd finally, there's deforestation,
p381
aVand there's emission of methane
p382
aVfrom agriculture.
p383
aVGreen carbon,
p384
aVwhich is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,
p385
aVand blue carbon
p386
aVtogether comprise 25 percent of our emissions.
p387
aVWe have the means already in our hands,
p388
aVthrough a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus \u2014
p389
aVa scheme for the reduced emissions
p390
aVfrom deforestation and forest degradation.
p391
aVAnd already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each
p392
aVtowards Indonesia and Brazil
p393
aVto implement this Red Plus scheme.
p394
aVSo we actually have some movement forward.
p395
aVBut the thing is to do a lot more of that.
p396
aa(lp397
VWill this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?
p398
aVWell I'm afraid not.
p399
aVThere is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.
p400
aVAs you can see,
p401
aVthey cut across the entire globe
p402
aVall the way from Micronesia
p403
aVacross Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar
p404
aVand to the West of the Caribbean.
p405
aVThese red dots, these red areas,
p406
aVbasically provide the food and livelihood
p407
aVfor more than half a billion people.
p408
aVSo that's almost an eighth of society.
p409
aVAnd the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost \u2014
p410
aVand scientists tell us
p411
aVthat any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million
p412
aVis too dangerous for the survival of these reefs \u2014
p413
aVwe are not only risking the extinction
p414
aVof the entire coral species, the warm water corals,
p415
aVwe're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,
p416
aVbut we are risking the very lives and livelihoods
p417
aVof more than 500 million people
p418
aVwho live in the developing world in poor countries.
p419
aa(lp420
VSo in selecting targets of 450 parts per million
p421
aVand selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,
p422
aVwhat we have done is we've made an ethical choice.
p423
aVWe've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society
p424
aVto not have coral reefs.
p425
aVWell what I will say to you in parting
p426
aVis that we may have done that.
p427
aVLet's think about it and what it means,
p428
aVbut please, let's not do more of that.
p429
aVBecause mother nature only has that much
p430
aVin ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.
p431
aVI don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.
p432
aa(lp433
VThank you.
