VWell, I'm an ocean chemist.
p4
aVI look at the chemistry of the ocean today.
p5
aVI look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past.
p6
aVThe way I look back in the past
p7
aVis by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals.
p8
aVYou can see an image of one of these corals behind me.
p9
aVIt was collected from close to Antarctica, thousands of meters below the sea,
p10
aVso, very different than the kinds of corals
p11
aVyou may have been lucky enough to see if you've had a tropical holiday.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo I'm hoping that this talk will give you
p14
aVa four-dimensional view of the ocean.
p15
aVTwo dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image
p16
aVof the sea surface temperature.
p17
aVThis was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.
p18
aVThe overall features are extremely easy to understand.
p19
aVThe equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight.
p20
aVThe polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight.
p21
aVAnd that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica
p22
aVand up in the Northern Hemisphere.
p23
aVIf you plunge deep into the sea, or even put your toes in the sea,
p24
aVyou know it gets colder as you go down,
p25
aVand that's mostly because the deep waters that fill the abyss of the ocean
p26
aVcome from the cold polar regions where the waters are dense.
p27
aa(lp28
VIf we travel back in time 20,000 years ago,
p29
aVthe earth looked very much different.
p30
aVAnd I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences
p31
aVyou would have seen if you went back that long.
p32
aVThe icecaps were much bigger.
p33
aVThey covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean.
p34
aVSea level was 120 meters lower.
p35
aVCarbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today.
p36
aVSo the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall,
p37
aVand much, much colder in the polar regions.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhat I'm trying to understand,
p40
aVand what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand,
p41
aVis how we moved from that cold climate condition
p42
aVto the warm climate condition that we enjoy today.
p43
aVWe know from ice core research
p44
aVthat the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions
p45
aVwasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation.
p46
aVAnd we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice,
p47
aVyou find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg.
p48
aVYou can see those blue-white layers.
p49
aVGases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 \u2014
p50
aVthat's why we know CO2 was lower in the past \u2014
p51
aVand the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature
p52
aVin the polar regions.
p53
aVAnd if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,
p54
aVyou see that temperature increased.
p55
aVIt didn't increase smoothly.
p56
aVSometimes it increased very rapidly,
p57
aVthen there was a plateau,
p58
aVthen it increased rapidly.
p59
aVIt was different in the two polar regions,
p60
aVand CO2 also increased in jumps.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this.
p63
aVThe ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,
p64
aVabout 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.
p65
aVIt also acts to transport heat across the equator,
p66
aVand the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea,
p69
aVwe really need to get down there,
p70
aVsee what's there
p71
aVand start to explore.
p72
aVThis is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount
p73
aVabout a kilometer deep in international waters
p74
aVin the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.
p75
aVYou're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor,
p76
aValong with my research team.
p77
aVYou're probably seeing new species.
p78
aVWe don't know.
p79
aVYou'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy.
p80
aVYou can see beautiful bubblegum corals.
p81
aVThere are brittle stars growing on these corals.
p82
aVThose are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals.
p83
aVThere are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate
p84
aVgrowing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain,
p85
aVand the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals,
p86
aVand we're going to talk a little more about those
p87
aVas we travel back in time.
p88
aa(lp89
VTo do that, we need to charter a research boat.
p90
aVThis is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel
p91
aVmoored up in Tenerife.
p92
aVLooks beautiful, right?
p93
aVGreat, if you're not a great mariner.
p94
aVSometimes it looks a little more like this.
p95
aVThis is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples.
p96
aVEveryone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick,
p97
aVso it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo we've got to become a really good mapper to do this.
p100
aVYou don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere.
p101
aVIt is global and it is deep,
p102
aVbut we need to really find the right places.
p103
aVWe just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage
p104
aVfrom last year.
p105
aVThis was a seven-week cruise,
p106
aVand this is us, having made our own maps
p107
aVof about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks,
p108
aVbut that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor.
p109
aVWe're traveling from west to east,
p110
aVover part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map,
p111
aVbut actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest.
p112
aVSo with the maps that we make on board,
p113
aVwe get about 100-meter resolution,
p114
aVenough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment,
p115
aVbut not enough to see very much.
p116
aVTo do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles
p117
aVabout five meters off the seafloor.
p118
aVAnd if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution
p119
aVdown thousands of meters.
p120
aVHere is a remotely-operated vehicle,
p121
aVa research-grade vehicle.
p122
aVYou can see an array of big lights on the top.
p123
aVThere are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms,
p124
aVand lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.
p125
aa(lp126
VHere we are on our first dive of this particular cruise,
p127
aVplunging down into the ocean.
p128
aVWe go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles
p129
aVare not affected by any other ships.
p130
aVAnd we go down,
p131
aVand these are the kinds of things you see.
p132
aVThese are deep sea sponges, meter scale.
p133
aVThis is a swimming holothurian \u2014 it's a small sea slug, basically.
p134
aVThis is slowed down.
p135
aVMost of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up,
p136
aVbecause all of this takes a lot of time.
p137
aVThis is a beautiful holothurian as well.
p138
aVAnd this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.
p139
aVI've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.
p140
aVThis was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy,
p141
aVand suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.
p142
aVIt's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.
p143
aVThis wasn't what we were looking for.
p144
aVWe were looking for corals, deep sea corals.
p145
aVYou're going to see a picture of one in a moment.
p146
aVIt's small, about five centimeters high.
p147
aVIt's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there,
p148
aVmoving in the ocean currents.
p149
aVAn organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years.
p150
aVAnd as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean.
p151
aVAnd the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals,
p152
aVdepends on the temperature; it depends on the pH,
p153
aVit depends on the nutrients.
p154
aVAnd if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton,
p155
aVwe can then go back, collect fossil specimens,
p156
aVand reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past.
p157
aVAnd here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system,
p158
aVand we put it into a sampling container.
p159
aVWe can do this very carefully, I should add.
p160
aa(lp161
VSome of these organisms live even longer.
p162
aVThis is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague,
p163
aVBrendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii.
p164
aVFour thousand years is a long time.
p165
aVIf you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up,
p166
aVthis is about 100 microns across.
p167
aVAnd Brendan took some analyses across this coral \u2014
p168
aVyou can see the marks \u2014
p169
aVand he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands,
p170
aVso even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,
p171
aVcorals can record seasonal changes,
p172
aVwhich is pretty spectacular.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum.
p175
aVSo what do we do?
p176
aVWe go in for these fossil specimens.
p177
aVThis is what makes me really unpopular with my research team.
p178
aVSo going along,
p179
aVthere's giant sharks everywhere,
p180
aVthere are pyrosomes, there are swimming holothurians,
p181
aVthere's giant sponges,
p182
aVbut I make everyone go down to these dead fossil areas
p183
aVand spend ages kind of shoveling around on the seafloor.
p184
aVAnd we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out.
p185
aVBut each one of these is a different age,
p186
aVand if we can find out how old they are
p187
aVand then we can measure those chemical signals,
p188
aVthis helps us to find out
p189
aVwhat's been going on in the ocean in the past.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo on the left-hand image here,
p192
aVI've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully
p193
aVand taken an optical image.
p194
aVOn the right-hand side,
p195
aVwe've taken that same piece of coral, put it in a nuclear reactor,
p196
aVinduced fission,
p197
aVand every time there's some decay,
p198
aVyou can see that marked out in the coral,
p199
aVso we can see the uranium distribution.
p200
aVWhy are we doing this?
p201
aVUranium is a very poorly regarded element,
p202
aVbut I love it.
p203
aVThe decay helps us find out about the rates and dates
p204
aVof what's going on in the ocean.
p205
aVAnd if you remember from the beginning,
p206
aVthat's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate.
p207
aVSo we use a laser to analyze uranium
p208
aVand one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals,
p209
aVand that tells us exactly how old the fossils are.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean
p212
aVI'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals
p213
aVto get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks.
p214
aVYou can see the density of the surface water
p215
aVin this animation by Ryan Abernathey.
p216
aVIt's just one year of data,
p217
aVbut you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is.
p218
aVThe intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage,
p219
aVwhich is shown by the box,
p220
aVis really one of the strongest currents in the world
p221
aVcoming through here, flowing from west to east.
p222
aVIt's very turbulently mixed,
p223
aVbecause it's moving over those great big undersea mountains,
p224
aVand this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out.
p225
aVAnd essentially, the oceans are breathing through the Southern Ocean.
p226
aVWe've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage,
p227
aVand we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating:
p228
aVthe corals migrated from south to north
p229
aVduring this transition from the glacial to the interglacial.
p230
aVWe don't really know why,
p231
aVbut we think it's something to do with the food source
p232
aVand maybe the oxygen in the water.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo here we are.
p235
aVI'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate
p236
aVfrom those corals in the Southern Ocean.
p237
aVWe went up and down sea mountains. We collected little fossil corals.
p238
aVThis is my illustration of that.
p239
aVWe think back in the glacial,
p240
aVfrom the analysis we've made in the corals,
p241
aVthat the deep part of the Southern Ocean was very rich in carbon,
p242
aVand there was a low-density layer sitting on top.
p243
aVThat stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean.
p244
aVWe then found corals that are of an intermediate age,
p245
aVand they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition.
p246
aVThat allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean.
p247
aVAnd then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day,
p248
aVor indeed if we go down there today anyway
p249
aVand measure the chemistry of the corals,
p250
aVwe see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out.
p251
aVSo this is the way we can use fossil corals
p252
aVto help us learn about the environment.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo I want to leave you with this last slide.
p255
aVIt's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you.
p256
aVThis is a spectacular coral garden.
p257
aVWe didn't even expect to find things this beautiful.
p258
aVIt's thousands of meters deep.
p259
aVThere are new species.
p260
aVIt's just a beautiful place.
p261
aVThere are fossils in amongst,
p262
aVand now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals
p263
aVthat are down there.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean
p266
aVor sail over the ocean,
p267
aVjust think \u2014 there are massive sea mountains down there
p268
aVthat nobody's ever seen before,
p269
aVand there are beautiful corals.
p270
