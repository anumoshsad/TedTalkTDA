VI feel so fortunate that my first job
p4
aVwas working at the Museum of Modern Art
p5
aVon a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.
p6
aVI learned so much from her.
p7
aVAfter the curator Robert Storr
p8
aVselected all the paintings
p9
aVfrom her lifetime body of work,
p10
aVI loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.
p11
aVThere were some motifs and elements
p12
aVthat would come up again later in her life.
p13
aVI remember asking her
p14
aVwhat she thought of those early works.
p15
aVIf you didn't know they were hers,
p16
aVyou might not have been able to guess.
p17
aVShe told me that a few didn't quite meet
p18
aVher own mark for what she wanted them to be.
p19
aVOne of the works, in fact,
p20
aVso didn't meet her mark,
p21
aVshe had set it out in the trash in her studio,
p22
aVand her neighbor had taken it
p23
aVbecause she saw its value.
p24
aa(lp25
VIn that moment, my view of success
p26
aVand creativity changed.
p27
aVI realized that success is a moment,
p28
aVbut what we're always celebrating
p29
aVis creativity and mastery.
p30
aVBut this is the thing: What gets us to convert success
p31
aVinto mastery?
p32
aVThis is a question I've long asked myself.
p33
aVI think it comes when we start to value
p34
aVthe gift of a near win.
p35
aa(lp36
VI started to understand this when I went
p37
aVon one cold May day
p38
aVto watch a set of varsity archers,
p39
aVall women as fate would have it,
p40
aVat the northern tip of Manhattan
p41
aVat Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.
p42
aVI wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,
p43
aVthe idea that in order to actually hit your target,
p44
aVyou have to aim at something slightly skew from it.
p45
aVI stood and watched as the coach
p46
aVdrove up these women in this gray van,
p47
aVand they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.
p48
aVOne held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand
p49
aVand arrows in the left with yellow fletching.
p50
aVAnd they passed me and smiled,
p51
aVbut they sized me up as they
p52
aVmade their way to the turf,
p53
aVand spoke to each other not with words
p54
aVbut with numbers, degrees, I thought,
p55
aVpositions for how they might plan
p56
aVto hit their target.
p57
aVI stood behind one archer as her coach
p58
aVstood in between us to maybe assess
p59
aVwho might need support, and watched her,
p60
aVand I didn't understand how even one
p61
aVwas going to hit the ten ring.
p62
aVThe ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,
p63
aVit looks as small as a matchstick tip
p64
aVheld out at arm's length.
p65
aVAnd this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight
p66
aVon each shot.
p67
aVShe first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,
p68
aVand then two tens,
p69
aVand then the next arrow
p70
aVdidn't even hit the target.
p71
aVAnd I saw that gave her more tenacity,
p72
aVand she went after it again and again.
p73
aVFor three hours this went on.
p74
aVAt the end of the practice, one of the archers
p75
aVwas so taxed that she lied out on the ground
p76
aVjust star-fished,
p77
aVher head looking up at the sky,
p78
aVtrying to find what T.S. Eliot might call
p79
aVthat still point of the turning world.
p80
aa(lp81
VIt's so rare in American culture,
p82
aVthere's so little that's vocational about it anymore,
p83
aVto look at what doggedness looks like
p84
aVwith this level of exactitude,
p85
aVwhat it means to align your body posture
p86
aVfor three hours in order to hit a target,
p87
aVpursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.
p88
aVBut I stayed because I realized I was witnessing
p89
aVwhat's so rare to glimpse,
p90
aVthat difference between success and mastery.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo success is hitting that ten ring,
p93
aVbut mastery is knowing that it means nothing
p94
aVif you can't do it again and again.
p95
aVMastery is not just the same as excellence, though.
p96
aVIt's not the same as success,
p97
aVwhich I see as an event,
p98
aVa moment in time,
p99
aVand a label that the world confers upon you.
p100
aVMastery is not a commitment to a goal
p101
aVbut to a constant pursuit.
p102
aVWhat gets us to do this,
p103
aVwhat get us to forward thrust more
p104
aVis to value the near win.
p105
aVHow many times have we designated something
p106
aVa classic, a masterpiece even,
p107
aVwhile its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,
p108
aVriddled with difficulties and flaws,
p109
aVin other words, a near win?
p110
aVElizabeth Murray surprised me
p111
aVwith her admission about her earlier paintings.
p112
aVPainter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete
p113
aVthat he would deliberately leave them aside
p114
aVwith the intention of picking them back up again,
p115
aVbut at the end of his life,
p116
aVthe result was that he had only signed
p117
aV10 percent of his paintings.
p118
aVHis favorite novel was "The [Unknown] Masterpiece" by Honoré de Balzac,
p119
aVand he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.
p120
aVFranz Kafka saw incompletion
p121
aVwhen others would find only works to praise,
p122
aVso much so that he wanted all of his diaries,
p123
aVmanuscripts, letters and even sketches
p124
aVburned upon his death.
p125
aVHis friend refused to honor the request,
p126
aVand because of that, we now have all the works
p127
aVwe now do by Kafka:
p128
aV"America," "The Trial" and "The Castle,"
p129
aVa work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe pursuit of mastery, in other words,
p132
aVis an ever-onward almost.
p133
aV"Lord, grant that I desire
p134
aVmore than I can accomplish,"
p135
aVMichelangelo implored,
p136
aVas if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,
p137
aVand he himself was that Adam
p138
aVwith his finger outstretched
p139
aVand not quite touching that God's hand.
p140
aa(lp141
VMastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.
p142
aVIt's in constantly wanting to close that gap
p143
aVbetween where you are and where you want to be.
p144
aVMastery is about sacrificing for your craft
p145
aVand not for the sake of crafting your career.
p146
aVHow many inventors and untold entrepreneurs
p147
aVlive out this phenomenon?
p148
aVWe see it even in the life
p149
aVof the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,
p150
aVwho tells me that his triumphs
p151
aVare not merely the result
p152
aVof a grand achievement,
p153
aVbut of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.
p154
aa(lp155
VWe thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.
p156
aVIt's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,
p157
aVwho said that his favorite song out of his repertoire
p158
aVwas always the next one,
p159
aValways the one he had yet to compose.
p160
aVPart of the reason that the near win
p161
aVis inbuilt to mastery
p162
aVis because the greater our proficiency,
p163
aVthe more clearly we might see
p164
aVthat we don't know all that we thought we did.
p165
aVIt's called the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect.
p166
aVThe Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin
p167
aVwhen they asked him,
p168
aV"What do you think increases with knowledge?"
p169
aVand he said, "You learn how little you know."
p170
aa(lp171
VSuccess motivates us, but a near win
p172
aVcan propel us in an ongoing quest.
p173
aVOne of the most vivid examples of this comes
p174
aVwhen we look at the difference
p175
aVbetween Olympic silver medalists
p176
aVand bronze medalists after a competition.
p177
aVThomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell
p178
aVstudied this difference and found
p179
aVthat the frustration silver medalists feel
p180
aVcompared to bronze, who are typically a bit
p181
aVmore happy to have just not received fourth place
p182
aVand not medaled at all,
p183
aVgives silver medalists a focus
p184
aVon follow-up competition.
p185
aVWe see it even in the gambling industry
p186
aVthat once picked up on this phenomenon
p187
aVof the near win
p188
aVand created these scratch-off tickets
p189
aVthat had a higher than average rate of near wins
p190
aVand so compelled people to buy more tickets
p191
aVthat they were called heart-stoppers,
p192
aVand were set on a gambling industry set of abuses
p193
aVin Britain in the 1970s.
p194
aVThe reason the near win has a propulsion
p195
aVis because it changes our view of the landscape
p196
aVand puts our goals, which we tend to put
p197
aVat a distance, into more proximate vicinity
p198
aVto where we stand.
p199
aVIf I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week,
p200
aVyou might describe it in more general terms.
p201
aVBut if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow,
p202
aVyou might describe it with granular, practical clarity.
p203
aVAnd this is what a near win does.
p204
aVIt gets us to focus on what, right now,
p205
aVwe plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.
p206
aVIt's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984
p207
aVmissed taking the gold in the heptathlon
p208
aVby one third of a second,
p209
aVand her husband predicted that would give her
p210
aVthe tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.
p211
aVIn 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon
p212
aVand set a record of 7,291 points,
p213
aVa score that no athlete has come very close to since.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe thrive not when we've done it all,
p216
aVbut when we still have more to do.
p217
aVI stand here thinking and wondering
p218
aVabout all the different ways
p219
aVthat we might even manufacture a near win
p220
aVin this room,
p221
aVhow your lives might play this out,
p222
aVbecause I think on some gut level we do know this.
p223
aVWe know that we thrive when we stay
p224
aVat our own leading edge,
p225
aVand it's why the deliberate incomplete
p226
aVis inbuilt into creation myths.
p227
aVIn Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women
p228
aVwould deliberately put an imperfection
p229
aVin textiles and ceramics.
p230
aVIt's what's called a spirit line,
p231
aVa deliberate flaw in the pattern
p232
aVto give the weaver or maker a way out,
p233
aVbut also a reason to continue making work.
p234
aVMasters are not experts because they take
p235
aVa subject to its conceptual end.
p236
aVThey're masters because they realize
p237
aVthat there isn't one.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow it occurred to me, as I thought about this,
p240
aVwhy the archery coach
p241
aVtold me at the end of that practice,
p242
aVout of earshot of his archers,
p243
aVthat he and his colleagues never feel
p244
aVthey can do enough for their team,
p245
aVnever feel there are enough visualization techniques
p246
aVand posture drills to help them overcome
p247
aVthose constant near wins.
p248
aVIt didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,
p249
aVbut just a way to let me know,
p250
aVa kind of tender admission,
p251
aVto remind me that he knew he was giving himself over
p252
aVto a voracious, unfinished path
p253
aVthat always required more.
p254
aa(lp255
VWe build out of the unfinished idea,
p256
aVeven if that idea is our former self.
p257
aVThis is the dynamic of mastery.
p258
aVComing close to what you thought you wanted
p259
aVcan help you attain more than you ever dreamed
p260
aVyou could.
p261
aVIt's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray
p262
aVwas thinking when I saw her smiling
p263
aVat those early paintings one day
p264
aVin the galleries.
p265
aVEven if we created utopias, I believe
p266
aVwe would still have the incomplete.
p267
aVCompletion is a goal,
p268
aVbut we hope it is never the end.
