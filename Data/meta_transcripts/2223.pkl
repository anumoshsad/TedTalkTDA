VWhen I wrote my memoir,
p4
aVthe publishers were really confused.
p5
aVWas it about me as a child refugee,
p6
aVor as a woman who set up a high-tech software company back in the 1960s,
p7
aVone that went public
p8
aVand eventually employed over 8,500 people?
p9
aVOr was it as a mother of an autistic child?
p10
aVOr as a philanthropist that's now given away serious money?
p11
aVWell, it turns out, I'm all of these.
p12
aVSo let me tell you my story.
p13
aa(lp14
VAll that I am stems from when I got onto a train in Vienna,
p15
aVpart of the Kindertransport that saved nearly 10,000 Jewish children
p16
aVfrom Nazi Europe.
p17
aVI was five years old, clutching the hand of my nine-year-old sister
p18
aVand had very little idea as to  what was going on.
p19
aV"What is England and  why am I going there?"
p20
aVI'm only alive because so long ago,  I was helped by generous strangers.
p21
aVI was lucky, and doubly lucky to be later reunited
p22
aVwith my birth parents.
p23
aVBut, sadly, I never bonded  with them again.
p24
aVBut I've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day
p25
aVwhen my mother put me on the train
p26
aVthan I would ever have dreamed possible.
p27
aVAnd I love England, my adopted country,
p28
aVwith a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel.
p29
aVI decided to make mine a life that was worth saving.
p30
aVAnd then, I just got on with it.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VLet me take you back to the early 1960s.
p34
aVTo get past the gender issues of the time,
p35
aVI set up my own software house at one of the first such startups in Britain.
p36
aVBut it was also a company of women, a company for women,
p37
aVan early social business.
p38
aVAnd people laughed at the very idea because software, at that time,
p39
aVwas given away free with hardware.
p40
aVNobody would buy software, certainly not from a woman.
p41
aVAlthough women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees,
p42
aVthere was a glass ceiling to our progress.
p43
aVAnd I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,
p44
aVand I wanted opportunities for women.
p45
aa(lp46
VI recruited professionally qualified women who'd left the industry on marriage,
p47
aVor when their first child was expected
p48
aVand structured them into a home-working organization.
p49
aVWe pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce
p50
aVafter a career break.
p51
aVWe pioneered all sorts of new, flexible work methods:
p52
aVjob shares, profit-sharing,  and eventually, co-ownership
p53
aVwhen I took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff
p54
aVat no cost to anyone but me.
p55
aVFor years, I was the first woman this, or the only woman that.
p56
aVAnd in those days, I couldn't work on the stock exchange,
p57
aVI couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.
p58
aVIndeed, I couldn't open a bank account without my husband's permission.
p59
aVMy generation of women fought the battles for the right to work
p60
aVand the right for equal pay.
p61
aa(lp62
VNobody really expected much  from people at work or in society
p63
aVbecause all the expectations then
p64
aVwere about home and  family responsibilities.
p65
aVAnd I couldn't really face that,
p66
aVso I started to challenge the conventions of the time,
p67
aVeven to the extent of changing my name from "Stephanie" to "Steve"
p68
aVin my business development letters,
p69
aVso as to get through the door before anyone realized
p70
aVthat he was a she.
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VMy company, called Freelance Programmers, and that's precisely what it was,
p74
aVcouldn't have started smaller:  on the dining room table,
p75
aVand financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today's terms,
p76
aVand financed by my labor and  by borrowing against the house.
p77
aVMy interests were scientific,  the market was commercial \u2014
p78
aVthings such as payroll, which I found rather boring.
p79
aVSo I had to compromise with  operational research work,
p80
aVwhich had the intellectual challenge  that interested me
p81
aVand the commercial value  that was valued by the clients:
p82
aVthings like scheduling freight trains,
p83
aVtime-tabling buses, stock control, lots and lots of stock control.
p84
aVAnd eventually, the work came in.
p85
aVWe disguised the domestic and part-time nature of the staff
p86
aVby offering fixed prices, one of the very first to do so.
p87
aVAnd who would have guessed that the programming
p88
aVof the black box flight recorder  of Supersonic Concord
p89
aVwould have been done by a bunch  of women working in their own homes.
p90
aV(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VAll we used was a simple  "trust the staff" approach
p93
aVand a simple telephone.
p94
aVWe even used to ask job applicants,  "Do you have access to a telephone?"
p95
aa(lp96
VAn early project was to develop software standards
p97
aVon management control protocols.
p98
aVAnd software was and still is a maddeningly hard-to-control activity,
p99
aVso that was enormously valuable.
p100
aVWe used the standards ourselves,
p101
aVwe were even paid to update  them over the years,
p102
aVand eventually, they were adopted by NATO.
p103
aVOur programmers \u2014 remember, only women,
p104
aVincluding gay and transgender \u2014
p105
aVworked with pencil and paper to develop flowcharts
p106
aVdefining each task to be done.
p107
aVAnd they then wrote code,  usually machine code,
p108
aVsometimes binary code,
p109
aVwhich was then sent by mail to a data center
p110
aVto be punched onto paper tape or card
p111
aVand then re-punched,  in order to verify it.
p112
aVAll this, before it ever got near a computer.
p113
aVThat was programming in the early 1960s.
p114
aa(lp115
VIn 1975, 13 years from startup,
p116
aVequal opportunity legislation  came in in Britain
p117
aVand that made it illegal to have  our pro-female policies.
p118
aVAnd as an example of  unintended consequences,
p119
aVmy female company had to let the men in.
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VWhen I started my company of women,
p123
aVthe men said, "How interesting, because it only works because it's small."
p124
aVAnd later, as it became sizable,  they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now,
p125
aVbut of no strategic interest."
p126
aVAnd later, when it was a company valued at over three billion dollars,
p127
aVand I'd made 70 of the staff  into millionaires,
p128
aVthey sort of said, "Well done, Steve!"
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aV(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VYou can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads:
p133
aVThey're flat on top for being  patted patronizingly.
p134
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p135
aVAnd we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VLet me share with you  two secrets of success:
p139
aVSurround yourself with first-class people and people that you like;
p140
aVand choose your partner very, very carefully.
p141
aVBecause the other day when I said,  "My husband's an angel,"
p142
aVa woman complained \u2014 "You're lucky," she said,
p143
aV"mine's still alive."
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VIf success were easy,  we'd all be millionaires.
p147
aVBut in my case, it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed, crisis.
p148
aVOur late son, Giles, was an only child, a beautiful, contented baby.
p149
aVAnd then, at two and a half,
p150
aVlike a changeling in a fairy story,
p151
aVhe lost the little speech that he had
p152
aVand turned into a wild,  unmanageable toddler.
p153
aVNot the terrible twos;
p154
aVhe was profoundly autistic  and he never spoke again.
p155
aVGiles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that I set up
p156
aVto pioneer services for autism.
p157
aVAnd then there's been a groundbreaking Prior's Court school
p158
aVfor pupils with autism
p159
aVand a medical research charity, again, all for autism.
p160
aVBecause whenever I found a gap in services, I tried to help.
p161
aVI like doing new things  and making new things happen.
p162
aVAnd I've just started a three-year  think tank for autism.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems,
p165
aVI've also founded  the Oxford Internet Institute
p166
aVand other IT ventures.
p167
aVThe Oxford Internet Institute focuses not on the technology,
p168
aVbut on the social, economic, legal and ethical issues of the Internet.
p169
aa(lp170
VGiles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.
p171
aVAnd I have learned to live without him,
p172
aVand I have learned to live  without his need of me.
p173
aVPhilanthropy is all that I do now.
p174
aVI need never worry about getting lost
p175
aVbecause several charities would quickly come and find me.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VIt's one thing to have an idea  for an enterprise,
p179
aVbut as many people in this room will know,
p180
aVmaking it happen is a very difficult thing
p181
aVand it demands extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination,
p182
aVthe courage to risk family and home,
p183
aVand a 24/7 commitment  that borders on the obsessive.
p184
aVSo it's just as well that I'm a workaholic.
p185
aVI believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility.
p186
aVWork is not just something I do when I'd rather be doing something else.
p187
aa(lp188
VWe live our lives forward.
p189
aVSo what has all that taught me?
p190
aVI learned that tomorrow's  never going to be like today,
p191
aVand certainly nothing like yesterday.
p192
aVAnd that made me able to cope with change,
p193
aVindeed, eventually to welcome change,
p194
aVthough I'm told I'm still very difficult.
p195
aa(lp196
VThank you very much.
