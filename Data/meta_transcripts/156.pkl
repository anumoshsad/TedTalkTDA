VLike many of you here, I am trying to contribute
p4
aVtowards a renaissance in Africa.
p5
aVThe question of transformation in Africa
p6
aVreally is a question of leadership.
p7
aVAfrica can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
p8
aVAnd it is my contention that the manner in which
p9
aVwe educate our leaders is fundamental
p10
aVto progress on this continent.
p11
aVI want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
p12
aVWe all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
p13
aVAn American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,
p14
aVand in a period of three months she came to a conclusion
p15
aVabout the state of leadership in Africa
p16
aVthat had taken me over a decade to reach.
p17
aVTwice she was involved in surgeries
p18
aVwhere they lost power at the hospital.
p19
aVThe emergency generators did not start.
p20
aVThere was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle \u2014
p21
aVpitch black.
p22
aVThe patient's cut open, twice.
p23
aVThe first time it was a C-section.
p24
aVThankfully, baby was out \u2014 mother and child survived.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
p27
aVAnesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
p28
aVHe's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
p29
aVPitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
p30
aVAnd that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
p31
aVThey could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
p32
aVAnd it happened twice.
p33
aVAnother time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die
p34
aVbecause they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
p35
aVAnd so three months later,
p36
aVjust before she returned to the United States,
p37
aVnurses in Accra go on strike.
p38
aVAnd her recommendation is
p39
aVtake this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
p40
aVStart all over again.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow what does this have to do with leadership?
p43
aVYou see, the folks at the ministry of health,
p44
aVthe hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses \u2014
p45
aVthey are among just five percent of their peers
p46
aVwho get an education after secondary school.
p47
aVThey are the elite. They are our leaders.
p48
aVTheir decisions, their actions matter.
p49
aVAnd when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
p50
aVSo when I speak of leadership,
p51
aVI'm not talking about just political leaders.
p52
aVWe've heard a lot about that.
p53
aVI'm talking about the elite.
p54
aVThose who've been trained,
p55
aVwhose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
p56
aVThe lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,
p57
aVthe engineers, the civil servants \u2014
p58
aVthose are the leaders.
p59
aVAnd we need to train them right.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana
p62
aVoccurred when I was 16 years old.
p63
aVWe had just had a military coup,
p64
aVand soldiers were pervasive in our society.
p65
aVThey were a pervasive presence.
p66
aVAnd one day I go to the airport to meet my father,
p67
aVand as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park
p68
aVto the terminal building,
p69
aVI'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
p70
aVAnd they asked me to join a crowd of people
p71
aVthat were running up and down this embankment.
p72
aVWhy? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.
p73
aVNo sign to this effect.
p74
aa(lp75
VNow, I was 16. I was very worried about
p76
aVwhat my peers at school might think
p77
aVif they saw me running up and down this hill.
p78
aVI was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
p79
aVAnd so I started to argue with these men.
p80
aVIt was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
p81
aVI got lucky.
p82
aVA Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
p83
aVBecause of his uniform they speak to him differently,
p84
aVand they explain to him that they're just following orders.
p85
aVSo he takes their radio, talks to their boss,
p86
aVand gets us all released.
p87
aVWhat lessons would you take from an experience like this?
p88
aVSeveral, for me.
p89
aVLeadership matters. Those men are following
p90
aVthe orders of a superior officer.
p91
aVI learned something about courage.
p92
aVIt was important not to look at those guns.
p93
aVAnd I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship
p98
aVto go to Swarthmore College for my education.
p99
aVIt was a breath of fresh air.
p100
aVYou know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information
p101
aVand repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
p102
aVThey wanted us to think critically.
p103
aVThey wanted us to be analytical.
p104
aVThey wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
p105
aVIn my economics classes I got high marks
p106
aVfor my understanding of basic economics.
p107
aVBut I learned something more profound than that,
p108
aVwhich is that the leaders \u2014 the managers of Ghana's economy \u2014
p109
aVwere making breathtakingly bad decisions
p110
aVthat had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
p111
aVAnd so here was this lesson again \u2014 leadership matters.
p112
aVIt matters a great deal.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
p115
aVI had an inkling,
p116
aVbut I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace
p117
aVand I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
p118
aVAnd I was part of this team \u2014 this thinking, learning team
p119
aVwhose job it was to design and implement new software
p120
aVthat created value in the world.
p121
aVAnd it was brilliant to be part of this team.
p122
aVIt was brilliant.
p123
aVAnd I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,
p124
aVthis transformation \u2014
p125
aVthe ability to confront problems, complex problems,
p126
aVand to design solutions to those problems.
p127
aVThe ability to create is the most empowering thing
p128
aVthat can happen to an individual.
p129
aVAnd I was part of that.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company
p132
aVgrew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
p133
aVAnd by the way, it's continued to.
p134
aVThe gap has widened since I left.
p135
aVNow, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
p136
aVI mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,
p137
aVpersistent, creative, empowered.
p138
aVBut there were also some external factors:
p139
aVfree markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
p140
aVThese things were provided by institutions
p141
aVrun by the people that I call leaders.
p142
aVAnd those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
p143
aVSomebody trained them to do the work that they do.
p144
aVNow, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
p145
aVI became a parent.
p146
aVAnd for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
p147
aVBecause I realized that the state of the African continent
p148
aVwould matter to my children and their children.
p149
aVThat the state of the world \u2014 the state of the world
p150
aVdepends on what's happening to Africa,
p151
aVas far as my kids would be concerned.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd at this time, when I was going through
p154
aVwhat I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"
p155
aVAfrica was a mess.
p156
aVSomalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
p157
aVRwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
p158
aVAnd it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,
p159
aVand I needed to be back helping.
p160
aVI couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids
p161
aVin an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
p162
aVThis was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
p163
aVSo I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did
p164
aVwas to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people
p165
aVand really try to understand what the real issues were.
p166
aVAnd three things kept coming up for every problem:
p167
aVcorruption, weak institutions
p168
aVand the people who run them \u2014 the leaders.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, I was a little scared
p171
aVbecause when you see those three problems,
p172
aVthey seem really hard to deal with.
p173
aVAnd they might say, "Look, don't even try."
p174
aVBut, for me, I asked the question,
p175
aV"Well, where are these leaders coming from?
p176
aVWhat is it about Ghana that produces leaders
p177
aVthat are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
p178
aVSo I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
p179
aVAnd it was the same \u2014 learning by rote \u2014
p180
aVfrom primary school through graduate school.
p181
aVVery little emphasis on ethics,
p182
aVand the typical graduate
p183
aVfrom a university in Ghana has a stronger sense
p184
aVof entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
p185
aVThis is wrong.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo I decided to engage this particular problem.
p188
aVBecause it seems to me that every society, every society,
p189
aVmust be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
p190
aVAnd Ghana was not paying enough attention.
p191
aVAnd this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
p192
aVSo this is what I'm doing now.
p193
aVI'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
p194
aVI wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
p195
aVI think it would make a huge difference.
p196
aVAnd what Ashesi University is trying to do
p197
aVis to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
p198
aVWe're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,
p199
aVwho have the ability to confront the complex problems,
p200
aVask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.
p201
aa(lp202
VI'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,"
p203
aVbut we must believe that these kids are smart.
p204
aVThat if we involve them in their education,
p205
aVif we have them discuss the real issues that they confront \u2014
p206
aVthat our whole society confronts \u2014
p207
aVand if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,
p208
aVthat magic will happen.
p209
aVNow, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
p210
aVAnd a month into it, I come to the office,
p211
aVand I have this email from one of our students.
p212
aVAnd it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
p213
aVAnd he signs off, "Thank you."
p214
aVIt's such a simple statement.
p215
aVBut I was moved almost to tears
p216
aVbecause I understood what was happening to this young man.
p217
aVAnd it is an awesome thing to be a part
p218
aVof empowering someone in this way.
p219
aVI am thinking now.
p220
aa(lp221
VThis year we challenged our students
p222
aVto craft an honor code themselves.
p223
aVThere's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
p224
aVover whether they should have an honor code,
p225
aVand if so, what it should look like.
p226
aVOne of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
p227
aVCan we create a perfect society?
p228
aVHer understanding that a student-crafted honor code
p229
aVconstitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
p230
aVNow, we cannot achieve perfection,
p231
aVbut if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
p232
aVI don't know ultimately what they will do.
p233
aVI don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
p234
aVBut the conversation they're having now \u2014
p235
aVabout what their good society should look like,
p236
aVwhat their excellent society should look like,
p237
aVis a really good thing.
p238
aa(lp239
VAm I out of time? OK.
p240
aVNow, I just wanted to leave that slide up
p241
aVbecause it's important that we think about it.
p242
aVI'm very excited about the fact
p243
aVthat every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
p244
aVThat for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
p245
aVThese young future leaders are beginning to understand
p246
aVthe real business of leadership,
p247
aVthe real privilege of leadership,
p248
aVwhich is after all to serve humanity.
p249
aVI am even more thrilled by the fact that least year
p250
aVour student body elected a woman
p251
aVto be the head of Student Government.
p252
aVIt's the first time in the history of Ghana
p253
aVthat a woman has been elected head of Student Government
p254
aVat any university.
p255
aVIt says a lot about her.
p256
aVIt says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
p257
aVIt says a lot about her peers who elected her.
p258
aVShe won with 75 percent of the vote.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd it gives me a lot of hope.
p261
aVIt turns out that corporate West Africa
p262
aValso appreciates what's happening with our students.
p263
aVWe've graduated two classes of students to date.
p264
aVAnd every single one of them has been placed.
p265
aVAnd we're getting great reports back
p266
aVfrom corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,
p267
aVand the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
p268
aVYou know, that passion for what they're doing.
p269
aVThe persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,
p270
aVtheir ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
p271
aVThis is good because
p272
aVover the past five years, there have been times
p273
aVwhen I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd it's just wonderful to see these glimmers
p276
aVof the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
p277
aVI think that the current and future leaders of Africa
p278
aVhave an incredible opportunity
p279
aVto drive a major renaissance on the continent.
p280
aVIt's an incredible opportunity.
p281
aVThere aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
p282
aVI believe that Africa has reached an inflection point
p283
aVwith a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
p284
aVWe have reached a moment from which can emerge
p285
aVa great society within one generation.
p286
aVIt will depend on inspired leadership.
p287
aVAnd it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders
p288
aVwill make all the difference.
p289
aVThank you, and God bless.
