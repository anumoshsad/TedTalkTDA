VSo, I thought a lot about the first word I'd say today,
p4
aVand I decided to say "Colombia."
p5
aVAnd the reason, I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia,
p6
aVbut Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil.
p7
aVIt's a beautiful country
p8
aVwith extraordinary people, like me and others \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p9
aVand it's populated with incredible fauna, flora.
p10
aVIt's got water; it's got everything to be the perfect place.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut we have a few problems.
p13
aVYou may have heard of some of them.
p14
aVWe have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world.
p15
aVIt's been around for over 50 years,
p16
aVwhich means that in my lifetime,
p17
aVI have never lived one day  of peace in my country.
p18
aVThis guerrilla \u2014 and the main group is the FARC guerrillas,
p19
aVRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \u2014
p20
aVthey have financed their war by kidnapping, by extortion,
p21
aVby getting into the drug trade, by illegal mining.
p22
aVThere has been terrorism. There have been random bombs.
p23
aVSo it's not good. It's not really good.
p24
aVAnd if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years,
p25
aVwe have had more than 5.7 million displaced population.
p26
aVIt's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world,
p27
aVand this conflict has cost over 220,000 lives.
p28
aVSo it's a little bit like the Bolívar wars again.
p29
aVIt's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily.
p30
aa(lp31
VWe are now in the middle of peace talks,
p32
aVand we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully,
p33
aVand as part of that,
p34
aVwe decided to try something completely lateral and different:
p35
aVChristmas lights.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo Christmas lights, and you're saying,
p38
aVwhat the hell is this guy going to talk about?
p39
aVI am going to talk about gigantic trees
p40
aVthat we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle
p41
aVcovered with Christmas lights.
p42
aVThese trees helped us  demobilize 331 guerrillas,
p43
aVroughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time.
p44
aVThese trees were lit up at night,
p45
aVand they had a sign beside them
p46
aVthat said, "If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home.
p47
aVDemobilize.
p48
aVAt Christmas, everything is possible."
p49
aa(lp50
VSo how do we know these trees worked?
p51
aVWell, we got 331, which is okay,
p52
aVbut we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them,
p53
aVbut we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them,
p54
aVand we know this
p55
aVbecause we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo let me take you back four years before the trees.
p58
aVFour years before the trees, we were approached by the government
p59
aVto help them come up with a communications strategy
p60
aVto get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.
p61
aVThe government had a military strategy,
p62
aVit had a legal strategy,
p63
aVit had a political strategy, but it said,
p64
aV"We don't really have a communications strategy,
p65
aVand it probably would be a good thing to have,"
p66
aVso we decided to immediately jump into this,
p67
aVbecause it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict
p68
aVwith the things that we do, with the tools that we have.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut we didn't know very much about it.
p71
aVWe didn't understand in Colombia,  if you live in the cities,
p72
aVyou're very far away from where  the war is actually happening,
p73
aVso you don't really understand it,
p74
aVand we asked the government  to give us access
p75
aVto as many demobilized guerrillas as possible.
p76
aVAnd we talked to about 60 of them
p77
aVbefore we felt we fully understood the problem.
p78
aVWe talked about \u2014 they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas,
p79
aVwhy the left the guerrillas, what their dreams were,
p80
aVwhat their frustrations were,
p81
aVand from those conversations came the underlying insight
p82
aVthat has guided this whole campaign,
p83
aVwhich is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations
p84
aVas the people they hold hostage.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd at the beginning, we were so touched by these stories,
p87
aVwe were so amazed by these stories,
p88
aVthat we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas
p89
aVwas to have them talk to themselves,
p90
aVso we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year,
p91
aVand we put them on the radio and television
p92
aVso that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories, their stories,
p93
aVor stories similar to theirs,
p94
aVand when they heard them, they decided to go out.
p95
aa(lp96
VI want to tell you one of these stories.
p97
aVThis person you see here  is Giovanni Andres.
p98
aVGiovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture.
p99
aVHe had been seven years in the guerrilla, and he had demobilized very recently.
p100
aVHis story is the following:
p101
aVHe was recruited when he was 17,
p102
aVand sometime later, in his squadron, if you will,
p103
aVthis beautiful girl was recruited, and they fell in love.
p104
aVTheir conversations were about what their family was going to be like,
p105
aVwhat their kids' names would be,
p106
aVhow their life would be when they left the guerrilla.
p107
aVBut it turns out
p108
aVthat love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,
p109
aVso their romance was discovered and they were separated.
p110
aVHe was sent very far away, and she was left behind.
p111
aVShe was very familiar with the territory,
p112
aVso one night, when she was on guard,
p113
aVshe just left,
p114
aVand she went to the army, she demobilized,
p115
aVand she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to,
p116
aVand we were really touched by this story,
p117
aVso we made a radio spot,
p118
aVand it turns out, by chance,
p119
aVthat far away, many,  many kilometers north,
p120
aVhe heard her on the radio,
p121
aVand when he heard her on the radio, he said, "What am I doing here?
p122
aVShe had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing."
p123
aVAnd he did.
p124
aVHe walked for two days and two nights,
p125
aVand he risked his life and he got out,
p126
aVand the only thing he wanted was to see her.
p127
aVThe only thing that was in his mind was to see her.
p128
aVThe story was, they did meet.
p129
aVI know you're wondering if they did meet.
p130
aVThey did meet.
p131
aVShe had been recruited when she was 15, and she left when she was 17,
p132
aVso there were a lot of other complications,
p133
aVbut they did eventually meet.
p134
aVI don't know if they're together now, but I can find out. (Laughter)
p135
aVBut what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.
p136
aa(lp137
VThe problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
p138
aVIt was not working with the commanders,
p139
aVthe people that are more difficult to replace,
p140
aVbecause you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders.
p141
aVSo we thought, well, we'll use the same strategy.
p142
aVWe'll have commanders talking to commanders.
p143
aVAnd we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla
p144
aVto fly on helicopters with microphones
p145
aVtelling the people that used to fight with them,
p146
aV"There is a better life out there,"
p147
aV"I'm doing good," "This is not worth it," etc.
p148
aVBut, as you can all imagine, it was very easy to counteract,
p149
aVbecause what was the guerrilla going to say?
p150
aV"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that, he's going to get killed."
p151
aVSo it was easy, so we were suddenly left with nothing,
p152
aVbecause the guerrilla were spreading the word
p153
aVthat all of those things are done
p154
aVbecause if they don't do it,  they're in danger.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd somebody, some brilliant person in our team,
p157
aVcame back and said, "You know what I noticed?
p158
aVI noticed that around Christmastime,
p159
aVthere have been peaks of demobilization
p160
aVsince this war has started."
p161
aVAnd that was incredible,
p162
aVbecause that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being
p163
aVand not to the soldier.
p164
aVWe needed to step away from talking
p165
aVfrom government to army, from army to army,
p166
aVand we needed to talk about the universal values,
p167
aVand we needed to talk about humanity.
p168
aVAnd that was when the Christmas tree happened.
p169
aVThis picture that I have here,
p170
aVyou see this is the planning of the Christmas trees,
p171
aVand that man you see there with the three stars,
p172
aVhe's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.
p173
aVCaptain Valdez was the first  high-ranking official
p174
aVto give us the helicopters  and the support we needed
p175
aVto put these Christmas trees up,
p176
aVand he said in that meeting something that I will never forget.
p177
aVHe said, "I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger,
p178
aVmakes my men feel stronger."
p179
aVAnd I get very emotional when I remember him
p180
aVbecause he was killed later in combat and we really miss him,
p181
aVbut I wanted you all to see him, because he was really, really important.
p182
aVHe gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees.
p183
aa(lp184
VWhat happened later is that the guerrillas who came out
p185
aVduring the Christmas tree  operation and all of that
p186
aVsaid, "That's really good, Christmas trees are really cool,
p187
aVbut you know what? We really don't walk anymore.
p188
aVWe use rivers."
p189
aa(lp190
VSo rivers are the highways of the jungle,
p191
aVand this is something we learned,
p192
aVand most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages.
p193
aVSo we went to these river villages,
p194
aVand we asked the people,
p195
aVand probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.
p196
aVWe asked them, "Can you send guerrillas a message?"
p197
aVWe collected over 6,000 messages.
p198
aVSome of them were notes saying, get out.
p199
aVSome of them were toys. Some of them were candy.
p200
aVEven people took off their jewelry, their little crosses and religious things,
p201
aVand put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers
p202
aVso that they could be picked up at night.
p203
aVAnd we sent thousands of these down the rivers,
p204
aVand then picked them up later if they weren't.
p205
aVBut lots of them were picked up.
p206
aVThis generated, on average, a demobilization every six hours,
p207
aVso this was incredible and it was about: Come home at Christmas.
p208
aa(lp209
VThen came the peace process,
p210
aVand when the peace process started,
p211
aVthe whole mindset of the guerrilla changed.
p212
aVAnd it changed because
p213
aVit makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process,
p214
aVthis is probably going to be over.
p215
aVAt some point I'm going to get out."
p216
aVAnd their fears completely changed,
p217
aVand their fears were not about, "Am I going to get killed?"
p218
aVTheir fears were, "Am I going to be rejected?
p219
aVWhen I get out of this, am I going to be rejected?"
p220
aVSo the past Christmas,  what we did was we asked \u2014
p221
aVwe found 27 mothers of guerrillas,
p222
aVand we asked them to give us  pictures of their children,
p223
aVwhen they only could recognize themselves, so as not to put their lives in danger,
p224
aVand we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get,
p225
aVwhich is, "Before you were a guerrilla, you were my child,
p226
aVso come home, I'm waiting for you."
p227
aVYou can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple.
p228
aV(Applause)
p229
aVThank you.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd these pictures were placed in many different places,
p232
aVand a lot of them came back,
p233
aVand it was really, really beautiful.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd then we decided to work with society.
p236
aVSo we did mothers around Christmastime.
p237
aVNow let's talk about the rest of the people.
p238
aVAnd you may be aware of this or not, but there was a World Cup this year,
p239
aVand Colombia played really well, and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.
p240
aVAnd what we did was tell the guerrillas,
p241
aV"Come, get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you."
p242
aVSo this was television, this was  all different types of media saying,
p243
aV"We are saving a place for you."
p244
aVThe soldier here in the commercial says,
p245
aV"I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter
p246
aVso that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup."
p247
aVEx-football players, radio announcers,
p248
aVeverybody was saving a place for the guerrilla.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo since we started this work a little over eight years ago,
p251
aV17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.
p252
aVI do not \u2014 (Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VThank you.
p255
aa(lp256
VI don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do,
p257
aVbut what I do know is that our work and the work that we do
p258
aVmay have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization,
p259
aVand it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision.
p260
aVIf that is true, advertising is still one of the most powerful tools of change
p261
aVthat we have available.
p262
aVAnd I speak not only my behalf,
p263
aVbut on behalf of all the colleagues I see here
p264
aVwho work in advertising,
p265
aVand of all the team that has worked with me to do this,
p266
aVthat if you want to change the world,
p267
aVor if you want to achieve  peace, please call us.
p268
aVWe'd love to help.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
