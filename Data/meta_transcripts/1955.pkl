VA herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,
p4
aVa flock of birds.
p5
aVMany animals gather in large groups
p6
aVthat are among the most wonderful spectacles
p7
aVin the natural world.
p8
aVBut why do these groups form?
p9
aVThe common answers include things like
p10
aVseeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs
p11
aVor gathering to mate or breed,
p12
aVand all of these explanations,
p13
aVwhile often true,
p14
aVmake a huge assumption about animal behavior,
p15
aVthat the animals are in control of their own actions,
p16
aVthat they are in charge of their bodies.
p17
aVAnd that is often not the case.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is Artemia, a brine shrimp.
p20
aVYou probably know it better as a sea monkey.
p21
aVIt's small, and it typically lives alone,
p22
aVbut it can gather in these large red swarms
p23
aVthat span for meters,
p24
aVand these form because of a parasite.
p25
aVThese shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.
p26
aVA tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut
p27
aVwith genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other.
p28
aVAs a freelance journalist, I sympathize.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVThe tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,
p31
aVbut it also does other things.
p32
aVIt castrates them,
p33
aVit changes their color from transparent to bright red,
p34
aVit makes them live longer,
p35
aVand as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,
p36
aVit makes them swim in groups.
p37
aVWhy? Because the tapeworm, like many other parasites,
p38
aVhas a complicated life cycle
p39
aVinvolving many different hosts.
p40
aVThe shrimp are just one step on its journey.
p41
aVIts ultimate destination is this,
p42
aVthe greater flamingo.
p43
aVOnly in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,
p44
aVso to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts
p45
aVinto forming these conspicuous colored swarms
p46
aVthat are easier for a flamingo to spot
p47
aVand to devour,
p48
aVand that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.
p49
aVThey aren't sociable through their own volition,
p50
aVbut because they are being controlled.
p51
aVIt's not safety in numbers.
p52
aVIt's actually the exact opposite.
p53
aVThe tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,
p54
aVturning them into vehicles
p55
aVfor getting itself into a flamingo.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd here is another example
p58
aVof a parasitic manipulation.
p59
aVThis is a suicidal cricket.
p60
aVThis cricket swallowed the  larvae of a Gordian worm,
p61
aVor horsehair worm.
p62
aVThe worm grew to adult size within it,
p63
aVbut it needs to get into water in order to mate,
p64
aVand it does that by releasing proteins
p65
aVthat addle the cricket's brain,
p66
aVcausing it to behave erratically.
p67
aVWhen the cricket nears a body of water,
p68
aVsuch as this swimming pool,
p69
aVit jumps in and drowns,
p70
aVand the worm wriggles out
p71
aVof its suicidal corpse.
p72
aVCrickets are really roomy. Who knew?
p73
aa(lp74
VThe tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.
p75
aVThey are part of an entire cavalcade
p76
aVof mind-controlling parasites,
p77
aVof fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more
p78
aVthat all specialize in subverting and overriding
p79
aVthe wills of their hosts.
p80
aVNow, I first learned about this way of life
p81
aVthrough David Attenborough's "Trials of Life"
p82
aVabout 20 years ago,
p83
aVand then later through a wonderful book called
p84
aV"Parasite Rex" by my friend Carl Zimmer.
p85
aVAnd I've been writing about these creatures ever since.
p86
aVFew topics in biology enthrall me more.
p87
aVIt's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.
p88
aVBecause after all, they are always compelling
p89
aVand they are delightfully macabre.
p90
aVWhen you write about parasites,
p91
aVyour lexicon swells with phrases like
p92
aV"devoured alive" and "bursts out of its body."
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut there's more to it than that.
p96
aVI'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience
p97
aVwill know that we love stories.
p98
aVParasites invite us to resist the allure
p99
aVof obvious stories.
p100
aVTheir world is one of plot twists
p101
aVand unexpected explanations.
p102
aVWhy, for example,
p103
aVdoes this caterpillar
p104
aVstart violently thrashing about
p105
aVwhen another insect gets close to it
p106
aVand those white cocoons that it seems
p107
aVto be standing guard over?
p108
aVIs it maybe protecting its siblings?
p109
aVNo.
p110
aVThis caterpillar was attacked
p111
aVby a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.
p112
aVThe eggs hatched and the young wasps
p113
aVdevoured the caterpillar alive
p114
aVbefore bursting out of its body.
p115
aVSee what I mean?
p116
aVNow, the caterpillar didn't die.
p117
aVSome of the wasps seemed to stay behind
p118
aVand controlled it into defending their siblings
p119
aVwhich are metamorphosing
p120
aVinto adults within those cocoons.
p121
aVThis caterpillar is a head-banging  zombie bodyguard
p122
aVdefending the offspring
p123
aVof the creature that killed it.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VWe have a lot to get through.  I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, some of you are probably just
p130
aVdesperately clawing for some solace
p131
aVin the idea that these things are oddities
p132
aVof the natural world, that they are outliers,
p133
aVand that point of view is understandable,
p134
aVbecause by their nature, parasites are quite small
p135
aVand they spend a lot of their time
p136
aVinside the bodies of other things.
p137
aVThey're easy to overlook,
p138
aVbut that doesn't mean that they aren't important.
p139
aVA few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty
p140
aVtook a group of scientists into three Californian estuaries
p141
aVand they pretty much weighed and dissected
p142
aVand recorded everything they could find,
p143
aVand what they found
p144
aVwere parasites in extreme abundance.
p145
aVEspecially common were trematodes,
p146
aVtiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts
p147
aVlike this unfortunate snail.
p148
aVNow, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,
p149
aVbut collectively they weighed as much
p150
aVas all the fish in the estuaries
p151
aVand three to nine times more than all the birds.
p152
aVAnd remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,
p153
aVthe cricket thing?
p154
aVOne Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato
p155
aVfound that in one stream,
p156
aVthese things drive so many crickets
p157
aVand grasshoppers into the water
p158
aVthat the drowned insects
p159
aVmake up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.
p160
aVManipulation is not an oddity.
p161
aVIt is a critical and common part
p162
aVof the world around us,
p163
aVand scientists have now found
p164
aVhundreds of examples of such manipulators,
p165
aVand more excitingly, they're starting to understand
p166
aVexactly how these creatures control their hosts.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd this is one of my favorite examples.
p169
aVThis is Ampulex compressa,
p170
aVthe emerald cockroach wasp,
p171
aVand it is a truth universally acknowledged
p172
aVthat an emerald cockroach wasp in possession
p173
aVof some fertilized eggs
p174
aVmust be in want of a cockroach.
p175
aVWhen she finds one,
p176
aVshe stabs it with a stinger
p177
aVthat is also a sense organ.
p178
aVThis discovery came out three weeks ago.
p179
aVShe stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ
p180
aVequipped with small sensory bumps
p181
aVthat allow her to feel the distinctive texture
p182
aVof a roach's brain.
p183
aVSo like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,
p184
aVshe finds the brain, and she injects it with venom
p185
aVinto two very specific clusters of neurons.
p186
aVIsraeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal
p187
aVfound that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon.
p188
aVIt doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
p189
aVThe roach could walk away
p190
aVor fly or run if it chose to,
p191
aVbut it doesn't choose to,
p192
aVbecause the venom nixes its motivation to walk,
p193
aVand only that.
p194
aVThe wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box
p195
aVin the roach's operating system,
p196
aVallowing her to lead her helpless victim
p197
aVback to her lair by its antennae
p198
aVlike a person walking a dog.
p199
aVAnd once there, she lays an egg on it,
p200
aVegg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,
p201
aVyadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.
p202
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VNow I would argue that, once stung,
p205
aVthe cockroach isn't a roach anymore.
p206
aVIt's more of an extension of the wasp,
p207
aVjust like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm.
p208
aVThese hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.
p209
aVThey have as much control over their own fates
p210
aVas my car.
p211
aVOnce the parasites get in,
p212
aVthe hosts don't get a say.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow humans, of course,
p215
aVare no stranger to manipulation.
p216
aVWe take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains
p217
aVand to change our moods,
p218
aVand what are arguments or advertising or big ideas
p219
aVif not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?
p220
aVBut our attempts at doing this
p221
aVare crude and blundering compared
p222
aVto the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.
p223
aVDon Draper only wishes he was as elegant
p224
aVand precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.
p225
aVNow, I think this is part of what makes parasites
p226
aVso sinister and so compelling.
p227
aVWe place such a premium on our free will
p228
aVand our independence
p229
aVthat the prospect of losing those qualities
p230
aVto forces unseen
p231
aVinforms many of our deepest societal fears.
p232
aVOrwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals
p233
aVand mind-controlling supervillains \u2014
p234
aVthese are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,
p235
aVbut in nature, they happen all the time.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhich leads me to an obvious
p238
aVand disquieting question:
p239
aVAre there dark, sinister parasites
p240
aVthat are influencing our behavior
p241
aVwithout us knowing about it,
p242
aVbesides the NSA?
p243
aVIf there are any \u2014
p244
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p245
aVI've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VIf there are any, this is a good candidate for them.
p249
aVThis is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,
p250
aVbecause the terrifying creature
p251
aValways deserves a cute nickname.
p252
aVToxo infects mammals,
p253
aVa wide variety of mammals,
p254
aVbut it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.
p255
aVAnd scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that
p256
aVif Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,
p257
aVit turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.
p258
aVIf the infected rat smells the delightful odor
p259
aVof cat piss,
p260
aVit runs towards the source of the smell
p261
aVrather than the more sensible direction of away.
p262
aVThe cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.
p263
aVIt's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.
p264
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VYou're very charitable, generous people.
p267
aVHi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.
p268
aa(lp269
VHow does the parasite control its host
p270
aVin this way?
p271
aVWe don't really know.
p272
aVWe know that Toxo releases an enzyme
p273
aVthat makes dopamine, a substance involved
p274
aVin reward and motivation.
p275
aVWe know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,
p276
aVincluding those involved in sexual arousal.
p277
aVBut how those puzzle pieces fit together
p278
aVis not immediately clear.
p279
aVWhat is clear is that this thing
p280
aVis a single cell.
p281
aVThis has no nervous system.
p282
aVIt has no consciousness.
p283
aVIt doesn't even have a body.
p284
aVBut it's manipulating a mammal?
p285
aVWe are mammals.
p286
aVWe are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,
p287
aVbut our brains have the same basic structure,
p288
aVthe same types of cells,
p289
aVthe same chemicals running through them,
p290
aVand the same parasites.
p291
aVEstimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest
p292
aVthat one in three people around the world
p293
aVhave Toxo in their brains.
p294
aVNow typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.
p295
aVThe parasite holds up in a dormant state
p296
aVfor a long period of time.
p297
aVBut there's some evidence that those people
p298
aVwho are carriers score slightly differently
p299
aVon personality questionnaires than other people,
p300
aVthat they have a slightly  higher risk of car accidents,
p301
aVand there's some evidence that people with schizophrenia
p302
aVare more likely to be infected.
p303
aVNow, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,
p304
aVand even among Toxo researchers,
p305
aVopinion is divided as to whether the parasite
p306
aVis truly influencing our behavior.
p307
aVBut given the widespread nature of such manipulations,
p308
aVit would be completely implausible
p309
aVfor humans to be the only species
p310
aVthat weren't similarly affected.
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd I think that this capacity to constantly
p313
aVsubvert our way of thinking about the world
p314
aVmakes parasites amazing.
p315
aVThey're constantly inviting us to look at the natural world sideways,
p316
aVand to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,
p317
aVwhether they're simple and obvious
p318
aVor baffling and puzzling,
p319
aVare not the results of individuals
p320
aVacting through their own accord
p321
aVbut because they are being bent
p322
aVto the control of something else.
p323
aVAnd while that idea may be disquieting,
p324
aVand while parasites' habits may be very grisly,
p325
aVI think that ability to surprise us
p326
aVmakes them as wonderful and as charismatic
p327
aVas any panda or butterfly or dolphin.
p328
aa(lp329
VAt the end of "On the Origin of Species,"
p330
aVCharles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,
p331
aVand of endless forms most beautiful
p332
aVand most wonderful,
p333
aVand I like to think he could easily have been talking
p334
aVabout a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable
p335
aVor a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.
p338
aa(lp339
VThank you.
