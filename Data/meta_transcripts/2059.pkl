VDr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
p4
aVin a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement,
p5
aVstates, "In the end,
p6
aVwe will remember not the words of our enemies
p7
aVbut the silence of our friends."
p8
aa(lp9
VAs a teacher, I've internalized this message.
p10
aVEvery day, all around us,
p11
aVwe see the consequences of silence
p12
aVmanifest themselves in the form of discrimination,
p13
aVviolence, genocide and war.
p14
aVIn the classroom, I challenge my students
p15
aVto explore the silences in their own lives
p16
aVthrough poetry.
p17
aVWe work together to fill those spaces,
p18
aVto recognize them, to name them,
p19
aVto understand that they don't have to be sources of shame.
p20
aVIn an effort to create a culture within my classroom
p21
aVwhere students feel safe sharing the intimacies
p22
aVof their own silences,
p23
aVI have four core principles posted on the board
p24
aVthat sits in the front of my class,
p25
aVwhich every student signs at the beginning of the year:
p26
aVread critically, write consciously,
p27
aVspeak clearly, tell your truth.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,
p30
aVtell your truth.
p31
aVAnd I realized that
p32
aVif I was going to ask my students to speak up,
p33
aVI was going to have to tell my truth
p34
aVand be honest with them about the times
p35
aVwhere I failed to do so.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I tell them that growing up,
p38
aVas a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,
p39
aVduring Lent I was always taught
p40
aVthat the most meaningful thing one could do
p41
aVwas to give something up,
p42
aVsacrifice something you typically indulge in
p43
aVto prove to God you understand his sanctity.
p44
aVI've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,
p45
aVFrench kisses, and everything in between.
p46
aVBut one year, I gave up speaking.
p47
aVI figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice
p48
aVwas my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized
p49
aVthat I had given that up a long time ago.
p50
aVI spent so much of my life
p51
aVtelling people the things they wanted to hear
p52
aVinstead of the things they needed to,
p53
aVtold myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience
p54
aVbecause I still had to figure out being my own,
p55
aVso sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,
p56
aVappeasing ignorance with my silence,
p57
aVunaware that validation doesn't need words
p58
aVto endorse its existence.
p59
aVWhen Christian was beat up for being gay,
p60
aVI put my hands in my pocket
p61
aVand walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice.
p62
aVI couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock
p63
aVreminded me of the one I had put on my lips
p64
aVwhen the homeless man on the corner
p65
aVlooked at me with eyes up merely searching
p66
aVfor an affirmation that he was worth seeing.
p67
aVI was more concerned with touching the screen on my Apple
p68
aVthan actually feeding him one.
p69
aVWhen the woman at the fundraising gala
p70
aVsaid "I'm so proud of you.
p71
aVIt must be so hard teaching those poor, unintelligent kids,"
p72
aVI bit my lip, because apparently we needed her money
p73
aVmore than my students needed their dignity.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe spend so much time
p76
aVlistening to the things people are saying
p77
aVthat we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.
p78
aVSilence is the residue of fear.
p79
aVIt is feeling your flaws
p80
aVgut-wrench guillotine your tongue.
p81
aVIt is the air retreating from your chest
p82
aVbecause it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.
p83
aVSilence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
p84
aVIt is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left.
p85
aVIt is the sound after the noose is already tied.
p86
aVIt is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.
p87
aVThere is no time to pick your battles
p88
aVwhen your battles have already picked you.
p89
aa(lp90
VI will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.
p91
aVI will tell Christian that he is a lion,
p92
aVa sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.
p93
aVI will ask that homeless man what his name is
p94
aVand how his day was, because sometimes
p95
aVall people want to be is human.
p96
aVI will tell that woman that my students can talk about
p97
aVtranscendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,
p98
aVand just because you watched one episode of "The Wire"
p99
aVdoesn't mean you know anything about my kids.
p100
aVSo this year,
p101
aVinstead of giving something up,
p102
aVI will live every day as if there were a microphone
p103
aVtucked under my tongue,
p104
aVa stage on the underside of my inhibition.
p105
aVBecause who has to have a soapbox
p106
aVwhen all you've ever needed is your voice?
p107
aa(lp108
VThank you.
