VPaul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote:
p4
aV"Productivity is not everything, but in the long run,
p5
aVit is almost everything."
p6
aa(lp7
VSo this is serious.
p8
aVThere are not that many things on earth that are "almost everything."
p9
aVProductivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society.
p10
aVSo we have a problem.
p11
aVIn the largest European economies,
p12
aVproductivity used to grow five percent per annum
p13
aVin the '50s, '60s, early '70s.
p14
aVFrom '73 to '83: three percent per annum.
p15
aVFrom '83 to '95: two percent per annum.
p16
aVSince 1995: less than one percent per annum.
p17
aVThe same profile in Japan.
p18
aVThe same profile in the US,
p19
aVdespite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,
p20
aVand despite all the technological innovations
p21
aVaround us: the Internet, the information,
p22
aVthe new information and communication technologies.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhen productivity grows three percent per annum,
p25
aVyou double the standard of living every generation.
p26
aVEvery generation is twice as well-off as its parents'.
p27
aVWhen it grows one percent per annum,
p28
aVit takes three generations to double the standard of living.
p29
aVAnd in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents.
p30
aVThey will have less of everything:
p31
aVsmaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,
p32
aVless access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination \u2014
p33
aVto everything.
p34
aVThink of all the problems that we're facing at the moment.
p35
aVAll.
p36
aVChances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis.
p37
aa(lp38
VWhy this crisis?
p39
aVBecause the basic tenets about efficiency \u2014
p40
aVeffectiveness in organizations, in management \u2014
p41
aVhave become counterproductive for human efforts.
p42
aVEverywhere in public services \u2014 in companies, in the way we work,
p43
aVthe way we innovate, invest \u2014 try to learn to work better.
p44
aVTake the holy trinity of efficiency:
p45
aVclarity, measurement, accountability.
p46
aVThey make human efforts derail.
p47
aa(lp48
VThere are two ways to look at it, to prove it.
p49
aVOne, the one I prefer,
p50
aVis rigorous, elegant, nice \u2014 math.
p51
aVBut the full math version takes a little while,
p52
aVso there is another one.
p53
aVIt is to look at a relay race.
p54
aVThis is what we will do today.
p55
aVIt's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster \u2014 it's a race.
p56
aVHopefully, it's faster.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VWorld championship final \u2014 women.
p61
aVEight teams in the final.
p62
aVThe fastest team is the US team.
p63
aVThey have the fastest women on earth.
p64
aVThey are the favorite team to win.
p65
aVNotably, if you compare them to an average team,
p66
aVsay, the French team,
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
Vbased on their best performances in the 100-meter race,
p71
aVif you add the individual times of the US runners,
p72
aVthey arrive at the finish line 3.2 meters ahead of the French team.
p73
aVAnd this year, the US team is in great shape.
p74
aVBased on their best performance this year,
p75
aVthey arrive 6.4 meters ahead of the French team,
p76
aVbased on the data.
p77
aVWe are going to look at the race.
p78
aVAt some point you will see, towards the end,
p79
aVthat Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead.
p80
aVNot surprising \u2014 this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race.
p81
aVAnd by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team,
p82
aVis the fastest woman on earth.
p83
aVSo, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.
p84
aVWhere are the two fastest? On the US team.
p85
aVAnd the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VSo clearly, the US team has won the war for talent.
p90
aVBut behind, the average team is trying to catch up.
p91
aVLet's watch the race.
p92
aa(lp93

p96
aa(lp97
VYves Morieux: So what happened?
p98
aVThe fastest team did not win; the slower one did.
p99
aVBy the way, I hope you appreciate
p100
aVthe deep historical research I did to make the French look good.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut let's not exaggerate \u2014 it's not archeology, either.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VBut why?
p109
aVBecause of cooperation.
p110
aVWhen you hear this sentence:
p111
aV"Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts."
p112
aVThis is not poetry; this is not philosophy.
p113
aVThis is math.
p114
aVThose who carry the baton are slower,
p115
aVbut their baton is faster.
p116
aVMiracle of cooperation:
p117
aVit multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts.
p118
aVIt is the essence of human efforts:
p119
aVhow we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others.
p120
aVWith cooperation, we can do more with less.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail \u2014
p123
aVthe holy trinity, even \u2014
p124
aVof clarity, measurement, accountability \u2014
p125
aVappears?
p126
aa(lp127
VClarity.
p128
aVManagement reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity.
p129
aVCompliance audits, consultants' diagnostics.
p130
aVWe need more clarity, we need to clarify the roles, the processes.
p131
aVIt is as though the runners on the team were saying,
p132
aV"Let's be clear \u2014 where does my role really start and end?
p133
aVAm I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97...?"
p134
aVIt's important, let's be clear.
p135
aVIf you say 97, after 97 meters,
p136
aVpeople will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not.
p137
aa(lp138
VAccountability.
p139
aVWe are constantly trying to put accountability
p140
aVin someone's hands.
p141
aVWho is accountable for this process?
p142
aVWe need somebody accountable for this process.
p143
aVSo in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important,
p144
aVthen we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton.
p145
aVSo between each runner,
p146
aVnow we will have a new dedicated athlete,
p147
aVclearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner,
p148
aVand passing it to the next runner.
p149
aVAnd we will have at least two like that.
p150
aVWell, will we, in that case, win the race?
p151
aVThat I don't know, but for sure,
p152
aVwe would have a clear interface,
p153
aVa clear line of accountability.
p154
aVWe will know who to blame.
p155
aVBut we'll never win the race.
p156
aVIf you think about it, we pay more attention
p157
aVto knowing who to blame in case we fail,
p158
aVthan to creating the conditions to succeed.
p159
aVAll the human intelligence put in organization design \u2014
p160
aVurban structures, processing systems \u2014
p161
aVwhat is the real goal?
p162
aVTo have somebody guilty in case they fail.
p163
aVWe are creating organizations able to fail,
p164
aVbut in a compliant way,
p165
aVwith somebody clearly accountable when we fail.
p166
aVAnd we are quite effective at that \u2014 failing.
p167
aa(lp168
VMeasurement.
p169
aVWhat gets measured gets done.
p170
aVLook, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time,
p171
aVin the right hand, at the right speed.
p172
aVBut to do that, you have to put energy in your arm.
p173
aVThis energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs.
p174
aVIt will come at the expense of your measurable speed.
p175
aVYou have to shout early enough to the next runner
p176
aVwhen you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving,
p177
aVso that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate.
p178
aVAnd you have to shout loud.
p179
aVBut the blood, the energy that will be in your throat
p180
aVwill not be in your legs.
p181
aVBecause you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time.
p182
aVSo you have to recognize the voice of your colleague.
p183
aVYou cannot say, "Is it you?"
p184
aVToo late!
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, let's look at the race in slow motion,
p189
aVand concentrate on the third runner.
p190
aVLook at where she allocates her efforts,
p191
aVher energy, her attention.
p192
aVNot all in her legs \u2014 that would be great for her own speed \u2014
p193
aVbut in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain.
p194
aVThat makes a difference in whose legs?
p195
aVIn the legs of the next runner.
p196
aVBut when the next runner runs super-fast,
p197
aVis it because she made a super effort,
p198
aVor because of the way the third runner passed the baton?
p199
aVThere is no metric on earth that will give us the answer.
p200
aVAnd if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance,
p201
aVthey will put their energy, their attention, their blood
p202
aVin what can get measured \u2014 in their legs.
p203
aVAnd the baton will fall and slow down.
p204
aa(lp205
VTo cooperate is not a super effort,
p206
aVit is how you allocate your effort.
p207
aVIt is to take a risk,
p208
aVbecause you sacrifice the ultimate protection
p209
aVgranted by objectively measurable individual performance.
p210
aVIt is to make a super difference in the performance of others,
p211
aVwith whom we are compared.
p212
aVIt takes being stupid to cooperate, then.
p213
aVAnd people are not stupid; they don't cooperate.
p214
aa(lp215
VYou know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK
p216
aVwhen the world was simpler.
p217
aVBut business has become much more complex.
p218
aVWith my teams, we have measured
p219
aVthe evolution of complexity in business.
p220
aVIt is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers,
p221
aVto build advantage on a global scale,
p222
aVto create value.
p223
aVAnd the more business gets complex,
p224
aVthe more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement
p225
aVwe multiply structures, processes, systems.
p226
aa(lp227
VYou know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers
p228
aVa counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices,
p229
aVcoordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources,
p230
aVbut that also add obstacles.
p231
aVAnd the more complicated the organization,
p232
aVthe more difficult it is to understand what is really happening.
p233
aVSo we need summaries, proxies, reports,
p234
aVkey performance indicators, metrics.
p235
aVSo people put their energy in what can get measured,
p236
aVat the expense of cooperation.
p237
aVAnd as performance deteriorates,
p238
aVwe add even more structure, process, systems.
p239
aVPeople spend their time in meetings,
p240
aVwriting reports they have to do, undo and redo.
p241
aVBased on our analysis, teams in these organizations
p242
aVspend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time,
p243
aVbut working harder and harder, longer and longer,
p244
aVon less and less value-adding activities.
p245
aVThis is what is killing productivity,
p246
aVwhat makes people suffer at work.
p247
aa(lp248
VOur organizations are wasting human intelligence.
p249
aVThey have turned against human efforts.
p250
aVWhen people don't cooperate,
p251
aVdon't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality \u2014
p252
aVlook at the work situations.
p253
aVIs it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not,
p254
aVif, when they cooperate, they are individually worse off?
p255
aVWhy would they cooperate?
p256
aVWhen we blame personalities
p257
aVinstead of the clarity, the accountability, the measurement,
p258
aVwe add injustice to ineffectiveness.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe need to create organizations
p261
aVin which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate.
p262
aVRemove the interfaces, the middle offices \u2014
p263
aVall these complicated coordination structures.
p264
aVDon't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.
p265
aVFuzziness overlaps.
p266
aVRemove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance.
p267
aVSpeed the "what."
p268
aVLook at cooperation, the "how."
p269
aVHow did you pass the baton?
p270
aVDid you throw it, or did you pass it effectively?
p271
aVAm I putting my energy in what can get measured \u2014
p272
aVmy legs, my speed \u2014 or in passing the baton?
p273
aa(lp274
VYou, as leaders, as managers,
p275
aVare you making it individually useful for people to cooperate?
p276
aVThe future of our organizations,
p277
aVour companies, our societies
p278
aVhinges on your answer to these questions.
p279
aa(lp280
VThank you.
