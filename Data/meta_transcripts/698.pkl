VIt's a bit funny to be
p4
aVat a conference dedicated to things not seen,
p5
aVand present my proposal to build
p6
aVa 6,000-kilometer-long wall
p7
aVacross the entire African continent.
p8
aVAbout the size of the Great Wall of China,
p9
aVthis would hardly be an invisible structure.
p10
aVAnd yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:
p11
aVbacteria and grains of sand.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, as architects we're trained to solve problems.
p14
aVBut I don't really believe in architectural problems;
p15
aVI only believe in opportunities.
p16
aVWhich is why I'll show you a threat,
p17
aVand an architectural response.
p18
aVThe threat is desertification.
p19
aVMy response is a sandstone wall
p20
aVmade from bacteria and solidified sand,
p21
aVstretching across the desert.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, sand is a magical material
p24
aVof beautiful contradictions.
p25
aVIt is simple and complex.
p26
aVIt is peaceful and violent.
p27
aVIt is always the same, never the same,
p28
aVendlessly fascinating.
p29
aVOne billion grains of sand
p30
aVcome into existence in the world each second.
p31
aVThat's a cyclical process.
p32
aVAs rocks and mountains die,
p33
aVgrains of sand are born.
p34
aVSome of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.
p35
aVAnd as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.
p36
aVSome of those grains may then accumulate
p37
aVon a massive scale,
p38
aVinto a sand dune.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn a way, the static, stone mountain
p41
aVbecomes a moving mountain of sand.
p42
aVBut, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.
p43
aVDry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.
p44
aVSome are already deserts;
p45
aVothers are being seriously degraded by the sand.
p46
aVJust south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.
p47
aVThe name means "edge of the desert."
p48
aVAnd this is the region most closely associated with desertification.
p49
aVIt was here in the late '60s and early '70s
p50
aVthat major droughts brought three million people
p51
aVto become dependent upon emergency food aid,
p52
aVwith about up to 250,000 dying.
p53
aa(lp54
VThis is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.
p55
aVAnd it's one that gets very little attention.
p56
aVIn our accelerated media culture,
p57
aVdesertification is simply too slow
p58
aVto reach the headlines.
p59
aVIt's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:
p60
aVtoo few crying children and smashed up houses.
p61
aVAnd yet desertification
p62
aVis a major threat on all continents,
p63
aVaffecting some 110 countries
p64
aVand about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.
p65
aa(lp66
VIt seriously threatens the livelihoods
p67
aVof millions of people,
p68
aVand especially in Africa and China.
p69
aVAnd it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves
p70
aVthrough unsustainable use of scarce resources.
p71
aVSo, we get climate change.
p72
aVWe get droughts,
p73
aVincreased desertification,
p74
aVcrashing food systems, water scarcity,
p75
aVfamine, forced migration,
p76
aVpolitical instability, warfare, crisis.
p77
aVThat's a potential scenario
p78
aVif we fail to take this seriously.
p79
aVBut, how far away is it?
p80
aa(lp81
VI went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria
p82
aVto try and find out how far away it is.
p83
aVThe dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.
p84
aVThat's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,
p85
aVphysically pushing people away from their homes.
p86
aVHere I am \u2014 I'm the second person on the left \u2014
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVwith the elders in Gidan-Kara,
p89
aVa tiny village outside of Sokoto.
p90
aa(lp91
VThey had to move this village in 1987
p92
aVas a huge dune threatened to swallow it.
p93
aVSo, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.
p94
aVThis is where the village used to be.
p95
aVIt took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,
p96
aVwhich goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.
p97
aVThat's the kind of forced migration
p98
aVthat desertification can lead to.
p99
aVIf you happen to live close to the desert border,
p100
aVyou can pretty much calculate how long it will be
p101
aVbefore you have to carry your kids away,
p102
aVand abandon your home and your life as you know it.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.
p105
aVAnd still, those extreme environments are very good places
p106
aVif we want to stop the shifting sands.
p107
aVFour years ago, 23 African countries
p108
aVcame together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.
p109
aVA fantastic project, the initial plan
p110
aVcalled for a shelter belt of trees to be planted
p111
aVright across the African continent,
p112
aVfrom Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.
p113
aVIf you want to stop a sand dune from moving,
p114
aVwhat you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains
p115
aVfrom avalanching over its crest.
p116
aVAnd a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,
p117
aVis to use some kind of sand catcher.
p118
aVTrees or cacti are good for this.
p119
aVBut, one of the problems with planting trees is that
p120
aVthe people in these regions are so poor
p121
aVthat they chop them down for firewood.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow there is an alternative to just planting trees
p124
aVand hoping that they won't get chopped down.
p125
aVThis sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.
p126
aVIt adds roughness to the dune's surface,
p127
aVto the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
p128
aVIt provides a physical support structure for the trees,
p129
aVand it creates physical spaces,
p130
aVhabitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.
p131
aVIf people live inside of the green barrier
p132
aVthey can help support the trees, protect them from humans,
p133
aVand from some of the forces of nature.
p134
aVInside of the dunes we find shade.
p135
aVWe can start harvesting condensation,
p136
aVand start greening the desert from within.
p137
aa(lp138
VSand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.
p139
aVAll we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,
p140
aVand then excavate the sand,
p141
aVand we have our architecture.
p142
aVWe can either excavate it by hand
p143
aVor we can have the wind excavate it for us.
p144
aVSo, the wind carries the sand onto the site
p145
aVand then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut, by now, you're probably asking,
p148
aVhow am I planning to solidify a sand dune?
p149
aVHow do we glue those grains of sand together?
p150
aVAnd the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,
p151
aVBacillus pasteurii,
p152
aVa micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands
p153
aVand marshes, and does precisely that.
p154
aVIt takes a pile of loose sand
p155
aVand it creates sandstone out of it.
p156
aVThese images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhat happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,
p159
aVand it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.
p160
aVA chemical process produces calcite,
p161
aVwhich is a kind of natural cement
p162
aVthat binds the grains together.
p163
aVThe whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.
p164
aVI learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.
p165
aVHe managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
p166
aVHere I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,
p167
aVworking with the bugs at UCL in London,
p168
aVtrying to solidify them.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo, how much would this cost?
p171
aVI'm not an economist, very much not,
p172
aVbut I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation \u2014
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aV\u2014 and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete
p175
aVwe would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.
p176
aVAnd, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,
p177
aVwhich you'll never have to pay again,
p178
aVone cubic meter of bacterial sand
p179
aVwould be about 11 dollars.
p180
aa(lp181
VHow do we construct something like this?
p182
aVWell, I'll quickly show you two options.
p183
aVThe first is to create a kind of balloon structure,
p184
aVfill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,
p185
aVpop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.
p186
aVThen, a few years afterwards,
p187
aVusing permacultural strategies,
p188
aVwe green that part of the desert.
p189
aa(lp190
VThe second alternative would be to use injection piles.
p191
aVSo, we pushed the piles down through the dune,
p192
aVand we create an initial bacterial surface.
p193
aVWe then pull the piles up through the dune
p194
aVand we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand
p195
aVwith the sand acting as a mold as we go up.
p196
aVSo, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,
p197
aVand then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.
p198
aa(lp199
VBut, what should they look like?
p200
aVWell, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,
p201
aVwhich look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.
p202
aVThese are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.
p203
aVAnd I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me
p204
aVwith good spatial qualities,
p205
aVfor ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.
p206
aVNow, part of the formal control over this structure
p207
aVwould be lost to nature, obviously,
p208
aVas the bacteria do their work.
p209
aVAnd I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.
p210
aVI think there is really something in that articulation
p211
aVthat is quite nice.
p212
aVWe see the result, the traces, if you like,
p213
aVof the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert
p214
aVinto these habitable environments.
p215
aa(lp216
VSome people believe that
p217
aVthis would spread uncontrollably,
p218
aVand that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.
p219
aVThat's not true at all.
p220
aVIt's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,
p221
aVand the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.
p222
aVSo, there it is \u2014
p223
aVarchitectural anti-desertification structures
p224
aVmade from the desert itself.
p225
aVSand-stopping devices, made from sand.
p226
aVThe world is likely to lose one third of its arable land
p227
aVby the end of the century.
p228
aVIn a period of unprecedented population growth
p229
aVand increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.
p230
aVAnd quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.
p231
aa(lp232
VIf nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.
p233
aVBut, if I had something like a TED wish,
p234
aVit would be to actually get it built,
p235
aVto start building this habitable wall,
p236
aVthis very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,
p237
aVbuilt into the dunescape itself.
p238
aVIt's not only something that supports trees,
p239
aVbut something that connects people and countries together.
p240
aVI would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,
p241
aVand leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.
p242
aa(lp243
VBorges said that "nothing is built on stone,
p244
aVeverything is built on sand,
p245
aVbut we must build as if the sand were stone."
p246
aa(lp247
VNow, there are many details left to explore in this scheme \u2014
p248
aVpolitical, practical, ethical, financial.
p249
aVMy design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,
p250
aVis fraught with many challenges
p251
aVand difficulties in the real world.
p252
aVBut, it's a beginning, it's a vision.
p253
aVAs Borges would have it, it's the sand.
p254
aVAnd I think now is really the time
p255
aVto turn it into stone. Thank you.
