p1
(lp2
(lp3
V18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,
p4
aVso I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point
p5
aVwhere I get this thing to work.
p6
aVHere we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
p7
aVI'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
p8
aVI'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,
p9
aVand actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
p10
aVI'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
p11
aVI'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic
p12
aVabout doing anything about aging.
p13
aVAnd then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk
p14
aVtalking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,
p15
aVnamely, by actually doing something about it.
p16
aa(lp17
VI'm going to do that in two steps.
p18
aVThe first one I'm going to talk about is
p19
aVhow to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension \u2014
p20
aVwhich I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people
p21
aVwho are already in middle-age when you start \u2014
p22
aVto a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
p23
aVNamely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between
p24
aVhow old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year \u2014
p25
aVor indeed, to get sick in the first place.
p26
aVAnd of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about
p27
aVis how to reach that intermediate step,
p28
aVthat point of maybe 30 years life extension.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I'm going to start with why we should.
p31
aVNow, I want to ask a question.
p32
aVHands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
p33
aVThat was easy. OK.
p34
aVOK. Hands up: anyone in the audience
p35
aVwho's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
p36
aVOK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
p37
aVThat's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
p38
aVNow the thing is, I would like to put it to you
p39
aVthat the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing
p40
aVis because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
p41
aVAnd here is that characteristic.
p42
aVThe only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,
p45
aVto talk about the comparison with foxhunting,
p46
aVwhich is something that was banned after a long struggle,
p47
aVby the government not very many months ago.
p48
aVI mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,
p49
aVbut, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
p50
aVAnd this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
p51
aVYou know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,
p52
aVcity boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
p53
aVIt's a traditional part of the way of life,
p54
aVand we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
p55
aVIt's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."
p56
aVBut ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,
p57
aVbecause the majority of the British public,
p58
aVand certainly the majority of members of Parliament,
p59
aVcame to the conclusion that it was really something
p60
aVthat should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd I think that human aging shares
p63
aVall of these characteristics in spades.
p64
aVWhat part of this do people not understand?
p65
aVIt's not just about life, of course \u2014
p66
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p67
aVit's about healthy life, you know \u2014
p68
aVgetting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,
p69
aVwhether or not dying may be fun.
p70
aVSo really, this is how I would like to describe it.
p71
aVIt's a global trance.
p72
aVThese are the sorts of unbelievable excuses
p73
aVthat people give for aging.
p74
aVAnd, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying
p75
aVthat these excuses are completely valueless.
p76
aVThere are some good points to be made here,
p77
aVthings that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning
p78
aVso that nothing goes too \u2014 well, so that we minimize
p79
aVthe turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut these are completely crazy, when you actually
p82
aVremember your sense of proportion.
p83
aVYou know, these are arguments; these are things that
p84
aVwould be legitimate to be concerned about.
p85
aVBut the question is, are they so dangerous \u2014
p86
aVthese risks of doing something about aging \u2014
p87
aVthat they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,
p88
aVnamely, leaving aging as it is?
p89
aVAre these so bad that they outweigh
p90
aVcondemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
p91
aVYou know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,
p92
aVthen just don't waste my time, is what I say.
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, there is one argument
p96
aVthat some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
p97
aVPeople worry about overpopulation; they say,
p98
aV"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,
p99
aVor at least the death toll is going to be much lower,
p100
aVonly from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
p101
aVAnd therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,
p102
aVand kids are really important to most people."
p103
aVAnd that's true.
p104
aVAnd you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,
p105
aVand give answers like this.
p106
aVI don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
p107
aVI think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
p108
aVWe will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,
p109
aVor a high death rate.
p110
aVA high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,
p111
aVin favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd, I say that that's fine \u2014
p114
aVthe future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
p115
aVWhat's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
p116
aVIf we vacillate, hesitate,
p117
aVand do not actually develop these therapies,
p118
aVthen we are condemning a whole cohort of people \u2014
p119
aVwho would have been young enough and healthy enough
p120
aVto benefit from those therapies, but will not be,
p121
aVbecause we haven't developed them as quickly as we could \u2014
p122
aVwe'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,
p123
aVand I consider that that is immoral.
p124
aVThat's my answer to the overpopulation question.
p125
aa(lp126
VRight. So the next thing is,
p127
aVnow why should we get a little bit more active on this?
p128
aVAnd the fundamental answer is that
p129
aVthe pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
p130
aVIt's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
p131
aVAging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,
p132
aVwe've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,
p133
aVand it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
p134
aVLike, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons
p135
aVwhy aging is actually a good thing after all.
p136
aVBut of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
p137
aVAnd as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear \u2014
p138
aVand we might be in range of doing something about aging \u2014
p139
aVthis becomes part of the problem.
p140
aVThis pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
p141
aVAnd that's why we have to really talk about this a lot \u2014
p142
aVevangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot \u2014
p143
aVin order to get people's attention, and make people realize
p144
aVthat they are in a trance in this regard.
p145
aVSo that's all I'm going to say about that.
p146
aa(lp147
VI'm now going to talk about feasibility.
p148
aVAnd the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable
p149
aVis summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
p150
aVA very simple definition.
p151
aVAging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,
p152
aVwhich is to say, metabolism.
p153
aVThis is not a completely tautological statement;
p154
aVit's a reasonable statement.
p155
aVAging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,
p156
aVand it also happens to us,
p157
aVdespite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,
p158
aVbecause those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo basically, metabolism, which is defined as
p161
aVbasically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,
p162
aVhas side effects.
p163
aVThose side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
p164
aVThat's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:
p165
aVwe can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
p166
aVAnd there are really two games in town,
p167
aVaccording to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
p168
aVThey're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."
p169
aVThe geriatrician will intervene late in the day,
p170
aVwhen pathology is becoming evident,
p171
aVand the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,
p172
aVand stop the accumulation of side effects
p173
aVfrom causing the pathology quite so soon.
p174
aVOf course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,
p175
aVbecause the things that are causing the pathology
p176
aVare becoming more abundant as time goes on.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,
p179
aVbecause, you know, prevention is better than cure.
p180
aVBut unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
p181
aVIn fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work \u2014
p182
aVeven cells we're not really too good on yet.
p183
aVWe've discovered things like, for example,
p184
aVRNA interference only a few years ago,
p185
aVand this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
p186
aVBasically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,
p187
aVbut it is not an approach whose time has come
p188
aVwhen we're talking about intervention.
p189
aVSo then, what do we do about that?
p190
aVI mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,
p191
aVpretty ironclad, doesn't it?
p192
aa(lp193
VBut it isn't.
p194
aVBefore I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit
p195
aVinto what I'm calling step two.
p196
aVJust suppose, as I said, that we do acquire \u2014
p197
aVlet's say we do it today for the sake of argument \u2014
p198
aVthe ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life
p199
aVon people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
p200
aVI'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
p201
aVWhat would that actually mean
p202
aVfor how long people of various ages today \u2014
p203
aVor equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive \u2014
p204
aVwould actually live?
p205
aVIn order to answer that question \u2014 you might think it's simple,
p206
aVbut it's not simple.
p207
aVWe can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,
p208
aVthen they'll live 30 years longer."
p209
aVThat's the wrong answer.
p210
aVAnd the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
p211
aa(lp212
VThere are two sorts of technological progress really,
p213
aVfor this purpose.
p214
aVThere are fundamental, major breakthroughs,
p215
aVand there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
p216
aVNow, they differ a great deal
p217
aVin terms of the predictability of time frames.
p218
aVFundamental breakthroughs:
p219
aVvery hard to predict how long it's going to take
p220
aVto make a fundamental breakthrough.
p221
aVIt was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,
p222
aVand it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
p223
aVBut after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
p224
aVI think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened
p225
aVin the progression of the technology of powered flight.
p226
aVWe can think, really, that each one is sort of
p227
aVbeyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
p228
aVThe incremental advances have added up to something
p229
aVwhich is not incremental anymore.
p230
aa(lp231
VThis is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
p232
aVAnd you see it in all sorts of technologies.
p233
aVComputers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,
p234
aVhappening of course a bit later.
p235
aVYou can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics \u2014
p236
aVyou know, the same sort of time frame.
p237
aVSo I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,
p238
aVisn't a step at all.
p239
aVThat in fact, the people who are young enough
p240
aVto benefit from these first therapies
p241
aVthat give this moderate amount of life extension,
p242
aVeven though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,
p243
aVwill be at some sort of cusp.
p244
aVThey will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments
p245
aVthat will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
p246
aVIn other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
p247
aVThe therapies will be improving faster than
p248
aVthe remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
p249
aa(lp250
VThis is a very important point for me to get across.
p251
aVBecause, you know, most people, when they hear
p252
aVthat I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,
p253
aVthey think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades
p254
aVthat are so thoroughly eliminating aging
p255
aVthat those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
p256
aVI'm not saying that at all.
p257
aVI'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies
p258
aVwill be enough.
p259
aVThey'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things
p260
aVthat 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
p261
aVAnd the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
p262
aVI decided to give this a little name,
p263
aVwhich is "longevity escape velocity."
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aVWell, it seems to get the point across.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,
p268
aVin terms of remaining life expectancy,
p269
aVas measured by their health,
p270
aVfor given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
p271
aVIf you're already 100, or even if you're 80 \u2014
p272
aVand an average 80-year-old,
p273
aVwe probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,
p274
aVbecause you're too close to death's door
p275
aVfor the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
p276
aVYou won't be able to withstand them.
p277
aVBut if you're only 50, then there's a chance
p278
aVthat you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know \u2014
p279
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p280
aVeventually get through this
p281
aVand start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,
p282
aVin terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,
p283
aVand in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
p284
aVAnd of course, if you're a bit younger than that,
p285
aVthen you're never really even going
p286
aVto get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old \u2014
p289
aVwe don't know how old that person is today,
p290
aVbecause we don't know how long it's going to take
p291
aVto get these first-generation therapies.
p292
aVBut irrespective of that age,
p293
aVI'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 \u2014
p294
aVsubject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes \u2014
p295
aVis actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
p296
aVAnd that's quite a thought.
p297
aa(lp298
VAlright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,
p299
aVmy last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;
p300
aVnamely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension
p301
aVthat will allow us to get to escape velocity?
p302
aVAnd in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
p303
aVI have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
p304
aVI'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
p305
aVAnd this is what it is.
p306
aVI say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,
p307
aVwhich basically means mice that live about three years on average.
p308
aVWe do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
p309
aVAnd then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,
p310
aVand with those therapies, we get them to live,
p311
aVon average, to their fifth birthday.
p312
aVSo, in other words, we add two years \u2014
p313
aVwe treble their remaining lifespan,
p314
aVstarting from the point that we started the therapies.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame
p317
aVuntil we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
p318
aVWhich we can now, as I've explained,
p319
aVequivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
p320
aVSecondly, what does it mean for the public's perception
p321
aVof how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,
p322
aVstarting from the time we get the mice?
p323
aVAnd thirdly, the question is, what will it do
p324
aVto actually how much people want it?
p325
aVAnd it seems to me that the first question
p326
aVis entirely a biology question,
p327
aVand it's extremely hard to answer.
p328
aVOne has to be very speculative,
p329
aVand many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,
p330
aVthat we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
p331
aa(lp332
VI say that's nonsense.
p333
aVI say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
p334
aVWe need to give our best guess as to the time frame,
p335
aVin order to give people a sense of proportion
p336
aVso that they can assess their priorities.
p337
aVSo, I say that we have a 50/50 chance
p338
aVof reaching this RHR milestone,
p339
aVrobust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point
p340
aVthat we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
p341
aV15 years from the robust mouse.
p342
aVThe public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
p343
aVThe public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
p344
aVSo they'll probably think it's five years away.
p345
aVThey'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
p346
aVAnd finally, of course, I think it's fair to say
p347
aVthat a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now
p348
aVis the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
p349
aVThat will be history at this point,
p350
aVbecause it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,
p351
aVsince it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
p352
aVSo we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,
p353
aVand of course that has enormous implications.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,
p356
aVI'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
p357
aVI'm going to use this word "damage"
p358
aVto denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism
p359
aVand that eventually cause pathology.
p360
aVBecause the critical thing about this
p361
aVis that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,
p362
aVthe damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
p363
aVBut it is not part of metabolism itself.
p364
aVAnd this turns out to be useful.
p365
aVBecause we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
p366
aVWe can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics
p367
aVis that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate
p368
aVat which metabolism lays down this damage.
p369
aVAnd I'm going to explain exactly what damage is
p370
aVin concrete biological terms in a moment.
p371
aVAnd geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time
p372
aVby stopping the damage converting into pathology.
p373
aVAnd the reason it's a losing battle
p374
aVis because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
p377
aVWe can call it the "engineering approach,"
p378
aVand I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
p379
aVThe engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
p380
aVIt does not intervene in this process or this one.
p381
aVAnd that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,
p382
aVand it's something that we are within range of being able to do,
p383
aVbecause it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
p384
aVThe engineering approach simply says,
p385
aV"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage \u2014
p386
aVnot necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,
p387
aVso that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold
p388
aVthat must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."
p389
aVWe know that this threshold exists,
p390
aVbecause we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,
p391
aVeven though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
p392
aa(lp393
VWhy do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
p394
aVThe point about this slide is actually the bottom.
p395
aVIf we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,
p396
aVwe will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism
p397
aVis important for aging in one way or another.
p398
aVThis list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
p399
aVThe list on the right is also incomplete.
p400
aVIt's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,
p401
aVand it's just an incomplete list.
p402
aVBut I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete \u2014
p403
aVthis is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,
p404
aVside effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,
p405
aVor that might cause pathology.
p406
aVAnd there are only seven of them.
p407
aVThey're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
p408
aVCell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
p409
aa(lp410
VFirst of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
p411
aVOf course one can make a biological argument.
p412
aVOne can say, "OK, what are we made of?"
p413
aVWe're made of cells and stuff between cells.
p414
aVWhat can damage accumulate in?
p415
aVThe answer is: long-lived molecules,
p416
aVbecause if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed \u2014
p417
aVlike by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis \u2014 then the damage is gone, too.
p418
aVIt's got to be long-lived molecules.
p419
aVSo, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
p420
aVand that is pretty good news, because it means that,
p421
aVyou know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,
p422
aVso the fact that we haven't extended this list
p423
aVis a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
p424
aVHowever, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,
p425
aVin mice, in principle \u2014 and what I mean by in principle is,
p426
aVwe probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
p427
aVSome of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
p428
aa(lp429
VI haven't got time to go through them at all, but
p430
aVmy conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,
p431
aVthen we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,
p432
aVbut we do need to get serious about it.
p433
aVWe do need to really start trying.
p434
aVSo of course, there are some biologists in the audience,
p435
aVand I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
p436
aVYou may have been dissatisfied with this talk,
p437
aVbut fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
p438
aVI've published a great deal on this;
p439
aVI cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,
p440
aVand there's quite a lot of detail there.
p441
aVThe detail is what makes me confident
p442
aVof my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
p443
aVSo if you think that I'm wrong,
p444
aVyou'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
p445
aa(lp446
VAnd of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people
p447
aVwho call themselves gerontologists because,
p448
aVas with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,
p449
aVyou know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant
p450
aVand not really to take it seriously.
p451
aVSo, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,
p452
aVin order to understand whether this is true.
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd we'll just end with a few things.
p455
aVOne thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session
p456
aVwho said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,
p457
aVand everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."
p458
aVAnd you know what happened.
p459
aVSo, you know, this does happen.
p460
aVWe have various strategies \u2014 there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,
p461
aVwhich is basically an incentive to innovate,
p462
aVand to do what you think is going to work,
p463
aVand you get money for it if you win.
p464
aVThere's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
p465
aVThis is what's going to take a bit of money.
p466
aVBut, I mean, look \u2014 how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
p467
aVNot very long. OK.
p468
aV(Laughter)
p469
aVIt's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,
p470
aVbut it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
p471
aVAnd I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
p472
aVThank you.
p473
aV(Applause)
p474
aa(lp475
VChris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions
p476
aVbut I thought I would give people the chance.
p477
aVAudience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,
p478
aVwhy is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
p479
aV(Laughter)
p480
aa(lp481
VAG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
p482
aV(Laughter)
p483
aV(Applause)
p484
aa(lp485
VAudience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems
p486
aVto fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
p487
aVHowever, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,
p488
aVso when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
p489
aVSo, why does \u2014 evolution has \u2014 seems to have selected against immortality,
p490
aVwhen it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
p491
aa(lp492
VAG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question
p493
aVthat I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
p494
aVI'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,
p495
aVwhich I happen to agree with,
p496
aVwhich is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;
p497
aV[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
p498
aVIn other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;
p499
aVyou need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes
p500
aVin order to age more slowly,
p501
aVand that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
p502
aVSo, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,
p503
aVdoesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,
p504
aVliving a long time or by procreation,
p505
aVthere's a certain amount of modulation of that,
p506
aVwhich is why different species have different lifespans,
p507
aVbut that's why there are no immortal species.
p508
aa(lp509
VCA: The genes don't care but we do?
p510
aa(lp511
VAG: That's right.
p512
aa(lp513
VAudience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,
p514
aVthe average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
p515
aVIf I project that, that would make me think
p516
aVthat I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
p517
aVThat means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
p518
aa(lp519
VAG: If you lose a bit of weight.
p520
aV(Laughter)
p521
aVYour numbers are a bit out.
p522
aVThe standard numbers are that lifespans
p523
aVhave been growing at between one and two years per decade.
p524
aVSo, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
p525
aVBut I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
p526
aa(lp527
VAudience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults
p528
aVare actually in the human embryo,
p529
aVand that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
p530
aVIf that is indeed true,
p531
aVbiologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
p532
aVIf there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,
p533
aVas opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
p534
aa(lp535
VAG: There are technical implications certainly.
p536
aVBasically what we need to do is replace cells
p537
aVin those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,
p538
aVespecially neurons, but we don't want to replace them
p539
aVany faster than that \u2014 or not much faster anyway,
p540
aVbecause replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
p541
aVWhat I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on
p542
aVwas a little bit of an oversimplification.
p543
aVThere are species that have no aging \u2014 Hydra for example \u2014
p544
aVbut they do it by not having a nervous system \u2014
p545
aVand not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function
p546
aVon very long-lived cells.
