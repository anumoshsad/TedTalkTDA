VI heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
p4
aVShe's an Italian fashion designer.
p5
aVShe goes to this vintage store in Paris
p6
aVwith a friend of hers.
p7
aVShe's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga \u2014
p8
aVshe loves it.
p9
aVShe's turning it inside out.
p10
aVShe's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.
p11
aVHer friend says, "Buy it already."
p12
aVShe said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."
p13
aVNow, the academics in this audience may think,
p14
aV"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."
p15
aVBut to a fashionista, what it really is
p16
aVis a sign of Prada's genius:
p17
aVthat she can root through the history of fashion
p18
aVand pick the one jacket
p19
aVthat doesn't need to be changed by one iota,
p20
aVand to be current and to be now.
p21
aa(lp22
VYou might also be asking whether it's possible
p23
aVthat this is illegal for her to do this.
p24
aVWell, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.
p25
aVIn the fashion industry, there's very little
p26
aVintellectual property protection.
p27
aVThey have trademark protection,
p28
aVbut no copyright protection
p29
aVand no patent protection to speak of.
p30
aVAll they have, really, is trademark protection,
p31
aVand so it means that anybody
p32
aVcould copy any garment
p33
aVon any person in this room
p34
aVand sell it as their own design.
p35
aVThe only thing that they can't copy
p36
aVis the actual trademark label
p37
aVwithin that piece of apparel.
p38
aVThat's one reason that you see logos
p39
aVsplattered all over these products.
p40
aVIt's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists
p41
aVto knock off these designs
p42
aVbecause they can't knock off the logo.
p43
aVBut if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.
p44
aV(Laughter) Well, yeah.
p45
aVCanal Street, I know.
p46
aVAnd sometimes these are fun, right?
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry
p49
aVdoesn't have any copyright protection
p50
aVis because the courts decided long ago
p51
aVthat apparel is too utilitarian
p52
aVto qualify for copyright protection.
p53
aVThey didn't want a handful of designers
p54
aVowning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
p55
aVAnd then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve
p56
aVbecause Joe Blow owns it.
p57
aVBut too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?
p58
aVThis is Vivienne Westwood. No!
p59
aVWe think of it as maybe too silly,
p60
aVtoo unnecessary.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, those of you who are familiar with the logic
p63
aVbehind copyright protection \u2014
p64
aVwhich is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate \u2014
p65
aVmight be really surprised
p66
aVby both the critical success of the fashion industry
p67
aVand the economic success of this industry.
p68
aVWhat I'm going to argue today is that
p69
aVbecause there's no copyright protection
p70
aVin the fashion industry,
p71
aVfashion designers have actually been able to elevate
p72
aVutilitarian design,
p73
aVthings to cover our naked bodies,
p74
aVinto something that we consider art.
p75
aVBecause there's no copyright protection
p76
aVin this industry,
p77
aVthere's a very open and creative
p78
aVecology of creativity.
p79
aa(lp80
VUnlike their creative brothers and sisters,
p81
aVwho are sculptors or photographers
p82
aVor filmmakers or musicians,
p83
aVfashion designers can sample
p84
aVfrom all their peers' designs.
p85
aVThey can take any element from any garment
p86
aVfrom the history of fashion
p87
aVand incorporate it into their own design.
p88
aVThey're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.
p89
aVAnd here, I suspect,
p90
aVthey were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.
p91
aVMaybe just a little.
p92
aVCan't copyright a costume either.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, fashion designers have
p95
aVthe broadest palette imaginable
p96
aVin this creative industry.
p97
aVThis wedding dress here
p98
aVis actually made of sporks,
p99
aVand this dress is actually made of aluminum.
p100
aVI've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes
p101
aVas they walk through.
p102
aVSo, one of the magical side effects
p103
aVof having a culture of copying,
p104
aVwhich is really what it is,
p105
aVis the establishment of trends.
p106
aVPeople think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?
p107
aVWell, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.
p108
aa(lp109
VSome people believe that
p110
aVthere are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain
p111
aVwho sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,
p112
aVbut if you talk to any designer at any level,
p113
aVincluding these high-end designers,
p114
aVthey always say
p115
aVtheir main inspiration comes from the street:
p116
aVwhere people like you and me remix and match
p117
aVour own fashion looks.
p118
aVAnd that's where they really get a lot of their
p119
aVcreative inspiration,
p120
aVso it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow, the fast fashion giants have
p123
aVprobably benefited the most
p124
aVfrom the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.
p125
aVThey are notorious for knocking off high-end designs
p126
aVand selling them at very low prices.
p127
aVAnd they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,
p128
aVbut those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.
p129
aVThe courts have said over and over again, "You don't need
p130
aVany more intellectual property protection."
p131
aVWhen you look at copies like this,
p132
aVyou wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands
p133
aVremain in business?
p134
aVIf you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
p135
aVWell, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.
p136
aVWe invited Tom Ford to come \u2014
p137
aVthe conference was called, "Ready to Share:
p138
aVFashion and the Ownership of Creativity" \u2014
p139
aVand we asked him exactly this question.
p140
aVHere's what he had to say.
p141
aVHe had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,
p142
aVin case you didn't know.
p143
aa(lp144
VTom Ford: And we found after much research
p145
aVthat \u2014 actually not much research, quite simple research \u2014
p146
aVthat the counterfeit customer was not our customer.
p147
aa(lp148
VJohanna Blakley: Imagine that.
p149
aVThe people on Santee Alley
p150
aVare not the ones who shop at Gucci.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVThis is a very different demographic.
p153
aVAnd, you know, a knock-off is never the same
p154
aVas an original high-end design,
p155
aVat least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.
p156
aVBut even sometimes a cheaper version
p157
aVcan actually have some charming aspects,
p158
aVcan breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.
p159
aVThere's lots of virtues of copying.
p160
aVOne that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to
p161
aVis that we now have
p162
aVa much broader palette
p163
aVof design choices to choose from than we ever have before,
p164
aVand this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.
p165
aVAnd this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
p166
aa(lp167
VFashion, whether you like it or not,
p168
aVhelps you project who you are to the world.
p169
aVBecause of fast fashion,
p170
aVglobal trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.
p171
aVAnd this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;
p172
aVthey want trends to be set
p173
aVso that they can move product.
p174
aVFor fashionistas,
p175
aVthey want to stay ahead of the curve.
p176
aVThey don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.
p177
aVAnd so, they want to move on to the next trend
p178
aVas soon as possible.
p179
aa(lp180
VI tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.
p181
aVEvery season, these designers have to struggle
p182
aVto come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.
p183
aVAnd this, let me tell you,
p184
aVis very good for the bottom line.
p185
aVNow of course, there's a bunch of effects
p186
aVthat this culture of copying has
p187
aVon the creative process.
p188
aVAnd Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.
p189
aVHe has complained a lot about people copying him,
p190
aVbut in one interview I read,
p191
aVhe said it has really forced him to up his game.
p192
aVHe had to come up with new ideas,
p193
aVnew things that would be hard to copy.
p194
aVHe came up with this Bowden-wedge heel
p195
aVthat has to be made out of steel or titanium;
p196
aVif you make it from some sort of cheaper material,
p197
aVit'll actually crack in two.
p198
aVIt forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd that actually reminded me
p201
aVof jazz great, Charlie Parker.
p202
aVI don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.
p203
aVHe said that one of the reasons he invented bebop
p204
aVwas that he was pretty sure
p205
aVthat white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)
p206
aVHe wanted to make it too difficult to copy,
p207
aVand that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.
p208
aVThey're trying to put together
p209
aVa signature look, an aesthetic
p210
aVthat reflects who they are.
p211
aVWhen people knock it off, everybody knows
p212
aVbecause they've put that look out on the runway,
p213
aVand it's a coherent aesthetic.
p214
aa(lp215
VI love these Gallianos.
p216
aVOkay, we'll move on. (Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is not unlike the world of comedy.
p219
aVI don't know if you know that jokes
p220
aValso can't be copyright protected.
p221
aVSo when one-liners were really popular,
p222
aVeverybody stole them from one another.
p223
aVBut now, we have a different kind of comic.
p224
aVThey develop a persona,
p225
aVa signature style, much like fashion designers.
p226
aVAnd their jokes,
p227
aVmuch like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,
p228
aVreally only work within that aesthetic.
p229
aVIf somebody steals a joke
p230
aVfrom Larry David, for instance,
p231
aVit's not as funny.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, the other thing that fashion designers have done
p234
aVto survive in this culture of copying
p235
aVis they've learned how to copy themselves.
p236
aVThey knock themselves off.
p237
aVThey make deals with the fast fashion giants
p238
aVand they come up with a way to sell their product
p239
aVto a whole new demographic:
p240
aVthe Santee Alley demographic.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, some fashion designers will say,
p243
aV"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.
p244
aVIn other countries there is protection
p245
aVfor our artful designs."
p246
aVBut if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,
p247
aVit turns out that the protection that's offered
p248
aVis really ineffectual.
p249
aVIn Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,
p250
aVthey have a design law; it protects apparel,
p251
aVbut the novelty standard is so high,
p252
aVyou have to prove that your garment has never existed before,
p253
aVit's totally unique.
p254
aVAnd that's sort of like
p255
aVthe novelty standard for a U.S. patent,
p256
aVwhich fashion designers never get \u2014
p257
aVrarely get here in the states.
p258
aa(lp259
VIn the European Union, they went in the other direction.
p260
aVVery low novelty standard,
p261
aVanybody can register anything.
p262
aVBut even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry
p263
aVand you have a lot of luxury designers there,
p264
aVthey don't register their garments, generally,
p265
aVand there's not a lot of litigation.
p266
aVIt turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
p267
aVA person can come in and take somebody else's gown,
p268
aVcut off three inches from the bottom,
p269
aVgo to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.
p270
aVSo, that does not stop the knock-off artists.
p271
aVIf you look at the registry, actually,
p272
aVa lot of the registered things in the E.U.
p273
aVare Nike T-shirts
p274
aVthat are almost identical to one another.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.
p277
aVShe is the head of
p278
aVthe Council of Fashion Designers of America,
p279
aVand she has told her constituency that
p280
aVshe is going to get copyright protection
p281
aVfor fashion designs.
p282
aVThe retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.
p283
aVI don't think the legislation is going anywhere,
p284
aVbecause they realized it is so hard
p285
aVto tell the difference between a pirated design
p286
aVand something that's just part of a global trend.
p287
aVWho owns a look?
p288
aVThat is a very difficult question to answer.
p289
aVIt takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,
p290
aVand the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.
p291
aa(lp292
VYou know, it's not just the fashion industry
p293
aVthat doesn't have copyright protection.
p294
aVThere's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,
p295
aVincluding the food industry.
p296
aVYou cannot copyright a recipe
p297
aVbecause it's a set of instructions, it's fact,
p298
aVand you cannot copyright the look and feel
p299
aVof even the most unique dish.
p300
aVSame with automobiles.
p301
aVIt doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,
p302
aVyou cannot copyright the sculptural design.
p303
aVIt's a utilitarian article, that's why.
p304
aVSame with furniture,
p305
aVit's too utilitarian.
p306
aVMagic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:
p307
aVno copyright protection.
p308
aVHairdos, no copyright protection.
p309
aVOpen source software, these guys decided
p310
aVthey didn't want copyright protection.
p311
aVThey thought it'd be more innovative without it.
p312
aVIt's really hard to get copyright for databases.
p313
aVTattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
p314
aVThey share their designs.
p315
aVJokes, no copyright protection.
p316
aVFireworks displays,
p317
aVthe rules of games,
p318
aVthe smell of perfume: no.
p319
aVAnd some of these industries may seem
p320
aVsort of marginal to you,
p321
aVbut these are the gross sales
p322
aVfor low I.P. industries,
p323
aVindustries with very little copyright protection,
p324
aVand there's the gross sales of
p325
aVfilms and books.
p326
aV(Applause)
p327
aVIt ain't pretty.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VSo you talk to people in the fashion industry
p332
aVand they're like, "Shhh!
p333
aVDon't tell anybody
p334
aVwe can actually steal from each other's designs.
p335
aVIt's embarrassing."
p336
aVBut you know what? It's revolutionary,
p337
aVand it's a model that a lot of other industries \u2014
p338
aVlike the ones we just saw with the really small bars \u2014
p339
aVthey might have to think about this.
p340
aVBecause right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection
p341
aVare operating in an atmosphere
p342
aVwhere it's as if they don't have any protection,
p343
aVand they don't know what to do.
p344
aa(lp345
VWhen I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries
p346
aVthat didn't have copyright protection,
p347
aVI thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?
p348
aVI want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,
p349
aVso I made one.
p350
aVThese are the two main
p351
aVsort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.
p352
aVIt is more complex than this, but this will do.
p353
aVFirst: Is something an artistic object?
p354
aVThen it deserves protection.
p355
aVIs it a utilitarian object?
p356
aVThen no, it does not deserve protection.
p357
aVThis is a difficult, unstable binary.
p358
aa(lp359
VThe other one is: Is it an idea?
p360
aVIs it something that needs to
p361
aVfreely circulate in a free society?
p362
aVNo protection.
p363
aVOr is it a physically fixed
p364
aVexpression of an idea:
p365
aVsomething that somebody made
p366
aVand they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?
p367
aVThe problem is that digital technology
p368
aVhas completely subverted the logic
p369
aVof this physically fixed, expression
p370
aVversus idea concept.
p371
aVNowadays,
p372
aVwe don't really recognize a book
p373
aVas something that sits on our shelf
p374
aVor music as something that is
p375
aVa physical object that we can hold.
p376
aVIt's a digital file.
p377
aVIt is barely tethered to any sort of
p378
aVphysical reality in our minds.
p379
aVAnd these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,
p380
aVactually circulate within our culture
p381
aVa lot more like ideas
p382
aVthan like physically instantiated objects.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow, the conceptual issues are truly profound
p385
aVwhen you talk about creativity
p386
aVand ownership
p387
aVand, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.
p388
aVThey're smart.
p389
aVI'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.
p390
aVHe's smart, he's smart.
p391
aVBut you want an interdisciplinary team of people
p392
aVhashing this out,
p393
aVtrying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,
p394
aVin a digital world,
p395
aVthat's going to lead to the most innovation?
p396
aVAnd my suggestion is that
p397
aVfashion might be a really good place
p398
aVto start looking for a model
p399
aVfor creative industries in the future.
