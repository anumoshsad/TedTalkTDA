VSo I've been thinking about the difference between
p4
aVthe résumé virtues and  the eulogy virtues.
p5
aVThe résumé virtues are the ones you put on your résumé,
p6
aVwhich are the skills  you bring to the marketplace.
p7
aVThe eulogy virtues are the ones
p8
aVthat get mentioned in the eulogy,
p9
aVwhich are deeper: who are you,  in your depth,
p10
aVwhat is the nature of your relationships,
p11
aVare you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?
p12
aVAnd most of us, including  me, would say
p13
aVthat the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues.
p14
aVBut at least in my case,  are they the ones that
p15
aVI think about the most?  And the answer is no.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I've been thinking about that problem,
p18
aVand a thinker who has  helped me think about it
p19
aVis a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi
p20
aVwho wrote a book called "The Lonely Man Of Faith" in 1965.
p21
aVSoloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,
p22
aVwhich he called Adam I and Adam II.
p23
aVAdam I is the worldly, ambitious,
p24
aVexternal side of our nature.
p25
aVHe wants to build, create, create companies,
p26
aVcreate innovation.
p27
aVAdam II is the humble side of our nature.
p28
aVAdam II wants not only  to do good but to be good,
p29
aVto live in a way internally
p30
aVthat honors God, creation and our possibilities.
p31
aVAdam I wants to conquer the world.
p32
aVAdam II wants to hear  a calling and obey the world.
p33
aVAdam I savors accomplishment.
p34
aVAdam II savors inner  consistency and strength.
p35
aVAdam I asks how things work.
p36
aVAdam II asks why we're here.
p37
aVAdam I's motto is "success."
p38
aVAdam II's motto is "love, redemption and return."
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd Soloveitchik argued  that these two sides
p41
aVof our nature are  at war with each other.
p42
aVWe live in perpetual self-confrontation
p43
aVbetween the external success and the internal value.
p44
aVAnd the tricky thing,  I'd say, about these
p45
aVtwo sides of our nature is they work
p46
aVby different logics.
p47
aVThe external logic is  an economic logic:
p48
aVinput leads to output,  risk leads to reward.
p49
aVThe internal side of our nature
p50
aVis a moral logic and  often an inverse logic.
p51
aVYou have to give to receive.
p52
aVYou have to surrender  to something outside yourself
p53
aVto gain strength within yourself.
p54
aVYou have to conquer the desire to get what you want.
p55
aVIn order to fulfill yourself, you have to forget yourself.
p56
aVIn order to find yourself,  you have to lose yourself.
p57
aa(lp58
VWe happen to live in a society  that favors Adam I,
p59
aVand often neglects Adam II.
p60
aVAnd the problem is, that turns you into a shrewd animal
p61
aVwho treats life as a game,
p62
aVand you become a cold,  calculating creature
p63
aVwho slips into a sort of mediocrity
p64
aVwhere you realize there's a difference
p65
aVbetween your desired  self and your actual self.
p66
aVYou're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,
p67
aVyou hope someone will give to you.
p68
aVYou don't have the  depth of conviction.
p69
aVYou don't have an emotional sonorousness.
p70
aVYou don't have  commitment to tasks
p71
aVthat would take more than a lifetime to commit.
p72
aa(lp73
VI was reminded of a common response through history
p74
aVof how you build a solid Adam II,
p75
aVhow you build a depth of character.
p76
aVThrough history, people  have gone back
p77
aVinto their own pasts,
p78
aVsometimes to a precious  time in their life,
p79
aVto their childhood,
p80
aVand often, the mind  gravitates in the past
p81
aVto a moment of shame,
p82
aVsome sin committed,  some act of selfishness,
p83
aVan act of omission, of shallowness,
p84
aVthe sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,
p85
aVtrying to be a people-pleaser,  a lack of courage.
p86
aVAdam I is built by  building on your strengths.
p87
aVAdam II is built by fighting  your weaknesses.
p88
aVYou go into yourself,  you find the sin
p89
aVwhich you've committed over and again through your life,
p90
aVyour signature sin
p91
aVout of which the others emerge,
p92
aVand you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,
p93
aVand out of that wrestling,  that suffering,
p94
aVthen a depth of character is constructed.
p95
aVAnd we're often not taught to recognize
p96
aVthe sin in ourselves,
p97
aVin that we're not taught in this culture
p98
aVhow to wrestle with it,
p99
aVhow to confront it,  and how to combat it.
p100
aVWe live in a culture  with an Adam I mentality
p101
aVwhere we're inarticulate  about Adam II.
p102
aa(lp103
VFinally, Reinhold Niebuhr
p104
aVsummed up the confrontation, the fully lived
p105
aVAdam I and Adam II life, this way:
p106
aV"Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime;
p107
aVtherefore we must  be saved by hope.
p108
aVNothing which is true or beautiful or good makes
p109
aVcomplete sense in any immediate context of history;
p110
aVtherefore we must be saved by faith.
p111
aVNothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;
p112
aVtherefore we must  be saved by love.
p113
aVNo virtuous act is quite as virtuous
p114
aVfrom the standpoint of our friend or foe as from our own standpoint.
p115
aVTherefore we must be saved  by that final form of love,
p116
aVwhich is forgiveness.\u201d
