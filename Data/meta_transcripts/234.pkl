(lp3
VWell, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be
p4
aVin the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.
p5
aVAnd I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life
p8
aVthe last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.
p9
aVAfter I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.
p10
aVI thought that was it.
p11
aVAnd for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.
p12
aVAnd I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.
p13
aVBut then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,
p14
aVone after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter)
p15
aVI said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.
p18
aVThis went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.
p19
aVAnd so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.
p20
aVBut I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.
p21
aVAnd there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:
p22
aVJudaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.
p23
aVAnd while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all \u2014
p24
aVdespite my own intensely religious background,
p25
aVI'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,
p26
aVand I knew nothing about Islam at all.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut in that city, that tortured city,
p29
aVwhere you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,
p30
aVyou also become aware of the profound connection between them.
p31
aVAnd it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back
p32
aVto a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me
p33
aVto look at my own faith in a different light.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I found some astonishing things in the course of my study
p36
aVthat had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,
p37
aVI just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.
p38
aVThese doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.
p39
aVAnd to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,
p40
aVI began to realize that belief \u2014 which we make such a fuss about today \u2014
p41
aVis only a very recent religious enthusiasm
p42
aVthat surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.
p43
aVThe word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.
p44
aVIn the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,
p45
aVfor reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,
p46
aVto include \u2014 to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.
p47
aV"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
p48
aVIt meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."
p49
aVIndeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.
p50
aVIn the Quran, religious opinion \u2014 religious orthodoxy \u2014 is dismissed as "zanna:"
p51
aVself-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,
p52
aVbut which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?
p55
aVWhat I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.
p56
aVInstead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.
p57
aVYou behave in a committed way,
p58
aVand then you begin to understand the truths of religion.
p59
aVAnd religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;
p60
aVyou only understand them when you put them into practice.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.
p63
aVAnd it is an arresting fact that right across the board,
p64
aVin every single one of the major world faiths, compassion \u2014
p65
aVthe ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening \u2014
p66
aVis not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us
p67
aVinto the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."
p68
aVIt is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.
p69
aVWhy? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,
p70
aVwe dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put
p71
aVanother person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted \u2014 has said \u2014
p74
aVand put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.
p75
aVFirst propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:
p76
aV"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
p77
aVThat, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching
p78
aVand that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.
p79
aVAnd it was \u2014 the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,"
p80
aVhuman-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.
p83
aVThere's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.
p84
aVA pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could
p85
aVrecite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.
p86
aVHillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,
p87
aVdo not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.
p88
aVGo and study it." (Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd "go and study it" was what he meant.
p91
aVHe said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear
p92
aVthat every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."
p93
aVThe great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which
p94
aVled to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people \u2014
p95
aVany people whatsoever \u2014 was illegitimate.
p96
aa(lp97
VSaint Augustine made exactly the same point.
p98
aVScripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave
p99
aVan interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."
p100
aVAnd this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts
p101
aVis a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VBut now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is \u2014
p104
aVwhere religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.
p105
aVWhere instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.
p106
aVDon't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,
p107
aVendlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,
p108
aVputting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,
p109
aVand this is because of human ego, human greed.
p110
aVWe have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo the traditions also insisted \u2014 and this is an important point, I think \u2014
p113
aVthat you could not and must not confine your compassion
p114
aVto your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,
p115
aVyour own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":
p116
aVconcern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.
p117
aVWe formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd this, again \u2014 this universal outreach \u2014 is getting subdued in the strident use of religion \u2014
p120
aVabuse of religion \u2014 for nefarious gains.
p121
aVNow, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,
p122
aVwhen I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion
p123
aVhas been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.
p124
aVThe causes of our present woes are political.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line,
p127
aVand when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in
p128
aVand become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.
p129
aVBetween 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.
p130
aVAnd so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,
p131
aVnow causes riots where people even die.
p132
aVAnd it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.
p133
aa(lp134
VThere's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.
p135
aVPeople seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.
p136
aVAs though that \u2014 we call religious people often believers,
p137
aVas though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals
p138
aVget pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.
p139
aVBecause the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes \u2014 when I'm speaking to
p140
aVcongregations about compassion, I sometimes see
p141
aVa mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because
p142
aVa lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VNow \u2014 but that's not the whole story.
p145
aVSince September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me
p146
aVinto public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,
p147
aVand finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.
p148
aVI've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,
p149
aVbecause they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.
p150
aVAnd especially the young people were coming. And were asking me \u2014
p151
aVthe young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"
p152
aVAnd my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.
p153
aVTell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
p154
aa(lp155
VBecause it seems to me that with \u2014 our current situation is so serious
p156
aVat the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding
p157
aVand global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.
p158
aVAnd religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,
p159
aVpeople may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown \u2014
p160
aVbut they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,
p161
aVwhich is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut people want to be religious, and religion should be made
p164
aVto be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be \u2014
p165
aVbecause of the Golden Rule.
p166
aV"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":
p167
aVan ethos that should now be applied globally.
p168
aVWe should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd these \u2014 whatever our wretched beliefs \u2014 is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.
p171
aVIt's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.
p172
aVAnd as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.
p173
aVHere in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.
p174
aVAnd people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,
p175
aVcoming together locally to create networks of understanding.
p176
aVWith the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."
p177
aVI think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.
p178
aa(lp179
VI'd \u2014 there's one story I'd just like to mention.
p180
aVThis comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.
p181
aVYou know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.
p182
aVIn one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,
p183
aVand the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,
p184
aVhis beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed \u2014 and killed in single combat
p185
aVby one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,
p186
aVand he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body
p187
aVand then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,
p188
aVwhich means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.
p189
aVAnd then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,
p190
aVcomes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent
p191
aVto ask for the body of his son.
p192
aVAnd everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.
p193
aVAnd Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.
p194
aVAnd Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons,
p195
aVand he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.
p196
aVThe Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.
p197
aVAnd then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father,
p198
aVand the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.
p199
aa(lp200
VThat is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.
p201
aVIt's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies,
p202
aVand beginning to appreciate the other.
p203
aVIt's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.
p204
aVAnd it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can
p205
aVgive us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd now, here's my wish:
p208
aVI wish that you would help with the creation,
p209
aVlaunch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion,
p210
aVcrafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from
p211
aVthe three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,
p212
aVand based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.
p213
aVWe need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels \u2014
p214
aVyou probably meet, too \u2014 who want to join up, in some way,
p215
aVand reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.
p216
aVWe need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos,
p217
aVand to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.
p218
aVI'd like to see it \u2014 to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures,
p219
aVthese texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine
p220
aVsaid about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.
p221
aVLet's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims \u2014
p222
aVthese traditions now so often at loggerheads \u2014 working together to
p223
aVcreate a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,
p224
aVof major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.
p227
aVDespite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me
p228
aV\u2014 I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very \u2014
p229
aVyou're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,
p230
aVeverybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks,
p231
aVand Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example,
p232
aVis very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.
p233
aVAlso, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.
p234
aVI was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations,
p235
aVwhich was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism,
p236
aVand to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.
p239
aVThe importance of this is that this is \u2014 I can see some of you starting to look worried,
p240
aVbecause you think it's a slow and cumbersome body \u2014
p241
aVbut what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality,
p242
aVso that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming,
p243
aVas it were, from the United Nations, from the world \u2014
p244
aVwho would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd so I do urge you to join me in making \u2014 in this charter \u2014
p247
aVto building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes \u2014
p248
aVI'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world,
p249
aVso that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world,
p250
aVwhich it can and should be. Thank you very much. (Applause)
