VEvery group of female friends has the funny one,
p4
aVthe one you go to when you need a good cry,
p5
aVthe one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day.
p6
aVAnd this group was no different.
p7
aVExcept that this was a community of groundbreaking women
p8
aVwho came together \u2014
p9
aVfirst to become teammates, then friends, and then family \u2014
p10
aVin the least likely of places:
p11
aVon the Special Operations battlefield.
p12
aVThis was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented
p13
aVnot only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear,
p14
aVbut by the fact that they were there
p15
aVat a time when women \u2014 officially, at least \u2014
p16
aVremained banned from ground combat,
p17
aVand America had no idea they existed.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis story begins with Special Operations leaders,
p20
aVsome of the most tested men in the United States military, saying,
p21
aV"We need women to help us wage this war."
p22
aV"America would never kill its way to the end of its wars," it argued.
p23
aV"Needed more knowledge and more understanding."
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd as everyone knows,
p26
aVif you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home,
p27
aVyou talk to women,
p28
aVwhether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan,
p29
aVor Southern California.
p30
aVBut in this case, men could not talk to women,
p31
aVbecause in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan,
p32
aVthat would cause grave offense.
p33
aVSo you needed women soldiers out there.
p34
aVThat meant, at this time in the war, that the women who would be recruited
p35
aVto serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs,
p36
aVwould be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent
p37
aVof the entire United States military.
p38
aVLess than five percent.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo the call went out.
p41
aV"Female soldiers: Become a part of history.
p42
aVJoin Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan."
p43
aVThis is in 2011.
p44
aVAnd from Alabama to Alaska,
p45
aVa group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered
p46
aValongside the best of the best,
p47
aVand to make a difference for their country,
p48
aVanswered that call to serve.
p49
aVAnd for them it was not about politics, it was about serving with purpose.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd so, the women who came to North Carolina
p52
aVto compete for a spot on these teams
p53
aVwhich would put women on the Special Operations front lines,
p54
aVlanded and found very quickly a community,
p55
aVthe likes of which they had never seen.
p56
aVFull of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were,
p57
aVand as driven to make a difference.
p58
aVThey didn't have to apologize for who they were,
p59
aVand in fact, they could celebrate it.
p60
aVAnd what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden,
p61
aVthere were lots of people like them.
p62
aVAs one of them said,
p63
aV"It was like you looked around and realized
p64
aVthere was more than one giraffe at the zoo."
p65
aa(lp66
VAmong this team of standouts was Cassie,
p67
aVa young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister
p68
aVand a Women's Studies minor, all in one person.
p69
aVTristan, a West Point track star, who always ran and road marched
p70
aVwith no socks,
p71
aVand had shoes whose smell proved it.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVAmber, a Heidi look-alike, who had always wanted to be in the infantry,
p74
aVand when she found out that women couldn't be,
p75
aVshe decided to become an intel officer.
p76
aVShe served in Bosnia,
p77
aVand later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.
p78
aVAnd then there was Kate, who played high school football
p79
aVall four years,
p80
aVand actually wanted to drop out after the first,
p81
aVto go into the glee club,
p82
aVbut when boys told her that girls couldn't play football,
p83
aVshe decided to stay
p84
aVfor all the little girls who would come after her.
p85
aa(lp86
VFor them, biology had shaped part of their destiny,
p87
aVand put, as Cassie once said,
p88
aV"everything noble out of reach for girls."
p89
aVAnd yet, here was a chance to serve with the best of the best
p90
aVon a mission that mattered to their country,
p91
aVnot despite the fact that they were female,
p92
aVbut because of it.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis team of women, in many ways, was like women everywhere.
p95
aVThey wore makeup, and in fact,
p96
aVthey would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil.
p97
aVThey also wore body armor.
p98
aVThey would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs,
p99
aVand board the helicopter for an operation,
p100
aVand they would come back and watch a movie called "Bridesmaids."
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVThey even wore a thing called Spanx,
p103
aVbecause, as they found very quickly,
p104
aVthe uniforms made for men were big where they should be small,
p105
aVand small where they should be big.
p106
aVSo Lane, an Iraq War veteran \u2014 you see her here on my left \u2014
p107
aVdecided she was going to go on Amazon
p108
aVand order a pair of Spanx to her base,
p109
aVso that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night.
p110
aa(lp111
VThese women would get together over video conference
p112
aVfrom all around Afghanistan from their various bases,
p113
aVand they would talk about what it was like
p114
aVto be one of the only women doing what they were doing.
p115
aVThey would swap jokes,
p116
aVthey would talk about what was working, what wasn't,
p117
aVwhat they had learned to do well, what they needed to do better.
p118
aVAnd they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women
p119
aVout on the Special Operations front lines,
p120
aVincluding the Shewee,
p121
aVwhich was a tool that let you pee like a guy,
p122
aValthough it's said to have had only a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VThese women lived in the "and."
p126
aVThey proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine.
p127
aVYou could wear mascara and body armor.
p128
aVYou could love CrossFit, and really like cross-stitch.
p129
aVYou could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies.
p130
aVWomen live in the and every single day,
p131
aVand these women brought that to this mission as well.
p132
aVOn this life and death battlefield they never forgot
p133
aVthat being female may have brought them to the front lines,
p134
aVbut being a soldier is what would prove themselves there.
p135
aa(lp136
VThere was the night Amber went out on mission,
p137
aVand in talking to the women of the house,
p138
aVrealized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait
p139
aVfor the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home.
p140
aVAnother night it was Tristan who found out
p141
aVthat there were pieces that make up explosives
p142
aVall around the house in which they were standing,
p143
aVand that in fact, explosives lay all the way between there
p144
aVand where they were about to head that night.
p145
aVThere was the night another one of their teammates proved herself
p146
aVto a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,
p147
aVwhen she found the intel item they were looking for
p148
aVwrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.
p149
aVAnd there was the night that Isabel, another one of their teammates,
p150
aVfound the things that they were looking for,
p151
aVand received an Impact Award from the Rangers
p152
aVwho said that without her,
p153
aVthe things and the people they were looking for that night
p154
aVwould never have been found.
p155
aa(lp156
VThat night and so many others,
p157
aVthey went out to prove themselves, not only for one another,
p158
aVbut for everybody who would come after them.
p159
aVAnd also for the men alongside whom they served.
p160
aVWe talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman.
p161
aVAnd in this case,
p162
aVnext to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed.
p163
aVThe Army Ranger who trained them had served 12 deployments.
p164
aVAnd when they told him that he had to go train girls,
p165
aVhe had no idea what to expect.
p166
aVBut at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011,
p167
aVhe told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history.
p168
aVThese may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen."
p169
aV(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VAt the heart of this team was the one person
p172
aVwho everyone called "the best of us."
p173
aVShe was a petite blonde dynamo,
p174
aVwho barely reached five-foot-three.
p175
aVAnd she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart,
p176
aVand what we know as G.I. Jane.
p177
aVShe was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband,
p178
aVher Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best,
p179
aVand to trust herself,
p180
aVand to test every limit she could.
p181
aVShe also loved to put 50 pounds of weight on her back and run for miles,
p182
aVand she loved to be a soldier.
p183
aVShe was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar,
p184
aVand would bake a batch of raisin bread, and then go to the gym
p185
aVand bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups from a dead hang.
p186
aVShe was the person who, if you needed an extra pair of boots
p187
aVor a home-cooked dinner, would be on your speed dial.
p188
aVBecause she never, ever would talk to you
p189
aVabout how good she was,
p190
aVbut let her character speak through action.
p191
aVShe was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong.
p192
aVAnd she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope,
p193
aVclimbing it using only her arms,
p194
aVand then shuffling away and apologizing,
p195
aVbecause she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs,
p196
aVas the Rangers had trained them.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VSome of our heroes return home to tell their stories.
p200
aVAnd some of them don't.
p201
aVAnd on October 22, 2011,
p202
aVFirst Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers,
p203
aVChristopher Horns
p204
aVand Kristoffer Domeij.
p205
aVHer death threw this program built for the shadows
p206
aVinto a very public spotlight.
p207
aVBecause after all,
p208
aVthe ban on women in combat was still very much in place.
p209
aVAnd at her funeral,
p210
aVthe head of Army Special Operations came, and gave a public testimony
p211
aVnot just to the courage of Ashley White,
p212
aVbut to all her team of sisters.
p213
aV"Make no mistake about it," he said, "these women are warriors,
p214
aVand they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female
p215
aVin the United States Army."
p216
aa(lp217
VAshley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver,
p218
aVwho bakes cookies on the side.
p219
aVShe doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days,
p220
aVin which grief \u2014 enormous grief \u2014
p221
aVmixed with pride.
p222
aVBut she does remember one moment.
p223
aVA stranger with a child in her hand came up to her
p224
aVand she said, "Mrs. White,
p225
aVI brought my daughter here today,
p226
aVbecause I wanted her to know what a hero was.
p227
aVAnd I wanted her to know that heroes could be women, too."
p228
aa(lp229
VIt is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines
p230
aVwho reach into their guts
p231
aVand find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit.
p232
aVThis very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward
p233
aVdid indeed become part of history,
p234
aVand they paved the way for so many who would come after them,
p235
aVas much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before.
p236
aVThese women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes.
p237
aVAnd women can be heroes, too.
p238
aVThank you so much.
