VAll right, let's get up our picture of the earth.
p4
aVThe earth is pretty awesome.
p5
aVI'm a geologist, so I get pretty psyched about this,
p6
aVbut the earth is great.
p7
aVIt's powerful, it's dynamic, it's constantly changing.
p8
aVIt's a pretty exciting place to live.
p9
aVBut I want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist
p10
aVin how understanding earth's past
p11
aVcan help inform and guide decisions that we make today
p12
aVabout how to sustainably live on earth's surface.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo there's a lot of exciting things that go on on the surface of the earth.
p15
aVIf we zoom in here a little bit,
p16
aVI want to talk to you guys a little bit about one of the things that happens.
p17
aVMaterial get shuffled around earth's surface all the time,
p18
aVand one of the big thing that happens is material from high mountains
p19
aVgets eroded and transported and deposited in the sea.
p20
aVAnd this process is ongoing all the time,
p21
aVand it has huge effects on how the landscape works.
p22
aVSo this example here in south India \u2014
p23
aVwe have some of the biggest mountains in the world,
p24
aVand you can see in this satellite photo
p25
aVrivers transporting material from those mountains out to the sea.
p26
aVYou can think of these rivers like bulldozers.
p27
aVThey're basically taking these mountains and pushing them down towards the sea.
p28
aa(lp29
VWe'll give you guys an example here.
p30
aVSo we zoom in a little bit.
p31
aVI want to talk to you guys specifically about a river.
p32
aVWe can see these beautiful patterns that the rivers make
p33
aVas they're pushing material down to the sea,
p34
aVbut these patterns aren't static.
p35
aVThese rivers are wiggling and jumping around quite a bit,
p36
aVand it can have big impacts on our lives.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo an example of this is this is the Kosi River.
p39
aVSo the Kosi River has this nice c-shaped pathway,
p40
aVand it exits the big mountains of Nepal
p41
aVcarrying with it a ton of material,
p42
aVa lot of sediments that's being eroded from the high mountains,
p43
aVand it spreads out across India
p44
aVand moves this material.
p45
aVSo we're going to zoom in to this area
p46
aVand I'm going to tell you a little bit about what happened with the Kosi.
p47
aVIt's an example of how dynamic these systems can be.
p48
aVSo this is a satellite image from August of 2008,
p49
aVand this satellite image is colored
p50
aVso that vegetations or plants show up as green
p51
aVand water shows up as blue.
p52
aVSo here again you can see that c-shaped pathway
p53
aVthat this river takes as it exits Nepal.
p54
aVAnd now this is monsoon season.
p55
aVAugust is monsoon season in this region of the world,
p56
aVand anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding
p57
aVand the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that.
p58
aVBut something interesting happened in 2008,
p59
aVand this river moved in a way that's very different.
p60
aVIt flooded in a way that's very different than it normally does.
p61
aVSo the Kosi River is flowing down here,
p62
aVbut sometimes as these rivers are bulldozing sediment,
p63
aVthey kind of get clogged,
p64
aVand these clogs can actually cause the rivers
p65
aVto shift their course dramatically.
p66
aVSo this satellite image is from just two weeks later.
p67
aVHere's the previous pathway,
p68
aVthat c-shaped pathway,
p69
aVand you notice it's not blue anymore.
p70
aVBut now what we have is this blue pathway
p71
aVthat cuts down the middle of the field of view here.
p72
aVWhat happened is the Kosi River jumped its banks,
p73
aVand for reference, the scale bar here is 40 miles.
p74
aVThis river moved over 30 miles very abruptly.
p75
aVSo this river got clogged and it jumped its banks.
p76
aVHere's an image from about a week later,
p77
aVand you can see these are the previous pathways,
p78
aVand you can see this process of river-jumping continues
p79
aVas this river moves farther away from its major course.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo you can imagine in landscapes like this,
p82
aVwhere rivers move around frequently,
p83
aVit's really important to understand when, where and how they're going to jump.
p84
aVBut these kinds of processes also happen a lot closer to home as well.
p85
aVSo in the United States,
p86
aVwe have the Mississippi River that drains most of the continental US.
p87
aVIt pushes material from the Rocky Mountains
p88
aVand from the Great Plains.
p89
aVIt drains it and moves it all the way across America
p90
aVand dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.
p91
aVSo this is the course of the Mississippi that we're familiar with today,
p92
aVbut it didn't always flow in this direction.
p93
aVIf we use the geologic record,
p94
aVwe can reconstruct where it went in the past.
p95
aVSo for example, this red area here
p96
aVis where we know the Mississippi River flowed and deposited material
p97
aVabout 4,600 years ago.
p98
aVThen about 3,500 years ago it moved
p99
aVto follow the course outlined here in orange.
p100
aVAnd it kept moving and it keeps moving.
p101
aVSo here's about 2,000 years ago,
p102
aVa thousand years ago,
p103
aV700 years ago.
p104
aVAnd it was only as recently as 500 years ago
p105
aVthat it occupied the pathway that we're familiar with today.
p106
aVSo these processes are really important,
p107
aVand especially here, this delta area,
p108
aVwhere these river-jumping events in the Mississippi
p109
aVare building land at the interface of the land and the sea.
p110
aVThis is really valuable real estate,
p111
aVand deltas like this are some of the most densely populated areas on our planet.
p112
aVSo understanding the dynamics of these landscapes,
p113
aVhow they formed and how they will continue to change in the future
p114
aVis really important for the people that live there.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo rivers also wiggle.
p117
aVThese are sort of bigger jumps that we've been talking about.
p118
aVI want to show you guys some river wiggles here.
p119
aVSo we're going to fly down to the Amazon River basin,
p120
aVand here again we have a big river system
p121
aVthat is draining and moving and plowing material from the Andean Mountains,
p122
aVtransporting it across South America
p123
aVand dumping it out into the Atlantic Ocean.
p124
aVSo if we zoom in here, you guys can see these nice, curvy river pathways.
p125
aVAgain, they're really beautiful, but again, they're not static.
p126
aVThese rivers wiggle around.
p127
aVWe can use satellite imagery over the last 30 or so years
p128
aVto actually monitor how these change.
p129
aVSo take a minute and just watch any bend or curve in this river,
p130
aVand you'll see it doesn't stay in the same place for very long.
p131
aVIt changes and evolves and warps its pattern.
p132
aVIf you look in this area in particular,
p133
aVI want you guys to notice there's a sort of a loop in the river
p134
aVthat gets completely cut off.
p135
aVIt's almost like a whip cracking
p136
aVand snaps off the pathway of the river at a certain spot.
p137
aVSo just for reference, again,
p138
aVin this location, that river changed its course over four miles
p139
aVover the course of a season or two.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo the landscapes that we live in on earth,
p142
aVas this material is being eroded from the mountains
p143
aVand transported to the sea,
p144
aVare wiggling around all the time.
p145
aVThey're changing all the time,
p146
aVand we need to be able to understand these processes
p147
aVso we can manage and live sustainably on these landscapes.
p148
aVBut it's hard to do if the only information we have
p149
aVis what's going on today at earth's surface.
p150
aVRight? We don't have a lot of observations.
p151
aVWe only have 30 years' worth of satellite photos, for example.
p152
aVWe need more observations to understand these processes more.
p153
aVAnd additionally, we need to know
p154
aVhow these landscapes are going to respond to changing climate
p155
aVand to changing land use
p156
aVas we continue to occupy and modify earth's surface.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo this is where the rocks come in.
p159
aVSo as rivers flow,
p160
aVas they're bulldozing material from the mountains to the sea,
p161
aVsometimes bits of sand and clay and rock get stuck in the ground.
p162
aVAnd that stuff that gets stuck in the ground gets buried,
p163
aVand through time, we get big, thick accumulations of sediments
p164
aVthat eventually turn into rocks.
p165
aVWhat this means is that we can go to places like this,
p166
aVwhere we see big, thick stacks of sedimentary rocks,
p167
aVand go back in time
p168
aVand see what the landscapes looked like in the past.
p169
aVWe can do this to help reconstruct
p170
aVand understand how earth landscapes evolve.
p171
aVThis is pretty convenient, too,
p172
aVbecause the earth has had sort of an epic history. Right?
p173
aVSo this video here is a reconstruction of paleogeography
p174
aVfor just the first 600 million years of earth's history.
p175
aVSo just a little bit of time here.
p176
aVSo as the plates move around,
p177
aVwe know climate has changed, sea level has changed,
p178
aVwe have a lot of different types of landscapes
p179
aVand different types of environments that we can go back \u2014
p180
aVif we have a time machine \u2014
p181
aVwe can go back and look at,
p182
aVand we do indeed have a time machine
p183
aVbecause we can look at the rocks that were deposited at these times.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo I'm going to give you an example of this
p186
aVand take you to a special time in earth's past.
p187
aVAbout 55 million years ago, there was a really abrupt warming event,
p188
aVand what happened was a whole bunch of carbon dioxide
p189
aVwas released into earth's atmosphere,
p190
aVand it caused a rapid and pretty extreme global warming event.
p191
aVAnd when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,
p192
aVthat there were things like crocodiles and palm trees
p193
aVas far north as Canada and as far south as Patagonia.
p194
aVSo this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly.
p195
aVSo what we can do
p196
aVis we can go back and find rocks that were deposited at this time
p197
aVand reconstruct how the landscape changed in response to this warming event.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo here, yay, rocks.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VHere's a pile of rocks.
p204
aVThis yellow blob here,
p205
aVthis is actually a fossil river,
p206
aVso just like this cartoon I showed,
p207
aVthese are deposits that were laid down 55 million years ago.
p208
aVAs geologists, we can go and look at these up close
p209
aVand reconstruct the landscape.
p210
aVSo here's another example.
p211
aVThe yellow blob here is a fossil river.
p212
aVHere's another one above it.
p213
aVWe can go and look in detail and make measurements and observations,
p214
aVand we can measure features.
p215
aVFor example, the features I just highlighted there
p216
aVtell us that this particular river was probably about three feet deep.
p217
aVYou could wade across this cute little stream
p218
aVif you were walking around 55 million years ago.
p219
aVThe reddish stuff that's above and below those channels,
p220
aVthose are ancient soil deposits.
p221
aVSo we can look at those to tell us what lived and grew on the landscape
p222
aVand to understand how these rivers were interacting with their floodplains.
p223
aVSo we can look in detail and reconstruct with some specificity
p224
aVhow these rivers flowed and what the landscapes looked like.
p225
aVSo when we do this for this particular place
p226
aVat this time,
p227
aVif we look what happened before this abrupt warming event,
p228
aVthe rivers kind of carved their way down from the mountains to the sea,
p229
aVand they looked maybe similar to what I showed you in the Amazon River basin.
p230
aVBut right at the onset of this climate change event,
p231
aVthe rivers change dramatically.
p232
aVAll of a sudden they got much broader,
p233
aVand they started to slide back and forth across the landscape more readily.
p234
aVEventually, the rivers reverted back to a state that was more similar
p235
aVto what they would have looked like before this climate event,
p236
aVbut it took a long, long time.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo we can go back in earth's time and do these kinds of reconstructions
p239
aVand understand how earth's landscape has changed
p240
aVin response to a climate event like this or a land use event.
p241
aVSo some of the ways that rivers change
p242
aVor the reasons that rivers change their pattern and their movements
p243
aVis because of things like with extra water falling on the land's surface
p244
aVwhen climate is hotter,
p245
aVwe can move more sediment and erode more sediment,
p246
aVand that changes how rivers behave.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo ultimately,
p249
aVas long as earth's surface is our home,
p250
aVwe need to carefully manage the resources and risks
p251
aVassociated with living in dynamic environments.
p252
aVAnd I think the only way we can really do that sustainably
p253
aVis if we include information
p254
aVabout how landscapes evolved and behaved in earth's past.
