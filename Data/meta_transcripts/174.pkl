VAs an architect you design for the present,
p4
aVwith an awareness of the past,
p5
aVfor a future which is essentially unknown.
p6
aVThe green agenda is probably the most important agenda
p7
aVand issue of the day.
p8
aVAnd I'd like to share some experience
p9
aVover the last 40 years \u2014 we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year \u2014
p10
aVand to explore and to touch on some observations
p11
aVabout the nature of sustainability.
p12
aVHow far you can anticipate, what follows from it,
p13
aVwhat are the threats, what are the possibilities,
p14
aVthe challenges, the opportunities?
p15
aVI think that \u2014 I've said in the past, many, many years ago,
p16
aVbefore anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,
p17
aVthat it wasn't about fashion \u2014 it was about survival.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,
p20
aVthat really, green is cool.
p21
aVI mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired
p22
aVby that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,
p23
aVin a way celebrating the places and the spaces
p24
aVwhich determine the quality of life.
p25
aVI rarely actually quote anything,
p26
aVso I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,
p27
aV[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought
p28
aVabout what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,
p29
aVanalyst, writer \u2014 a guy called Thomas Friedman,
p30
aVwho wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
p31
aVHe said,
p32
aV"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006
p33
aVwas that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
p34
aVWe reached a tipping point this year
p35
aVwhere living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green
p36
aVcame to be understood by a critical mass
p37
aVof citizens, entrepreneurs and officials
p38
aVas the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political
p39
aVand competitive thing they could do.
p40
aVHence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I asked myself, in a way, looking back,
p43
aV"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?"
p44
aVAnd I think it was July 20, 1969,
p45
aVwhen, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
p46
aVAnd, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
p47
aVAnd before the kind of collapse of the communist system,
p48
aVI was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts
p49
aVin Space City and other places in Russia.
p50
aVAnd interestingly, as I think back,
p51
aVthey were the first true environmentalists.
p52
aVThey were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,
p53
aVfired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
p54
aVAnd at that period it was \u2014
p55
aVin a way, a number of things were happening.
p56
aVBuckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru \u2014
p57
aVagain, a word that had not been coined.
p58
aVHe was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,
p59
aVbut he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
p60
aVIt's another subject. It's another conversation.
p61
aVYou can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
p62
aVIt was at that time, with an awareness
p63
aVfired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns
p64
aVas a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,
p65
aVthat influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd it's a number of projects.
p68
aVI select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan
p69
aVfor one of the Canary Islands.
p70
aVAnd this probably coincided with the time
p71
aVwhen you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,
p72
aVand you had the hippie movement.
p73
aVAnd there are some of those qualities in this drawing,
p74
aVwhich seeks to sum up the recommendations.
p75
aVAnd all the components are there which are now
p76
aVin common parlance, in our vocabulary,
p77
aVyou know, 30-odd years later:
p78
aVwind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
p79
aVAnd in parallel at that time, there was
p80
aVa very kind of exclusive design club.
p81
aVPeople who were really design conscious
p82
aVwere inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,
p83
aVand the objects that he would create
p84
aVfor the company called Braun.
p85
aVThis is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
p86
aVAnd despite Bucky's prophecies
p87
aVthat everything would be miniaturized
p88
aVand technology would make an incredible style \u2014
p89
aVaccess to comfort, to amenities \u2014
p90
aVit was very, very difficult to imagine
p91
aVthat everything that we see in this image,
p92
aVwould be very, very stylishly packaged.
p93
aVAnd that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd I think that that digital revolution
p96
aVnow is coming to the point
p97
aVwhere, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,
p98
aVfinally connects with the physical world,
p99
aVthere is the reality that that has become humanized,
p100
aVso that digital world has all the friendliness,
p101
aVall the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
p102
aVProbably summed up in a way
p103
aVby the stylish or alternative available here,
p104
aVas we generously had gifted at lunchtime,
p105
aVthe [unclear], which is a further kind of development \u2014
p106
aVand again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
p107
aVA very, very beautiful object.
p108
aVSo, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive
p109
aVhas now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
p110
aVAnd the reference to the iPod as iconic,
p111
aVand in a way evocative of performance, delivery \u2014
p112
aVquite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,
p113
aVthe Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies
p114
aVenvy the halo effect that Toyota has gained
p115
aVfrom the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,
p116
aVwhich rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves \u2014
p119
aVas architects, or anybody involved with the design process \u2014
p120
aVthat the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
p121
aVBuildings are important, but
p122
aVthey're only a component of a much bigger picture.
p123
aVIn other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,
p124
aVif you could achieve the impossible,
p125
aVthe equivalent of perpetual motion,
p126
aVyou could design a carbon-free house, for example.
p127
aVThat would be the answer.
p128
aVUnfortunately, it's not the answer.
p129
aVIt's only the beginning of the problem.
p130
aVYou cannot separate the buildings out
p131
aVfrom the infrastructure of cites
p132
aVand the mobility of transit.
p133
aVFor example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back
p134
aVand we look at planet Earth,
p135
aVand we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,
p136
aVthen the energy consumed would be split
p137
aVbetween the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
p138
aVBut again, that only shows part of the picture.
p139
aVIf you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,
p140
aVin other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,
p141
aVthen 70 percent of the energy consumption
p142
aVis influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo the problems of sustainability
p145
aVcannot be separated from the nature of the cities,
p146
aVof which the buildings are a part.
p147
aVFor example, if you take, and you make a comparison
p148
aVbetween a recent kind of city,
p149
aVwhat I'll call, simplistically, a North American city \u2014
p150
aVand Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.
p151
aVThe city goes out in annular rings,
p152
aVconsuming more and more green space,
p153
aVand more and more roads, and more and more energy
p154
aVin the transport of people between the city center \u2014
p155
aVwhich again, the city center, as it becomes deprived
p156
aVof the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
p157
aVIf you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example \u2014
p158
aVand Munich is not a bad example of that,
p159
aVwith the greater dependence on walking and cycling \u2014
p160
aVthen a city which is really only twice as dense,
p161
aVis only using one-tenth of the energy.
p162
aVIn other words, you take these comparable examples
p163
aVand the energy leap is enormous.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate
p166
aVthat as the density increases along the bottom there,
p167
aVthat the energy consumed reduces dramatically.
p168
aVOf course you can't separate this out from issues like
p169
aVsocial diversity, mass transit,
p170
aVthe ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,
p171
aVthe quality of civic spaces.
p172
aVBut again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,
p173
aVextraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
p174
aVAnd Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,
p175
aVis not dense compared with the really dense cities.
p176
aVIn the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
p177
aVYou had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,
p178
aVwhich were occurring in the developing world.
p179
aVAnd now, out of typically 46 cities,
p180
aV33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
p181
aVSo you have to ask yourself \u2014 the environmental impact of,
p182
aVfor example, China or India.
p183
aVIf you take China, and you just take Beijing,
p184
aVyou can see on that traffic system,
p185
aVand the pollution associated with the consumption of energy
p186
aVas the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
p187
aVIn other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,
p188
aV1,000 new cars every day \u2014
p189
aVstatistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world \u2014
p190
aVand the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.
p193
aVSo, if we think of the transition in our society
p194
aVof the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,
p195
aVthen that same process is happening in 20 years.
p196
aVIn other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
p197
aVAnd quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,
p198
aVwe're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,
p199
aVover that period where the urbanization has trebled.
p200
aVIf I pull back from that global picture,
p201
aVand I look at the implication over a similar period of time
p202
aVin terms of the technology \u2014 which, as a tool,
p203
aVis a tool for designers,
p204
aVand I cite our own experience as a company,
p205
aVand I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects \u2014
p206
aVthen how do you measure that change of technology?
p207
aVHow does it affect the design of buildings?
p208
aVAnd particularly, how can it lead
p209
aVto the creation of buildings which consume less energy,
p210
aVcreate less pollution and are more socially responsible?
p211
aa(lp212
VThat story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.
p213
aVThe one example I take is a corporate headquarters
p214
aVfor a company called Willis and Faber,
p215
aVin a small market town in the northeast of England,
p216
aVcommuting distance with London.
p217
aVAnd here, the first thing you can see
p218
aVis that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of
p219
aVovercoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,
p220
aVwhich is also about the celebration of public space.
p221
aVIn other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
p222
aVSo the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,
p223
aVencapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,
p224
aVwhere you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,
p225
aVyou have a connection with nature.
p226
aVAnd nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
p227
aVAnd symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
p228
aVIt has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,
p229
aVit has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
p230
aVNow this was 1973.
p231
aa(lp232
VIn 2001, this building received an award.
p233
aVAnd the award was about a celebration for a building
p234
aVwhich had been in use over a long period of time.
p235
aVAnd the people who'd created it came back:
p236
aVthe project managers, the company chairmen then.
p237
aVAnd they were saying, you know,
p238
aV"The architects, Norman was always going on about
p239
aVdesigning for the future, and you know,
p240
aVit didn't seem to cost us any more.
p241
aVSo we humored him, we kept him happy."
p242
aVThe image at the top,
p243
aVwhat it doesn't \u2014 if you look at it in detail,
p244
aVreally what it is saying is you can wire this building.
p245
aVThis building was wired for change.
p246
aVSo, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
p247
aVAnd when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
p248
aVAnd what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors
p249
aVhad to build new buildings for the new technology.
p250
aVWe were fortunate,
p251
aVbecause in a way our building was future-proofed.
p252
aVIt anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
p253
aVRound about that design period leading up to this building,
p254
aVI did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.
p255
aVAnd I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,
p256
aVand we really don't have the immediate expertise
p257
aVat a technical level."
p258
aa(lp259
VIn other words, we didn't have the technology
p260
aVto do what would be really interesting on that building.
p261
aVAnd that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble \u2014
p262
aVa really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,
p263
aVwould breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.
p264
aVNotwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,
p265
aVis very much a pioneering building.
p266
aVAnd if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting
p267
aVis that the technology is now available and celebratory.
p268
aVThe library of the Free University, which opened last year,
p269
aVis an example of that.
p270
aVAnd again, the transition from one of the many thousands
p271
aVof sketches and computer images to the reality.
p272
aVAnd a combination of devices here,
p273
aVthe kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,
p274
aVand the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,
p275
aVwhich enables the building to be ventilated,
p276
aVto consume dramatically less energy,
p277
aVand where it's really working with the forces of nature.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd what is interesting is that this is hugely popular
p280
aVby the people who use it.
p281
aVAgain, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,
p282
aVand in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.
p283
aVSo it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.
p284
aVI think it's a great \u2014 it's a celebration.
p285
aVAnd you can measure the performance,
p286
aVin terms of energy consumption, of that building
p287
aVagainst a typical library.
p288
aVIf I show another aspect of that technology
p289
aVthen, in a completely different context \u2014
p290
aVthis apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.
p291
aVPrefabricated from the most traditional of materials,
p292
aVbut that material \u2014 because of the technology, the computing ability,
p293
aVthe ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components
p294
aVout of timber \u2014 very much at the cutting edge.
p295
aVAnd just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,
p296
aVthe ability to plot points in the sky
p297
aVand to transmit, to transfer that information
p298
aVnow, directly into the factory.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo if you cross the border \u2014 just across the border \u2014
p301
aVa small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,
p302
aVand those points in space are communicated.
p303
aVAnd on the left are the cutting machines,
p304
aVwhich then, in the factory,
p305
aVenable those individual pieces to be fabricated
p306
aVand plus or minus very, very few millimeters,
p307
aVto be slotted together on site.
p308
aVAnd then interestingly, that building to then be clad
p309
aVin the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
p310
aVOne quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
p311
aVAnd again, the way in which that works as a building,
p312
aVfor those of us who can enjoy the spaces,
p313
aVto live and visit there.
p314
aVIf I made the leap into these new technologies,
p315
aVthen how did we \u2014 what happened before that?
p316
aVI mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,
p317
aVthe things that you take for granted?
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, obviously the building still happened.
p320
aVI mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,
p321
aVwhich opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight
p322
aVdeep into the heart of this space here.
p323
aVAnd in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
p324
aVSo for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
p325
aVFor wind tunnels, we would literally put them
p326
aVin a wind tunnel and blast air,
p327
aVand the many kilometers of cable and so on.
p328
aVAnd the turning point was probably, in our terms,
p329
aVwhen we had the first computer.
p330
aVAnd that was at the time that we sought
p331
aVto redesign, reinvent the airport.
p332
aVThis is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal \u2014
p333
aVbig, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,
p334
aVlots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd Stansted, the green alternative,
p337
aVwhich uses natural light, is a friendly place:
p338
aVyou know where you are, you can relate to the outside.
p339
aVAnd for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light \u2014
p340
aVelectric light, which in turn creates more heat,
p341
aVwhich creates more cooling loads and so on.
p342
aVAnd at that particular point in time,
p343
aVthis was one of the few solitary computers.
p344
aVAnd that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.
p345
aVNot going back very far in time, 1990,
p346
aVthat's our office.
p347
aVAnd if you looked very closely, you'd see
p348
aVthat people were drawing with pencils,
p349
aVand they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
p350
aVIt's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
p351
aVI mean, major transformation.
p352
aa(lp353
VGoing back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,
p354
aVand in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.
p355
aVNow, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,
p356
aVwhich record our archival information
p357
aVon past, current and future projects.
p358
aVThat reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
p359
aVThis is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
p360
aVBut meanwhile, as you know,
p361
aVwonderful protagonists like Al Gore
p362
aVare noting the inexorable rise in temperature,
p363
aVset in the context of that,
p364
aVinterestingly, those buildings which are celebratory
p365
aVand very, very relevant to this place.
p366
aa(lp367
VOur Reichstag project,
p368
aVwhich has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,
p369
aVas a public place where we sought to, in a way,
p370
aVthrough a process of advocacy,
p371
aVreinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,
p372
aVpublic space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto \u2014
p373
aVsomething that would be free, completely free
p374
aVof fuel as we know it.
p375
aVSo it would be totally renewable.
p376
aVAnd again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,
p377
aVbut this very, very much a part of the ecology.
p378
aVBut here, not having to model it for real.
p379
aVObviously the wind tunnel had a place,
p380
aVbut the ability now with the computer
p381
aVto explore, to plan, to see how that would work
p382
aVin terms of the forces of nature:
p383
aVnatural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,
p384
aVand to look at biomass.
p385
aVA combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil \u2014
p386
aVa process that, quite interestingly, was developed
p387
aVin Eastern Germany, at the time of its
p388
aVdependence on the Soviet Bloc.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo really, retranslating that technology and developing something
p391
aVwhich was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
p392
aVYou can measure it again.
p393
aVYou can compare how that building, in terms of its emission
p394
aVin tons of carbon dioxide per year \u2014
p395
aVat the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons \u2014
p396
aVwhat it would have been with natural gas
p397
aVand finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.
p398
aVI mean, a 94 percent reduction \u2014 virtually clean.
p399
aVWe can see the same processes at work
p400
aVin terms of the Commerce Bank \u2014
p401
aVits dependence on natural ventilation,
p402
aVthe way that you can model those gardens,
p403
aVthe way they spiral around.
p404
aVBut again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality \u2014
p405
aVsomething that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
p406
aVAnd again, we can measure the reduction
p407
aVin terms of energy consumption.
p408
aa(lp409
VThere is an evolution here between the projects,
p410
aVand Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further \u2014
p411
aVthe project in the city in London.
p412
aVAnd this sequence shows the buildup of that model.
p413
aVBut what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,
p414
aVis that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.
p415
aVWhat are the other ways of putting
p416
aVthe same amount of space on the site?
p417
aVIf, for example, you seek to do a building
p418
aVwhich goes right to the edge of the pavement,
p419
aVit's the same amount of space.
p420
aVAnd finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.
p421
aVThe grooves become the kind of green lungs
p422
aVwhich give views, which give light, ventilation,
p423
aVmake the building fresher.
p424
aVAnd you enclose that with something that also
p425
aVis central to its appearance,
p426
aVwhich is a mesh of triangulated structures \u2014
p427
aVagain, in a long connection evocative of
p428
aVsome of those works of Buckminster Fuller,
p429
aVand the way in which triangulation can increase performance
p430
aVand also give that building its sense of identity.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd here, if we look at a detail of the way
p433
aVthat the building opens up and breathes into those atria,
p434
aVthe way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,
p435
aVwe can see the high pressure, the low pressure,
p436
aVthe way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
p437
aVSo it also has the ability, all the time,
p438
aVregardless of the direction of the wind,
p439
aVto be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
p440
aVAnd unlike conventional buildings,
p441
aVthe top of the building is celebratory.
p442
aVIt's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
p443
aVAnd the base of the building is again about public space.
p444
aVComparing it with a typical building,
p445
aVwhat happens if we seek to use such design strategies
p446
aVin terms of really large-scale thinking?
p447
aVAnd I'm just going to give two images
p448
aVout of a kind of company research project.
p449
aa(lp450
VIt's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.
p451
aVThe level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
p452
aVAnd the Dead Sea is obviously much lower
p453
aVthan the oceans and seas around it.
p454
aVSo there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea
p455
aVby creating a pipeline, a pipe,
p456
aVsometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,
p457
aVthat will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba
p458
aVinto the Dead Sea.
p459
aVAnd our translation of that,
p460
aVusing a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,
p461
aVwhat if that, instead of being just a pipe,
p462
aVwhat if it is a lifeline?
p463
aVWhat if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,
p464
aVof the Grand Canal,
p465
aVin terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
p466
aVIn other words, water is the lifeblood.
p467
aa(lp468
VAnd if you just go back to the previous image,
p469
aVand you look at this area of volatility and hostility,
p470
aVthat a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture
p471
aVcould have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
p472
aVin a united cause, in terms of something that would be
p473
aVgenuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
p474
aVInfrastructure at that large scale is also
p475
aVinseparable from communication.
p476
aVAnd whether that communication is the virtual world
p477
aVor it is the physical world,
p478
aVthen it's absolutely central to society.
p479
aVAnd how do we make more legible in this growing world,
p480
aVespecially in some of the places that I'm talking about \u2014
p481
aVChina, for example, which in the next ten years
p482
aVwill create 400 new airports.
p483
aVNow what form do they take?
p484
aVHow do you make them more friendly at that scale?
p485
aa(lp486
VHong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,
p487
aVbecause you always have a point of reference.
p488
aVSo what happens when we take that and you expand that further
p489
aVinto the Chinese society?
p490
aVAnd what is interesting is that that produces in a way
p491
aVperhaps the ultimate mega-building.
p492
aVIt is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
p493
aV250 \u2014 excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
p494
aVLarger by 17 percent than every terminal put together
p495
aVat Heathrow \u2014 built \u2014 plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
p496
aVAnd the challenge here is a building that will be green,
p497
aVthat is compact despite its size
p498
aVand is about the human experience of travel,
p499
aVis about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,
p500
aVis very, very much about the lifestyle.
p501
aVAnd perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
p502
aa(lp503
VAs Hubert was talking over lunch,
p504
aVas we sort of engaged in conversation,
p505
aVtalked about this, talked about cities.
p506
aVHubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
p507
aVAnd in a way, one aspect of this conversation
p508
aVwas triggered on New Year's Eve,
p509
aVwhen I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China
p510
aVin terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
p511
aVAnd I was voicing the thought that \u2014
p512
aVit just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,
p513
aVa sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 \u2014
p514
aVthat maybe, you know, the future was
p515
aVthe most powerful, innovative sort of nation.
p516
aVThe way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,
p517
aV"We put a man on the moon."
p518
aa(lp519
VYou know, who is going to say
p520
aVthat we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,
p521
aVwith all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.
p522
aVAnd that's a concerted platform.
p523
aVIt's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.
p524
aVAnd I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,
p525
aVI thought that the inspiration was more likely
p526
aVto come from those other, larger countries out there \u2014
p527
aVthe Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.
p528
aVThank you very much.
