VIn an age of global strife and climate change,
p4
aVI'm here to answer the all important question:
p5
aVWhy is sex so damn good?
p6
aVIf you're laughing, you know what I mean.
p7
aa(lp8
VNow, before we get to that answer,
p9
aVlet me tell you about Chris Hosmer.
p10
aVChris is a great friend of mine from my university days,
p11
aVbut secretly, I hate him.
p12
aa(lp13
VHere's why. Back in university, we had a quick project
p14
aVto design some solar-powered clocks.
p15
aVHere's my clock.
p16
aVIt uses something called the dwarf sunflower,
p17
aVwhich grows to about 12 inches in height.
p18
aVNow, as you know, sunflowers
p19
aVtrack the sun during the course of the day.
p20
aVSo in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing,
p21
aVand you mark it on the blank area in the base.
p22
aVAt noon, you mark the changed position of the sunflower,
p23
aVand in the evening again, and that's your clock.
p24
aVNow, I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time,
p25
aVbut it does give you a general idea using a flower.
p26
aVSo, in my completely unbiased, subjective opinion,
p27
aVit's brilliant.
p28
aa(lp29
VHowever, here's Chris's clock.
p30
aVIt's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one.
p31
aVIn each shot glass is a different scented oil.
p32
aVIn the morning, the sunlight will shine down
p33
aVon the first magnifying glass,
p34
aVfocusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath.
p35
aVThis will warm up the scented oil inside,
p36
aVand a particular smell will be emitted.
p37
aVA couple of hours later, the sun will shine
p38
aVon the next magnifying glass, and a different smell will be emitted.
p39
aVSo during the course of the day, five different smells
p40
aVare dispersed throughout that environment.
p41
aVAnyone living in that house can tell the time
p42
aVjust by the smell.
p43
aVYou can see why I hate Chris.
p44
aVI thought my idea was pretty good,
p45
aVbut his idea is genius,
p46
aVand at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine,
p47
aVbut I just couldn't explain why.
p48
aa(lp49
VOne thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose.
p50
aVThis problem's been bugging me for well over a decade.
p51
aVAll right, let's get back to the question of why sex is so good.
p52
aVMany years after the solar powered clocks project,
p53
aVa young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good
p54
aVbecause of the five senses.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd when she said this, I had an epiphany.
p57
aVSo I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life
p58
aVfrom the point of view of the five senses.
p59
aVTo do this, I devised something called the five senses graph.
p60
aVAlong the y-axis, you have a scale from zero to 10,
p61
aVand along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses.
p62
aVAnytime I had a memorable experience in my life,
p63
aVI would record it on this graph like a five senses diary.
p64
aVHere's a quick video to show you how it works.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,
p67
aVand today, I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes
p68
aVis like from the point of view of the five senses. Hey!
p69
aa(lp70
VBike designer: This is [unclear], custom bike designer.

p79
aa(lp80
V[Smell]
p81
aa(lp82
V[Taste]
p83
aa(lp84
VJL: And that's how the five senses graph works.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, for a period of three years, I gathered data,
p87
aVnot just me but also some of my friends,
p88
aVand I used to teach in university, so I forced my \u2014
p89
aVI mean, I asked my students to do this as well.
p90
aVSo here are some other results.
p91
aVThe first is for instant noodles.
p92
aVNow obviously, taste and smell are quite high,
p93
aVbut notice sound is at three.
p94
aVMany people told me a big part
p95
aVof the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise.
p96
aVYou know. (Slurps)
p97
aVNeedless to say, I no longer dine with these people.
p98
aa(lp99
VOK, next, clubbing.
p100
aVOK, here what I found interesting was
p101
aVthat taste is at four, and many respondents told me
p102
aVit's because of the taste of drinks,
p103
aVbut also, in some cases, kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience.
p104
aVThese people I still do hang out with.
p105
aa(lp106
VAll right, and smoking.
p107
aVHere I found touch is at [six], and one of the reasons
p108
aVis that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette
p109
aVand bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience,
p110
aVwhich shows, it's kind of scary to think
p111
aVhow well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers.
p112
aa(lp113
VOK. Now, what would the perfect experience
p114
aVlook like on the five senses graph?
p115
aVIt would, of course, be a horizontal line along the top.
p116
aVNow you can see, not even as intense an experience
p117
aVas riding a motorbike comes close.
p118
aa(lp119
VIn fact, in the years that I gathered data,
p120
aVonly one experience came close to being the perfect one.
p121
aVThat is, of course, sex. Great sex.
p122
aVRespondents said that great sex
p123
aVhits all of the five senses at an extreme level.
p124
aa(lp125
VHere I'll quote one of my students who said,
p126
aV"Sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo the five senses theory does help explain
p129
aVwhy sex is so good.
p130
aVNow in the middle of all this five senses work,
p131
aVI suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project
p132
aVfrom my youth.
p133
aVAnd I realized this theory also explains why Chris's clock
p134
aVis so much better than mine.
p135
aVYou see, my clock only focuses on sight,
p136
aVand a little bit of touch.
p137
aVHere's Chris's clock.
p138
aVIt's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time.
p139
aVIn fact, in terms of the five senses,
p140
aVChris's clock is a revolution.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd that's what this theory taught me about my field.
p143
aVYou see, up till now, us designers,
p144
aVwe've mainly focused on making things look very pretty,
p145
aVand a little bit of touch,
p146
aVwhich means we've ignored the other three senses.
p147
aVChris's clock shows us that even raising just one
p148
aVof those other senses can make for a brilliant product.
p149
aVSo what if we started using the five senses theory
p150
aVin all of our designs?
p151
aa(lp152
VHere's three quick ideas I came up with.
p153
aVThis is an iron, you know, for your clothes,
p154
aVto which I added a spraying mechanism,
p155
aVso you fill up the vial with your favorite scent,
p156
aVand your clothes will smell nicer,
p157
aVbut hopefully it should also make
p158
aVthe ironing experience more enjoyable.
p159
aVWe could call this "the perfumator."
p160
aa(lp161
VAll right, next.
p162
aVSo I brush my teeth twice a day,
p163
aVand what if we had a toothbrush
p164
aVthat tastes like candy,
p165
aVand when the taste of candy ran out,
p166
aVyou'd know it's time to change your toothbrush?
p167
aa(lp168
VFinally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet.
p169
aVIt's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel
p170
aVwhen you press down on them.
p171
aVNow, I don't play the flute or the clarinet,
p172
aVso I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play:
p173
aVthe television remote control.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, when we look at these three ideas together,
p176
aVyou'll notice that the five senses theory
p177
aVdoesn't only change the way we use these products
p178
aVbut also the way they look.
p179
aVSo in conclusion, I've found the five senses theory
p180
aVto be a very useful tool in evaluating
p181
aVdifferent experiences in my life,
p182
aVand then taking those best experiences
p183
aVand hopefully incorporating them into my designs.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, I realize the five senses isn't the only thing
p186
aVthat makes life interesting.
p187
aVThere's also the six emotions
p188
aVand that elusive x-factor.
p189
aVMaybe that could be the topic of my next talk.
p190
aa(lp191
VUntil then, please have fun
p192
aVusing the five senses in your own lives
p193
aVand your own designs.
p194
aa(lp195
VOh, one last thing before I leave.
p196
aVHere's the experience you all had while listening
p197
aVto the TED Talks.
p198
aVHowever, it would be better if we could boost up
p199
aVa couple of the other senses like smell and taste.
p200
aVAnd the best way to do that is with
p201
aVfree candy.
p202
aVYou guys ready?
p203
aVAll right.
