VA month ago today
p4
aVI stood there:
p5
aV90 degrees south, the top of
p6
aVthe bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.
p7
aVAnd I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,
p8
aVRichard Weber and Kevin Vallely.
p9
aVTogether we had just broken the world speed record
p10
aVfor a trek to the South Pole.
p11
aVIt took us 33 days,
p12
aV23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.
p13
aVWe shaved five days off the previous best time.
p14
aVAnd in the process, I became the first person in history
p15
aVto make the entire 650-mile journey,
p16
aVfrom Hercules Inlet to South Pole,
p17
aVsolely on feet, without skis.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,
p20
aVis this tough to do?"
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVImagine, if you will,
p23
aVdragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,
p24
aVwith 170 pounds of gear,
p25
aVin it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.
p26
aVIt's going to be 40 below, every single day.
p27
aVYou'll be in a massive headwind.
p28
aVAnd at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,
p29
aVthese crevasses.
p30
aVSome of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them
p31
aVthat could give way at a moment's notice,
p32
aVtaking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.
p33
aVThe punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.
p34
aVYes, it's uphill the entire way,
p35
aVbecause the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,
p36
aVand you're starting at sea level.
p37
aa(lp38
VOur journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,
p39
aVwhere frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.
p40
aVIt began a little less than two years ago.
p41
aVA couple of buddies of mine and I
p42
aVhad finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.
p43
aVAnd while we were there we learned
p44
aVthe seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.
p45
aVWe also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa
p46
aVaffected young people the most.
p47
aVI came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,
p48
aVand I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,
p49
aVwe are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."
p50
aVBut if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be
p51
aVa reason for me to do them
p52
aVbeyond just getting there.
p53
aa(lp54
VAround that time I met an extraordinary human being,
p55
aVPeter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.
p56
aVHe's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.
p57
aVHis dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:
p58
aVa run to the South Pole
p59
aVwhere, with an interactive website,
p60
aVI will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world
p61
aVon board the expedition with me,
p62
aVas active members.
p63
aVSo we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,
p64
aVwe would be blogging, telling stories of,
p65
aVyou know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,
p66
aVor we will burn.
p67
aVCrossing miles and miles of sastrugi \u2014
p68
aVfrozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.
p69
aVI'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,
p70
aVthat sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,
p71
aVbecause that's what it felt like.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe were blogging to this live website daily
p74
aVto these students that were tracking us as well,
p75
aVabout 10-hour trekking days,
p76
aV15-hour trekking days,
p77
aVsometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.
p78
aVWe'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.
p79
aVIn turn, students,
p80
aVpeople from around the world, would ask us questions.
p81
aVYoung people would ask the most amazing questions.
p82
aa(lp83
VOne of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,
p84
aVwhere are you going to go and how are you going to do it?
p85
aVI'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.
p86
aa(lp87
VWhere do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,
p88
aVbecause the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.
p89
aa(lp90
VWhat do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:
p91
aVbutter and bacon. It's about a million calories.
p92
aVWe were burning about 8,500 a day,
p93
aVso we needed it.
p94
aa(lp95
VHow many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?
p96
aVVirtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,
p97
aVwas charged by the sun.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd do you get along? I certainly hope so,
p100
aVbecause at some point or another on this expedition,
p101
aVone of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,
p102
aVand put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut seriously, seriously, we did get along,
p105
aVbecause we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.
p106
aVThey were our teammates! They were inspiring us.
p107
aVThe stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.
p108
aVThe website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.
p109
aVYoung people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,
p110
aVdragging sleds across the school-yard,
p111
aVpretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.
p112
aa(lp113
VWe arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,
p114
aV45 below that day, I'll never forget it.
p115
aVWe looked at each other with these looks
p116
aVof disbelief at what we had just completed.
p117
aVAnd I remember looking at the guys thinking,
p118
aV"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.
p119
aVThat I'm this uber-endurance guy?
p120
aa(lp121
VAs I stand here today talking to you guys,
p122
aVI've been running for the grand sum of five years.
p123
aVAnd a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,
p124
aVliving a very sedentary lifestyle.
p125
aVWhat I take from this journey, from my journeys,
p126
aVis that, in fact,
p127
aVwithin every fiber of my belief standing here,
p128
aVI know that we can make the impossible possible.
p129
aVI'm learning this at 40.
p130
aVCan you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?
p131
aVI'm learning this at 40 years of age.
p132
aVImagine being 13 years old,
p133
aVhearing those words, and believing it.
p134
aVThank you very much. Thank you.
