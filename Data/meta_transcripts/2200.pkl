VI dedicated the past two years to understanding
p4
aVhow people achieve their dreams.
p5
aVWhen we think about the dreams we have,
p6
aVand the dent we want to leave in the universe,
p7
aVit is striking to see how big of an overlap there is
p8
aVbetween the dreams that we have, and projects that never happen.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo I'm here to talk to you today
p13
aVabout five ways how not to follow your dreams.
p14
aa(lp15
VOne: Believe in overnight success.
p16
aVYou know the story, right?
p17
aVThe tech guy built a mobile app and sold it very fast for a lot of money.
p18
aVYou know, the story may seem real, but I bet it's incomplete.
p19
aVIf you go investigate further,
p20
aVthe guy has done 30 apps before
p21
aVand he has done a master's on the topic, a PhD.
p22
aVHe has been working on the topic for 20 years.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is really interesting.
p25
aVI myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight success.
p26
aVI come from a humble family,
p27
aVand two weeks before the deadline to apply for MIT,
p28
aVI started the application process.
p29
aVAnd, voilà! I got in.
p30
aVPeople may think it's an overnight success,
p31
aVbut that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that,
p32
aVI took life and education seriously.
p33
aVYour overnight success story is always a result
p34
aVof everything you've done in your life through that moment.
p35
aa(lp36
VTwo: Believe someone else has the answers for you.
p37
aVConstantly, people want to help out, right?
p38
aVAll sorts of people: your family, your friends, your business partners,
p39
aVthey all have opinions on which path you should take:
p40
aV"And let me tell you, go through this pipe."
p41
aVBut whenever you go inside,
p42
aVthere are other ways you have to pick as well.
p43
aVAnd you need to make those decisions yourself.
p44
aVNo one else has the perfect answers for your life.
p45
aVAnd you need to keep picking those decisions, right?
p46
aVThe pipes are infinite and you're going to bump your head,
p47
aVand it's a part of the process.
p48
aa(lp49
VThree, and it's very subtle but very important:
p50
aVDecide to settle when growth is guaranteed.
p51
aVSo when your life is going great,
p52
aVyou have put together a great team,
p53
aVand you have growing revenue, and everything is set \u2014
p54
aVtime to settle.
p55
aVWhen I launched my first book,
p56
aVI worked really, really hard to distribute it everywhere in Brazil.
p57
aVWith that, over three million people downloaded it,
p58
aVover 50,000 people bought physical copies.
p59
aVWhen I wrote a sequel, some impact was guaranteed.
p60
aVEven if I did little, sales would be OK.
p61
aVBut OK is never OK.
p62
aVWhen you're growing towards a peak,
p63
aVyou need to work harder than ever and find yourself another peak.
p64
aVMaybe if I did little,
p65
aVa couple hundred thousand people would read it,
p66
aVand that's great already.
p67
aVBut if I work harder than ever,
p68
aVI can bring this number up to millions.
p69
aVThat's why I decided, with my new book, to go to every single state of Brazil.
p70
aVAnd I can already see a higher peak.
p71
aVThere's no time to settle down.
p72
aa(lp73
VFourth tip, and that's really important:
p74
aVBelieve the fault is someone else's.
p75
aVI constantly see people saying,
p76
aV"Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision to invest."
p77
aV"Oh, I created this great product,
p78
aVbut the market is so bad, the sales didn't go well."
p79
aVOr, "I can't find good talent; my team is so below expectations."
p80
aVIf you have dreams,
p81
aVit's your responsibility to make them happen.
p82
aVYes, it may be hard to find talent.
p83
aVYes, the market may be bad.
p84
aVBut if no one invested in your idea,
p85
aVif no one bought your product,
p86
aVfor sure, there is something there that is your fault.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VDefinitely.
p91
aVYou need to get your dreams and make them happen.
p92
aVAnd no one achieved their goals alone.
p93
aVBut if you didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's.
p94
aVBe responsible for your dreams.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd one last tip, and this one is really important as well:
p97
aVBelieve that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves.
p98
aVOnce I saw an ad, and it was a lot of friends,
p99
aVthey were going up a mountain, it was a very high mountain,
p100
aVand it was a lot of work.
p101
aVYou could see that they were sweating and this was tough.
p102
aVAnd they were going up, and they finally made it to the peak.
p103
aVOf course, they decided to celebrate, right?
p104
aVI'm going to celebrate, so, "Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"
p105
aVTwo seconds later, one looks at the other and says,
p106
aV"OK, let's go down."
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VLife is never about the goals themselves.
p111
aVLife is about the journey.
p112
aVYes, you should enjoy the goals themselves,
p113
aVbut people think that you have dreams,
p114
aVand whenever you get to reaching one of those dreams,
p115
aVit's a magical place where happiness will be all around.
p116
aVBut achieving a dream is a momentary sensation,
p117
aVand your life is not.
p118
aVThe only way to really achieve all of your dreams
p119
aVis to fully enjoy every step of your journey.
p120
aVThat's the best way.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd your journey is simple \u2014 it's made of steps.
p123
aVSome steps will be right on.
p124
aVSometimes you will trip.
p125
aVIf it's right on, celebrate, because some people wait a lot to celebrate.
p126
aVAnd if you tripped, turn that into something to learn.
p127
aVIf every step becomes something to learn or something to celebrate,
p128
aVyou will for sure enjoy the journey.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, five tips:
p131
aVBelieve in overnight success,
p132
aVbelieve someone else has the answers for you,
p133
aVbelieve that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down,
p134
aVbelieve the fault is someone else's,
p135
aVand believe that only the goals themselves matter.
p136
aVBelieve me, you do that, and you will destroy your dreams.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.
p143
aa(lp144
VThanks.
