VI'd like to reimagine education.
p4
aVThe last year
p5
aVhas seen the invention of a new four-letter word.
p6
aVIt starts with an M.
p7
aVMOOC: massive open online courses.
p8
aVMany organizations
p9
aVare offering these online courses
p10
aVto students all over the world, in the millions, for free.
p11
aVAnybody who has an Internet connection
p12
aVand the will to learn can access these great courses
p13
aVfrom excellent universities
p14
aVand get a credential at the end of it.
p15
aVNow, in this discussion today,
p16
aVI'm going to focus
p17
aVon a different aspect of MOOCs.
p18
aVWe are taking what we are learning
p19
aVand the technologies we are developing in the large
p20
aVand applying them in the small
p21
aVto create a blended model of education
p22
aVto really reinvent and reimagine
p23
aVwhat we do in the classroom.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, our classrooms could use change.
p26
aVSo, here's a classroom
p27
aVat this little three-letter institute
p28
aVin the Northeast of America, MIT.
p29
aVAnd this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,
p30
aVand this is a classroom today.
p31
aVWhat's changed?
p32
aVThe seats are in color.
p33
aVWhoop-de-do.
p34
aVEducation really hasn't changed
p35
aVin the past 500 years.
p36
aVThe last big innovation in education
p37
aVwas the printing press and the textbooks.
p38
aVEverything else has changed around us.
p39
aVYou know, from healthcare to transportation,
p40
aVeverything is different, but education hasn't changed.
p41
aa(lp42
VIt's also been a real issue in terms of access.
p43
aVSo what you see here
p44
aVis not a rock concert.
p45
aVAnd the person you see at the end of the stage
p46
aVis not Madonna.
p47
aVThis is a classroom
p48
aVat the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.
p49
aVNow, we've all heard of distance education,
p50
aVbut the students way in the back,
p51
aV200 feet away from the instructor,
p52
aVI think they are undergoing long-distance education.
p53
aVNow, I really believe
p54
aVthat we can transform education,
p55
aVboth in quality and scale and access,
p56
aVthrough technology.
p57
aVFor example, at edX,
p58
aVwe are trying to transform education
p59
aVthrough online technologies.
p60
aVGiven education has been calcified for 500 years,
p61
aVwe really cannot think about reengineering it,
p62
aVmicromanaging it.
p63
aVWe really have to completely reimagine it.
p64
aVIt's like going from ox carts to the airplane.
p65
aVEven the infrastructure has to change.
p66
aVEverything has to change.
p67
aVWe need to go from lectures on the blackboard
p68
aVto online exercises, online videos.
p69
aVWe have to go to interactive virtual laboratories
p70
aVand gamification.
p71
aVWe have to go to completely online grading
p72
aVand peer interaction and discussion boards.
p73
aVEverything really has to change.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo at edX and a number of other organizations,
p76
aVwe are applying these technologies to education
p77
aVthrough MOOCs to really increase access to education.
p78
aVAnd you heard of this example,
p79
aVwhere, when we launched our very first course \u2014
p80
aVand this was an MIT-hard
p81
aVcircuits and electronics course \u2014
p82
aVabout a year and a half ago,
p83
aV155,000 students from 162 countries
p84
aVenrolled in this course.
p85
aVAnd we had no marketing budget.
p86
aVNow, 155,000 is a big number.
p87
aVThis number is bigger
p88
aVthan the total number of alumni of MIT
p89
aVin its 150-year history.
p90
aV7,200 students passed the course,
p91
aVand this was a hard course.
p92
aV7,200 is also a big number.
p93
aVIf I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,
p94
aVI would have to teach for 40 years
p95
aVbefore I could teach this many students.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow these large numbers
p98
aVare just one part of the story.
p99
aVSo today, I want to discuss a different aspect,
p100
aVthe other side of MOOCs,
p101
aVtake a different perspective.
p102
aVWe are taking what we develop and learn in the large
p103
aVand applying it in the small
p104
aVto the classroom, to create a blended model of learning.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut before I go into that, let me tell you a story.
p107
aVWhen my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,
p108
aVshe stopped speaking English,
p109
aVand she began speaking this new language.
p110
aVI call it teen-lish.
p111
aVIt's a digital language.
p112
aVIt's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.
p113
aa(lp114
V"Honey, come over for dinner."
p115
aa(lp116
V"Hmm."
p117
aa(lp118
V"Did you hear me?"
p119
aa(lp120
VSilence. (Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
V"Can you listen to me?"
p123
aa(lp124
V"Hmm."
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we had a real issue with communicating,
p127
aVand we were just not communicating,
p128
aVuntil one day I had this epiphany.
p129
aVI texted her. (Laughter)
p130
aVI got an instant response.
p131
aVI said, no, that must have been by accident.
p132
aVShe must have thought, you know,
p133
aVsome friend of hers was calling her.
p134
aVSo I texted her again. Boom, another response.
p135
aVI said, this is great.
p136
aVAnd so since then, our life has changed.
p137
aVI text her, she responds.
p138
aVIt's just been absolutely great.
p139
aV(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VSo our millennial generation
p142
aVis built differently.
p143
aVNow, I'm older, and my youthful looks might belie that,
p144
aVbut I'm not in the millennial generation.
p145
aVBut our kids are really different.
p146
aVThe millennial generation is completely comfortable
p147
aVwith online technology.
p148
aVSo why are we fighting it in the classroom?
p149
aVLet's not fight it. Let's embrace it.
p150
aVIn fact, I believe \u2014 and I have two fat thumbs,
p151
aVI can't text very well \u2014
p152
aVbut I'm willing to bet that with evolution,
p153
aVour kids and their grandchildren
p154
aVwill develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs
p155
aVto text much better,
p156
aVthat evolution will fix all of that stuff.
p157
aVBut what if we embraced technology,
p158
aVembraced the millennial generation's
p159
aVnatural predilections,
p160
aVand really think about creating these online technologies,
p161
aVblend them into their lives.
p162
aVSo here's what we can do.
p163
aVSo rather than driving our kids into a classroom,
p164
aVherding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning \u2014
p165
aVI hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,
p166
aVso why are we forcing our kids to do that?
p167
aVSo instead what you do
p168
aVis you have them watch videos
p169
aVand do interactive exercises
p170
aVin the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,
p171
aVin the dining room, in the bathroom,
p172
aVwherever they're most creative.
p173
aVThen they come into the classroom
p174
aVfor some in-person interaction.
p175
aVThey can have discussions amongst themselves.
p176
aVThey can solve problems together.
p177
aVThey can work with the professor
p178
aVand have the professor answer their questions.
p179
aVIn fact, with edX, when we were teaching our first course
p180
aVon circuits and electronics around the world,
p181
aVthis was happening unbeknownst to us.
p182
aVTwo high school teachers
p183
aVat the Sant High School in Mongolia
p184
aVhad flipped their classroom,
p185
aVand they were using our video lectures
p186
aVand interactive exercises,
p187
aVwhere the learners in the high school,
p188
aV15-year-olds, mind you,
p189
aVwould go and do these things in their own homes
p190
aVand they would come into class,
p191
aVand as you see from this image here,
p192
aVthey would interact with each other
p193
aVand do some physical laboratory work.
p194
aVAnd the only way we discovered this
p195
aVwas they wrote a blog
p196
aVand we happened to stumble upon that blog.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe were also doing other pilots.
p199
aVSo we did a pilot experimental blended courses,
p200
aVworking with San Jose State University in California,
p201
aVagain, with the circuits and electronics course.
p202
aVYou'll hear that a lot. That course has become
p203
aVsort of like our petri dish of learning.
p204
aVSo there, the students would, again,
p205
aVthe instructors flipped the classroom,
p206
aVblended online and in person,
p207
aVand the results were staggering.
p208
aVNow don't take these results to the bank just yet.
p209
aVJust wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more,
p210
aVbut the early results are incredible.
p211
aVSo traditionally, semester upon semester,
p212
aVfor the past several years, this course,
p213
aVagain, a hard course,
p214
aVhad a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent
p215
aVevery semester.
p216
aVWith this blended class late last year,
p217
aVthe failure rate fell to nine percent.
p218
aVSo the results can be extremely, extremely good.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow before we go too far into this,
p221
aVI'd like to spend some time discussing
p222
aVsome key ideas.
p223
aVWhat are some key ideas
p224
aVthat makes all of this work?
p225
aa(lp226
VOne idea is active learning.
p227
aVThe idea here is, rather than have students
p228
aVwalk into class and watch lectures,
p229
aVwe replace this with what we call lessons.
p230
aVLessons are interleaved sequences
p231
aVof videos and interactive exercises.
p232
aVSo a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video
p233
aVand follow that with an interactive exercise.
p234
aVThink of this as the ultimate Socratization of education.
p235
aVYou teach by asking questions.
p236
aVAnd this is a form of learning
p237
aVcalled active learning,
p238
aVand really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,
p239
aVby Craik and Lockhart,
p240
aVwhere they said and discovered
p241
aVthat learning and retention really relates strongly
p242
aVto the depth of mental processing.
p243
aVStudents learn much better
p244
aVwhen they are interacting with the material.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe second idea is self-pacing.
p247
aVNow, when I went to a lecture hall,
p248
aVand if you were like me,
p249
aVby the fifth minute I would lose the professor.
p250
aVI wasn't all that smart, and I would be scrambling, taking notes,
p251
aVand then I would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour.
p252
aVInstead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,
p253
aVwe offer videos and interactive engagements to students?
p254
aVThey can hit the pause button.
p255
aVThey can rewind the professor.
p256
aVHeck, they can even mute the professor.
p257
aVSo this form of self-pacing
p258
aVcan be very helpful to learning.
p259
aa(lp260
VThe third idea that we have is instant feedback.
p261
aVWith instant feedback,
p262
aVthe computer grades exercises.
p263
aVI mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?
p264
aVYour computer is grading all the exercises.
p265
aVAnd we've all submitted homeworks,
p266
aVand your grades come back two weeks later,
p267
aVyou've forgotten all about it.
p268
aVI don't think I've still received some of my homeworks
p269
aVfrom my undergraduate days.
p270
aVSome are never graded.
p271
aVSo with instant feedback,
p272
aVstudents can try to apply answers.
p273
aVIf they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.
p274
aVThey can try it again and try it again,
p275
aVand this really becomes much more engaging.
p276
aVThey get the instant feedback,
p277
aVand this little green check mark that you see here
p278
aVis becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.
p279
aVLearners are telling us that they go to bed at night
p280
aVdreaming of the green check mark.
p281
aVIn fact, one of our learners
p282
aVwho took the circuits course early last year,
p283
aVhe then went on to take a software course
p284
aVfrom Berkeley at the end of the year,
p285
aVand this is what the learner had to say
p286
aVon our discussion board
p287
aVwhen he just started that course
p288
aVabout the green check mark:
p289
aV"Oh god; have I missed you."
p290
aVWhen's the last time you've seen students
p291
aVposting comments like this about homework?
p292
aVMy colleague Ed Bertschinger,
p293
aVwho heads up the physics department at MIT,
p294
aVhas this to say about instant feedback:
p295
aVHe indicated that instant feedback
p296
aVturns teaching moments into learning outcomes.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe next big idea is gamification.
p299
aVYou know, all learners engage really well
p300
aVwith interactive videos and so on.
p301
aVYou know, they would sit down and shoot
p302
aValien spaceships all day long until they get it.
p303
aVSo we applied these gamification techniques to learning,
p304
aVand we can build these online laboratories.
p305
aVHow do you teach creativity? How do you teach design?
p306
aVWe can do this through online labs
p307
aVand use computing power
p308
aVto build these online labs.
p309
aVSo as this little video shows here,
p310
aVyou can engage students
p311
aVmuch like they design with Legos.
p312
aVSo here, the learners are building a circuit
p313
aVwith Lego-like ease.
p314
aVAnd this can also be graded by the computer.
p315
aa(lp316
VFifth is peer learning.
p317
aVSo here, we use discussion forums and discussions
p318
aVand Facebook-like interaction
p319
aVnot as a distraction,
p320
aVbut to really help students learn.
p321
aVLet me tell you a story.
p322
aVWhen we did our circuits course
p323
aVfor the 155,000 students,
p324
aVI didn't sleep for three nights
p325
aVleading up to the launch of the course.
p326
aVI told my TAs, okay, 24/7,
p327
aVwe're going to be up
p328
aVmonitoring the forum, answering questions.
p329
aVThey had answered questions for 100 students.
p330
aVHow do you do that for 150,000?
p331
aVSo one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,
p332
aVand I think there's this question
p333
aVfrom a student from Pakistan,
p334
aVand he asked a question, and I said,
p335
aVokay, let me go and type up an answer,
p336
aVI don't type all that fast,
p337
aVand I begin typing up the answer,
p338
aVand before I can finish,
p339
aVanother student from Egypt popped in with an answer,
p340
aVnot quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,
p341
aVand before I can finish, a student from the U.S.
p342
aVhad popped in with a different answer.
p343
aVAnd then I sat back, fascinated.
p344
aVBoom, boom, boom, boom, the students were
p345
aVdiscussing and interacting with each other,
p346
aVand by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,
p347
aVhaving this epiphany,
p348
aVand by 4 a.m. in the morning,
p349
aVthey had discovered the right answer.
p350
aVAnd all I had to do was go and bless it,
p351
aV"Good answer."
p352
aVSo this is absolutely amazing,
p353
aVwhere students are learning from each other,
p354
aVand they're telling us that they are learning
p355
aVby teaching.
p356
aa(lp357
VNow this is all not just in the future.
p358
aVThis is happening today.
p359
aVSo we are applying these blended learning pilots
p360
aVin a number of universities and  high schools around the world,
p361
aVfrom Tsinghua in China
p362
aVto the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia
p363
aVto Berkeley in California \u2014
p364
aVall over the world.
p365
aVAnd these kinds of technologies really help,
p366
aVthe blended model can really help
p367
aVrevolutionize education.
p368
aVIt can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,
p369
aVthe business aspect.
p370
aVWe can also license these MOOC courses
p371
aVto other universities,
p372
aVand therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,
p373
aVwhere the university that licenses it with the professor
p374
aVcan use these online courses
p375
aVlike the next-generation textbook.
p376
aVThey can use as much or as little as they like,
p377
aVand it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.
p378
aa(lp379
VFinally, I would like to have you
p380
aVdream with me for a little bit.
p381
aVI would like us to really reimagine education.
p382
aVWe will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.
p383
aVWe have to move from books to tablets
p384
aVlike the Aakash in India
p385
aVor the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.
p386
aVThe Aakash is 40 dollars.
p387
aVWe have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings
p388
aVto digital dormitories.
p389
aa(lp390
VBut I think at the end of the day,
p391
aVI think we will still need one lecture hall
p392
aVin our universities.
p393
aVOtherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren
p394
aVthat your grandparents sat in that room
p395
aVin neat little rows like cornstalks
p396
aVand watched this professor at the end
p397
aVtalk about content and, you know,
p398
aVyou didn't even have a rewind button?
p399
aa(lp400
VThank you.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Applause)
p403
aa(lp404
VThank you. Thank you. (Applause)
