VSo my name is Taylor Wilson.
p4
aVI am 17 years old
p5
aVand I am a nuclear physicist,
p6
aVwhich may be a little hard to believe, but I am.
p7
aVAnd I would like to make the case
p8
aVthat nuclear fusion
p9
aVwill be that point,
p10
aVthat the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about
p11
aVwill get us to.
p12
aVSo nuclear fusion is our energy future.
p13
aVAnd the second point,
p14
aVmaking the case that kids can really change the world.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo you may ask \u2014
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aVYou may ask me,
p19
aVwell how do you know what our energy future is?
p20
aVWell I built a fusion reactor
p21
aVwhen I was 14 years old.
p22
aVThat is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.
p23
aVI started building this project
p24
aVwhen I was about 12 or 13 years old.
p25
aVI decided I wanted to make a star.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow most of you are probably saying,
p28
aVwell there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.
p29
aVI don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.
p30
aVWell it doesn't break even.
p31
aVIt doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,
p32
aVbut it still does some pretty cool stuff.
p33
aVAnd I assembled this in my garage,
p34
aVand it now lives in the physics department
p35
aVof the University of Nevada, Reno.
p36
aVAnd it slams together deuterium,
p37
aVwhich is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.
p38
aVSo this is similar to the reaction
p39
aVof the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.
p40
aVAnd I'm slamming it together so hard
p41
aVthat that hydrogen fuses together,
p42
aVand in the process it has some byproducts,
p43
aVand I utilize those byproducts.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo this previous year,
p46
aVI won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
p47
aVI developed a detector that replaces the current detectors
p48
aVthat Homeland Security has.
p49
aVFor hundreds of dollars,
p50
aVI've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity
p51
aVof detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.
p52
aVI built this in my garage.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Applause)
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd I've developed a system
p57
aVto produce medical isotopes.
p58
aVInstead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities
p59
aVI've developed a device that, on a very small scale,
p60
aVcan produce these isotopes.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo that's my fusion reactor in the background there.
p63
aVThat is me at the control panel
p64
aVof my fusion reactor.
p65
aVOh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,
p66
aVso my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.
p67
aVSo maybe I don't want to admit to that.
p68
aVThis is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,
p69
aVwhich is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.
p70
aVAnd this is me with President Obama,
p71
aVshowing him my Homeland Security research.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo in about seven years
p76
aVof doing nuclear research,
p77
aVI started out with a dream
p78
aVto make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,
p79
aVand I ended up meeting the president
p80
aVand developing things that I think can change the world,
p81
aVand I think other kids can too.
p82
aVSo thank you very much.
