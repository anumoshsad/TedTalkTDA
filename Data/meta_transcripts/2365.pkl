VA year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
p4
aVto present our art projects.
p5
aVWe are used to invitations, but this invitation really thrilled us.
p6
aVThe Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.
p7
aVIt is the only old building in the government district
p8
aVthat was not destroyed during the Second World War,
p9
aVand it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery.
p10
aVNo one is closer to Chancellor Merkel than the Swiss diplomats.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VThe government district in Berlin also contains the Reichstag \u2014
p15
aVGermany's parliament \u2014 and the Brandenburg Gate,
p16
aVand right next to the gate there are other embassies,
p17
aVin particular the US and the British Embassy.
p18
aa(lp19
VAlthough Germany is an advanced democracy,
p20
aVcitizens are limited in their constitutional rights
p21
aVin its government district.
p22
aVThe right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there.
p23
aVAnd this is interesting from an artistic point of view.
p24
aVThe opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself
p25
aVare always bound to a certain order
p26
aVand always subject to a specific regulation.
p27
aVWith an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations,
p28
aVwe can gain a new perspective.
p29
aVThe given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions
p30
aVand our lives.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd this is crucial in another context.
p33
aVOver the last couple of years,
p34
aVwe learned that from the roofs of the US and the British Embassy,
p35
aVthe secret services have been listening to the entire district,
p36
aVincluding the mobile phone of Angela Merkel.
p37
aVThe antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome,
p38
aVwhile the listening post of the American NSA
p39
aVis covered by radio transparent screens.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut how to address these hidden and disguised forces?
p42
aVWith my colleague, Christoph Wachter,
p43
aVwe accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy.
p44
aVAnd we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation.
p45
aa(lp46
VIf people are spying on us, it stands to reason
p47
aVthat they have to listen to what we are saying.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VOn the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas.
p52
aVThey weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VThey were makeshift can antennas,
p57
aVnot camouflaged but totally obvious and visible.
p58
aVThe Academy of Arts joined the project,
p59
aVand so we built another large antenna on their rooftop,
p60
aVexactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VNever have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation.
p65
aVA helicopter circled over our heads
p66
aVwith a camera registering each and every move we made,
p67
aVand on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled.
p68
aVAlthough the government district is governed by a strict police order,
p69
aVthere are no specific laws relating to digital communication.
p70
aVOur installation was therefore perfectly legal,
p71
aVand the Swiss Ambassador informed Chancellor Merkel about it.
p72
aVWe named the project "Can You Hear Me?"
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VThe antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network
p77
aVin which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate
p78
aVusing any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance,
p79
aVand be able to send messages
p80
aVto those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted.
p81
aVText messages, voice chat, file sharing \u2014
p82
aVanything could be sent anonymously.
p83
aVAnd people did communicate.
p84
aVOver 15,000 messages were sent.
p85
aVHere are some examples.
p86
aa(lp87
V"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ."
p88
aa(lp89
V"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"
p90
aa(lp91
V"This is the NSA. In God we trust. All others we track!!!!!"
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
V"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations.
p96
aV# expect us. We will #shutdown"
p97
aa(lp98
V"This is the NSA's Achilles heel. Open Networks."
p99
aa(lp100
V"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"
p101
aa(lp102
V"@NSA My neighbors are noisy. Please send a drone strike."
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V"Make Love, Not cyberwar."
p107
aa(lp108
VWe invited the embassies and the government departments
p109
aVto participate in the open network, too,
p110
aVand to our surprise, they did.
p111
aVFiles appeared on the network, including classified documents
p112
aVleaked from the parliamentary investigation commission,
p113
aVwhich highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information
p114
aVis starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament.
p115
aVWe also organized guided tours to experience and sound out
p116
aVthe power constellations on-site.
p117
aVThe tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies,
p118
aVand we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication.
p119
aa(lp120
VIf we become aware of the constellation,
p121
aVthe terms and conditions of communication,
p122
aVit not only broadens our horizon,
p123
aVit allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our worldview,
p124
aVour specific social, political or aesthetic conventions.
p125
aa(lp126
VLet's look at an actual example.
p127
aVThe fate of people living in the makeshift settlements
p128
aVon the outskirts of Paris
p129
aVis hidden and faded from view.
p130
aVIt's a vicious circle.
p131
aVIt's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new.
p132
aVWhat is new is how these realities are hidden
p133
aVand how people are made invisible
p134
aVin an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange.
p135
aVSuch makeshift settlements are considered illegal,
p136
aVand therefore those living in them don't have a chance
p137
aVof making their voices heard.
p138
aVOn the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible,
p139
aVmerely gives grounds for further persecution,
p140
aVexpulsion and suppression.
p141
aVWhat interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side.
p142
aVWe were searching for an interface and we found one.
p143
aVIt's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel.
p144
aa(lp145
VWe named the project "Hotel Gelem."
p146
aVTogether with Roma families, we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,
p147
aVfor example, in Freiburg in Germany, in Montreuil near Paris,
p148
aVand also in the Balkans.
p149
aVThese are real hotels.
p150
aVPeople can stay there.
p151
aVBut they aren't a commercial enterprise.
p152
aVThey are a symbol.
p153
aVYou can go online and ask for a personal invitation
p154
aVto come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,
p155
aVeating, working and living with the Roma families.
p156
aVHere, the Roma families are not the travelers;
p157
aVthe visitors are.
p158
aVHere, the Roma families are not a minority;
p159
aVthe visitors are.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe point is not to make judgments,
p162
aVbut rather to find out about the context that determines
p163
aVthese disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions.
p164
aVIn the world of globalization,
p165
aVthe continents are drifting closer to each other.
p166
aVCultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange,
p167
aVbut at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged
p168
aVand the world of the excluded is growing.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe were recently in Australia.
p171
aVFor us, it was no problem to enter the country.
p172
aVWe have European passports, visas and air tickets.
p173
aVBut asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia
p174
aVare deported or taken to prison.
p175
aVThe interception of the boats
p176
aVand the disappearance of the people into the detention system
p177
aVare veiled by the Australian authorities.
p178
aVThese procedures are declared to be secret military operations.
p179
aVAfter dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones,
p180
aVmen, women and children are detained by Australia without trial,
p181
aVsometimes for years.
p182
aa(lp183
VDuring our stay, however,
p184
aVwe managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,
p185
aVdespite strict screening and isolation.
p186
aVFrom these contexts was born an installation in the art space
p187
aVof the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.
p188
aa(lp189
VOn the face of it, it was a very simple installation.
p190
aVOn the floor, a stylized compass gave the direction
p191
aVto each immigration detention center,
p192
aVaccompanied by the distance and the name of the immigration facility.
p193
aVBut the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity.
p194
aVAbove every floor marking, there was a headset.
p195
aVVisitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee
p196
aVwho was or had been imprisoned
p197
aVin a specific detention facility
p198
aVand engage in a personal conversation.
p199
aVIn the protected context of the art exhibition,
p200
aVasylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves,
p201
aVtheir story and their situation, without fear of consequences.
p202
aVVisitors immersed themselves in long conversations
p203
aVabout families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones,
p204
aVabout suicide attempts,
p205
aVabout the fate of children in detention.
p206
aVEmotions ran deep. Many wept.
p207
aVSeveral revisited the exhibition.
p208
aVIt was a powerful experience.
p209
aa(lp210
VEurope is now facing a stream of migrants.
p211
aVThe situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies
p212
aVand the temptation of militarized responses.
p213
aVWe have also established communication systems
p214
aVin remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece.
p215
aVThey are all about providing basic information \u2014 weather forecasts,
p216
aVlegal information, guidance.
p217
aVBut they are significant.
p218
aVInformation on the Internet
p219
aVthat could ensure survival along dangerous routes
p220
aVis being censored,
p221
aVand the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized.
p222
aa(lp223
VThis brings us back to our network and to the antennas
p224
aVon the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
p225
aVand the "Can You Hear Me?" project.
p226
aVWe should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected.
p227
aVWe should start making our own connections,
p228
aVfighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world.
p229
aVThis is essential to overcome our speechlessness
p230
aVand the separation provoked by rival political forces.
p231
aVIt is only in truly exposing ourselves
p232
aVto the transformative power of this experience
p233
aVthat we can overcome prejudice and exclusion.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.
p240
aVThe other half of your artistic duo is also here.
p241
aVChristoph Wachter, come onstage.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Applause)
p244
aa(lp245
VFirst, tell me just a detail:
p246
aVthe name of the hotel is not a random name.
p247
aVGelem means something specific in the Roma language.
p248
aa(lp249
VMathias Jud: Yes, "Gelem, Gelem" is the title of the Romani hymn,
p250
aVthe official, and it means "I went a long way."
p251
aa(lp252
VBG: That's just to add the detail to your talk.
p253
aVBut you two traveled to the island of Lesbos
p254
aVvery recently, you're just back a couple of days ago,
p255
aVin Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving
p256
aVand have been arriving over the last few months.
p257
aVWhat did you see there and what did you do there?
p258
aa(lp259
VChristoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey,
p260
aVand during our stay,
p261
aVmany asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies,
p262
aVand after landing, they were left completely on their own.
p263
aVThey are denied many services.
p264
aVFor example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket
p265
aVor to rent a hotel room,
p266
aVso many families literally sleep in the streets.
p267
aVAnd we installed networks there to allow basic communication,
p268
aVbecause I think, I believe,
p269
aVit's not only that we have to speak about the refugees,
p270
aVI think we need to start talking to them.
p271
aVAnd by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings,
p272
aVabout their lives and their struggle to survive.
p273
aa(lp274
VBG: And allow them to talk as well.
p275
aVChristoph, thank you for coming to TED.
p276
aVMathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story.
