VMy name is Dan Cohen and I am an academic, as he said.
p4
aVAnd what that means is that I argue.
p5
aVIt's an important part of my life.
p6
aVAnd I like to argue.
p7
aVAnd I'm not just an academic, I'm a philosopher,
p8
aVso I like to think that I'm actually pretty good at arguing.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut I also like to think a lot about arguing.
p11
aVAnd in thinking about arguing, I've come across some puzzles.
p12
aVAnd one of the puzzles is that,
p13
aVas I've been thinking about arguing over the years \u2014
p14
aVand it's been decades now \u2014
p15
aVI've gotten better at arguing.
p16
aVBut the more that I argue and the better I get at arguing,
p17
aVthe more that I lose.
p18
aVAnd that's a puzzle.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd the other puzzle is that I'm actually okay with that.
p21
aVWhy is it that I'm okay with losing
p22
aVand why is it that I think good arguers are actually better at losing?
p23
aVWell, there are some other puzzles.
p24
aVOne is: why do we argue?
p25
aVWho benefits from arguments?
p26
aVWhen I think about arguments, I'm talking about \u2014
p27
aVlet's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments \u2014
p28
aVwhere something cognitive is at stake:
p29
aVIs this proposition true? Is this theory a good theory?
p30
aVIs this a viable interpretation of the data or the text? And so on.
p31
aVI'm not interested really in arguments about whose turn it is to do the dishes
p32
aVor who has to take out the garbage.
p33
aVYeah, we have those arguments, too.
p34
aVI tend to win those arguments, because I know the tricks.
p35
aVBut those aren't the important arguments.
p36
aVI'm interested in academic arguments,
p37
aVand here are the things that puzzle me.
p38
aa(lp39
VFirst, what do good arguers win when they win an argument?
p40
aVWhat do I win if I convince you
p41
aVthat utilitarianism isn't really the right framework
p42
aVfor thinking about ethical theories?
p43
aVWhat do we win when we win an argument?
p44
aVEven before that,
p45
aVwhat does it matter to me
p46
aVwhether you have this idea that Kant's theory works
p47
aVor Mill is the right ethicist to follow?
p48
aVIt's no skin off my back
p49
aVwhether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind.
p50
aVSo why do we even try to argue?
p51
aVWhy do we try to convince other people
p52
aVto believe things they don't want to believe,
p53
aVand is that even a nice thing to do?
p54
aVIs that a nice way to treat another human being,
p55
aVtry and make them think something they don't want to think?
p56
aVWell, my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe first model \u2014 let's call it the dialectical model \u2014
p59
aVis we think of arguments as war; you know what that's like \u2014
p60
aVa lot of screaming and shouting and winning and losing.
p61
aVThat's not a very helpful model for arguing,
p62
aVbut it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut there's a second model for arguing: arguments as proofs.
p65
aVThink of a mathematician's argument.
p66
aVHere's my argument. Does it work? Is it any good?
p67
aVAre the premises warranted? Are the inferences valid?
p68
aVDoes the conclusion follow from the premises?
p69
aVNo opposition, no adversariality \u2014
p70
aVnot necessarily any arguing in the adversarial sense.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut there's a third model to keep in mind
p73
aVthat I think is going to be very helpful,
p74
aVand that is arguments as performances, arguments in front of an audience.
p75
aVWe can think of a politician trying to present a position,
p76
aVtrying to convince the audience of something.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut there's another twist on this model that I really think is important;
p79
aVnamely, that when we argue before an audience,
p80
aVsometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument;
p81
aVthat is, arguments are also [performances] in front of juries,
p82
aVwho make a judgment and decide the case.
p83
aVLet's call this the rhetorical model,
p84
aVwhere you have to tailor your argument to the audience at hand.
p85
aVYou know, presenting a sound, well-argued,
p86
aVtight argument in English before a francophone audience
p87
aVjust isn't going to work.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo we have these models \u2014 argument as war, argument as proof
p90
aVand argument as performance.
p91
aVOf those three, the argument as war is the dominant one.
p92
aVIt dominates how we talk about arguments,
p93
aVit dominates how we think about arguments,
p94
aVand because of that, it shapes how we argue,
p95
aVour actual conduct in arguments.
p96
aVNow, when we talk about arguments,
p97
aVwe talk in a very militaristic language.
p98
aVWe want strong arguments, arguments that have a lot of punch,
p99
aVarguments that are right on target.
p100
aVWe want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order.
p101
aVWe want killer arguments.
p102
aVThat's the kind of argument we want.
p103
aVIt is the dominant way of thinking about arguments.
p104
aVWhen I'm talking about arguments,
p105
aVthat's probably what you thought of, the adversarial model.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut the war metaphor,
p108
aVthe war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments,
p109
aVhas, I think, deforming effects on how we argue.
p110
aVFirst, it elevates tactics over substance.
p111
aVYou can take a class in logic, argumentation.
p112
aVYou learn all about the subterfuges
p113
aVthat people use to try and win arguments \u2014 the false steps.
p114
aVIt magnifies the us-versus them aspect of it.
p115
aVIt makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.
p116
aVAnd the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph \u2014 glorious triumph \u2014
p117
aVor abject, ignominious defeat.
p118
aVI think those are deforming effects,
p119
aVand worst of all, it seems to prevent things like negotiation
p120
aVor deliberation or compromise or collaboration.
p121
aa(lp122
VThink about that one \u2014 have you ever entered an argument thinking,
p123
aV"Let's see if we can hash something out, rather than fight it out.
p124
aVWhat can we work out together?"
p125
aVI think the argument-as-war metaphor
p126
aVinhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd finally \u2014 this is really the worst thing \u2014
p129
aVarguments don't seem to get us anywhere; they're dead ends.
p130
aVThey are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in conversation.
p131
aVWe don't get anywhere.
p132
aVAnd one more thing.
p133
aVAnd as an educator, this is the one that really bothers me:
p134
aVIf argument is war,
p135
aVthen there's an implicit equation of learning with losing.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd let me explain what I mean.
p138
aVSuppose you and I have an argument.
p139
aVYou believe a proposition, P, and I don't.
p140
aVAnd I say, "Well, why do you believe P?"
p141
aVAnd you give me your reasons.
p142
aVAnd I object and say, "Well, what about ...?"
p143
aVAnd you answer my objection.
p144
aVAnd I have a question: "Well, what do you mean?
p145
aVHow does it apply over here?"
p146
aVAnd you answer my question.
p147
aVNow, suppose at the end of the day,
p148
aVI've objected, I've questioned,
p149
aVI've raised all sorts of counter counter-considerations
p150
aVand in every case you've responded to my satisfaction.
p151
aVAnd so at the end of the day, I say,
p152
aV"You know what? I guess you're right: P."
p153
aVSo, I have a new belief.
p154
aVAnd it's not just any belief;
p155
aVit's well-articulated, examined \u2014 it's a battle-tested belief.
p156
aa(lp157
VGreat cognitive gain.
p158
aVOK, who won that argument?
p159
aVWell, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won,
p160
aVeven though I'm the only one who made any cognitive gain.
p161
aVWhat did you gain, cognitively, from convincing me?
p162
aVSure, you got some pleasure out of it, maybe your ego stroked,
p163
aVmaybe you get some professional status
p164
aVin the field \u2014 "This guy's a good arguer."
p165
aVBut just from a cognitive point of view,
p166
aVwho was the winner?
p167
aVThe war metaphor forces us into thinking that you're the winner and I lost,
p168
aVeven though I gained.
p169
aVAnd there's something wrong with that picture.
p170
aVAnd that's the picture I really want to change if we can.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo, how can we find ways
p173
aVto make arguments yield something positive?
p174
aVWhat we need is new exit strategies for arguments.
p175
aVBut we're not going to have new exit strategies for arguments
p176
aVuntil we have new entry approaches to arguments.
p177
aVWe need to think of new kinds of arguments.
p178
aVIn order to do that, well \u2014
p179
aVI don't know how to do that.
p180
aVThat's the bad news.
p181
aVThe argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster.
p182
aVIt's just taken up habitation in our mind,
p183
aVand there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it.
p184
aVThere's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear.
p185
aVI don't have an answer.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut I have some suggestions.
p188
aVHere's my suggestion:
p189
aVIf we want to think of new kinds of arguments,
p190
aVwhat we need to do is think of new kinds of arguers.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo try this:
p193
aVThink of all the roles that people play in arguments.
p194
aVThere's the proponent and the opponent
p195
aVin an adversarial, dialectical argument.
p196
aVThere's the audience in rhetorical arguments.
p197
aVThere's the reasoner in arguments as proofs.
p198
aVAll these different roles.
p199
aVNow, can you imagine an argument in which you are the arguer,
p200
aVbut you're also in the audience, watching yourself argue?
p201
aVCan you imagine yourself watching yourself argue,
p202
aVlosing the argument, and yet still, at the end of the argument, saying,
p203
aV"Wow, that was a good argument!"
p204
aVCan you do that?
p205
aVI think you can, and I think if you can imagine that kind of argument,
p206
aVwhere the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say,
p207
aV"Yeah, that was a good argument,"
p208
aVthen you have imagined a good argument.
p209
aVAnd more than that,
p210
aVI think you've imagined a good arguer,
p211
aVan arguer that's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, I lose a lot of arguments.
p214
aVIt takes practice to become a good arguer,
p215
aVin the sense of being able to benefit from losing, but fortunately,
p216
aVI've had many, many colleagues who have been willing to step up
p217
aVand provide that practice for me.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
