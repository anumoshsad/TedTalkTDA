VThe youthful perspective on the future,
p4
aVthe present perspective on the future
p5
aVand the future, mature perspective on the future \u2014
p6
aVI'd like to try and bring all those three tenses together
p7
aVin one identity tonight.
p8
aVAnd you could say that the poet, in many ways,
p9
aVlooks at what I call "the conversational nature of reality."
p10
aVAnd you ask yourself:
p11
aVWhat is the conversational nature of reality?
p12
aVThe conversational nature of reality is the fact
p13
aVthat whatever you desire of the world \u2014
p14
aVwhatever you desire of your partner in a marriage or a love relationship,
p15
aVwhatever you desire of your children,
p16
aVwhatever you desire of the people who work for you or with you,
p17
aVor your world \u2014
p18
aVwill not happen exactly as you would like it to happen.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut equally,
p21
aVwhatever the world desires of us \u2014
p22
aVwhatever our partner, our child, our colleague,
p23
aVour industry,
p24
aVour future demands of us,
p25
aVwill also not happen.
p26
aVAnd what actually happens
p27
aVis this frontier between what you think is you
p28
aVand what you think is not you.
p29
aVAnd this frontier of actual meeting
p30
aVbetween what we call a self and what we call the world
p31
aVis the only place, actually, where things are real.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut it's quite astonishing,
p34
aVhow little time we spend at this conversational frontier,
p35
aVand not abstracted away from it in one strategy or another.
p36
aVI was coming through immigration,
p37
aVwhich is quite a dramatic border at the moment,
p38
aVinto the US last year,
p39
aVand, you know, you get off an international flight
p40
aVacross the Atlantic,
p41
aVand you're not in the best place;
p42
aVyou're not at your most spiritually mature.
p43
aVYou're quite impatient with the rest of humanity, in fact.
p44
aVSo when you get up to immigration with your shirt collar out
p45
aVand a day's growth of beard,
p46
aVand you have very little patience,
p47
aVand the immigration officer looked at my passport
p48
aVand said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"
p49
aVI said, "I work with the conversational nature of reality."
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd he leaned forward over his podium
p54
aVand he said, "I needed you last night."
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I said, "I'm sorry,
p61
aVmy powers as a poet and philosopher only go so far.
p62
aVI'm not sure I can \u2014"
p63
aVBut before we knew it,
p64
aVwe were into a conversation about his marriage.
p65
aVHere he was in his uniform,
p66
aVand the interesting thing was,
p67
aVhe was looking up and down the row of officers
p68
aVto make sure his supervisor didn't see
p69
aVthat we was having a real conversation.
p70
aVBut all of us live at this conversational frontier
p71
aVwith the future.
p72
aa(lp73
VI'd like to put you in the shoes of my Irish niece,
p74
aVMarlene McCormack,
p75
aVstanding on a cliff edge on the western coast of Spain,
p76
aVoverlooking the broad Atlantic.
p77
aVTwenty-three years old, she's just walked 500 miles
p78
aVfrom Saint Jean Pied de Port on the French side of the Pyrenees,
p79
aVall the way across Northern Spain,
p80
aVon this very famous, old and contemporary pilgrimage
p81
aVcalled the Camino de Santiago de Compostela \u2014
p82
aVthe Path to Santiago of Compostela.
p83
aVAnd when you get to Santiago, actually,
p84
aVit can be something of an anticlimax,
p85
aVbecause there are 100,000 people living there
p86
aVwho are not necessarily applauding you as you're coming into town.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd 10,000 of them are trying to sell you a memento of your journey.
p91
aVBut you do have the possibility of going on for three more days
p92
aVto this place where Marlene stood, called, in Spanish, Finisterre,
p93
aVin English, Finisterre,
p94
aVfrom the Latin, meaning "the ends of the earth,"
p95
aVthe place where ground turns to ocean;
p96
aVthe place where your present turns into the future.
p97
aVAnd Marlene had walked this way \u2014
p98
aVshe just graduated as a 23-year-old from the University of Sligo
p99
aVwith a degree in Irish drama.
p100
aVAnd she said to me, "I don't think the major corporations of the world
p101
aVwill be knocking on my door."
p102
aVI said, "Listen, I've worked in corporations all over the world
p103
aVfor decades;
p104
aVa degree in drama is what would most prepare you for the adult \u2014
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
Vcorporate world."
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VBut she said, "I'm not interested in that, anyway.
p113
aVI don't want to teach drama, I want to become a dramatist.
p114
aVI want to write plays.
p115
aVSo I walked the Camino in order to give myself some courage,
p116
aVin order to walk into my future."
p117
aVAnd I said, "What was the most powerful moment you had on the whole Camino,
p118
aVthe very most powerful moment?"
p119
aVShe said, "I had many powerful moments,
p120
aVbut you know, the most powerful moment was post-Camino,
p121
aVwas the three days you go on from Santiago and come to this cliff edge.
p122
aVAnd you go through three rituals.
p123
aVThe first ritual is to eat a tapas plate of scallops" \u2014
p124
aVor if you're vegetarian,
p125
aVto contemplate the scallop shell.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VBecause the scallop shell has been the icon and badge of your walk,
p130
aVand every arrow that you have seen along that way
p131
aVhas been pointing underneath a scallop shell.
p132
aVSo really, this first ritual is saying:
p133
aVHow did you get to this place?
p134
aVHow did you follow the path to get here?
p135
aVHow do you hold the conversation of life when you feel unbesieged,
p136
aVwhen you're unbullied,
p137
aVwhen you're left to yourself?
p138
aVHow do you hold the conversation of life that brings you to this place?
p139
aVAnd the second ritual is that you burn something that you've brought.
p140
aVI said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"
p141
aVShe said, "I burned a letter and two postcards."
p142
aVI said, "Astonishing.
p143
aVTwenty-three years old and you have paper.
p144
aVI can't believe it."
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VI'm sure there's a Camino app
p149
aVwhere you can just delete a traumatic text, you know?
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VIt will engage the flashlight,
p154
aVimbue it with color
p155
aVand disappear in a firework of flames.
p156
aVBut you either bring a letter or you write one there,
p157
aVand you burn it.
p158
aVAnd of course we know intuitively what is on those letters and postcards.
p159
aVIt's a form of affection and love that is now no longer extant, yeah?
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then the third ritual:
p162
aVbetween all these fires are large piles of clothes.
p163
aVAnd you leave an item of clothing
p164
aVthat has helped you to get to this place.
p165
aVAnd I said to Marlene, "What did you leave at the cliff edge?"
p166
aVShe said, "I left my boots \u2014
p167
aVthe very things that I walked in, actually.
p168
aVThey were beautiful boots, I loved those boots,
p169
aVbut they were finished after seven weeks of walking.
p170
aVSo I walked away in my trainers,
p171
aVbut I left my boots there."
p172
aa(lp173
VShe said, "It was really incredible.
p174
aVThe most powerful moment was, the sun was going down,
p175
aVbut the full moon was coming up behind me.
p176
aVAnd the full moon was illuminated by the dying sun in such a powerful way
p177
aVthat even after the sun had dropped below the horizon,
p178
aVthe moon could still see that sun.
p179
aVAnd I had a moon shadow,
p180
aVand I was looking at my moon shadow walking across the Atlantic,
p181
aVacross this ocean.
p182
aVAnd I thought,
p183
aV'Oh! That's my new self going into the future.'
p184
aVBut suddenly I realized the sun was falling further.
p185
aVThe moon was losing its reflection,
p186
aVand my shadow was disappearing.
p187
aVThe most powerful moment I had on the whole Camino
p188
aVwas when I realized I myself had to walk across that unknown sea
p189
aVinto my future."
p190
aa(lp191
VWell, I was so taken by this story,
p192
aVI wrote this piece for her.
p193
aVWe were driving at the time;
p194
aVwe got home, I sat on the couch,
p195
aVI wrote until two in the morning \u2014
p196
aVeveryone had gone to bed \u2014
p197
aVand I gave it to Marlene at breakfast time.
p198
aVIt's called, "Finisterre," for Marlene McCormack.
p199
aa(lp200
V"The road in the end
p201
aa(lp202
Vthe road in the end taking the path the sun had taken
p203
aa(lp204
Vthe road in the end taking the path the run had taken

p206
aa(lp207
Vthe road in the end taking the path the sun had taken

p209
aa(lp210

p214

Vno way to your future now
p216
aa(lp217

p218
aVexcept the way your shadow could take,
p219
aVwalking before you across water, going where shadows go,
p220
aa(lp221
Vno way to make sense of a world that wouldn't let you pass
p222
aVexcept to call an end to the way you had come,

p225
aVand to read them as they drifted on the late western light;

p228
aa(lp229
Vto empty your bags;
p230

p234
aa(lp235
Vto promise what you needed to promise all along,
p236

p237
aVright at the water's edge,

aa(lp239
Vnot because you had given up
p240
aa(lp241
Vnot because you had given up
p242
aVbut because now,
p243
aVyou would find a different way to tread,
p244
aVand because, through it all,
p245
aVpart of you would still walk on,
p246
aVno matter how,
p247
aVover the waves."
p248
aa(lp249
V"Finisterre."
p250
aVFor Marlene McCormack \u2014
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
Vwho has already had her third play performed
p255
aVin off-off-off-off-Broadway \u2014
p256
aVin Dublin.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut she's on her way.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is the last piece.
p263
aVThis is about the supposed arrival at the sum of all of our endeavors.
p264
aVIn Santiago itself \u2014
p265
aVit could be Santiago,
p266
aVit could be Mecca,
p267
aVit could be Varanasi,
p268
aVit could be Kyoto,
p269
aVit could be that threshold you've set for yourself,
p270
aVthe disturbing approach to the consummation of all your goals.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd one of the difficulties about walking into your life,
p273
aVabout coming into this body,
p274
aVinto this world fully,
p275
aVis you start to realize
p276
aVthat you have manufactured three abiding illusions
p277
aVthat the rest of humanity has shared with you since the beginning of time.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd the first illusion is that you can somehow construct a life
p280
aVin which you are not vulnerable.
p281
aVYou can somehow be immune to all of the difficulties
p282
aVand ill health and losses
p283
aVthat humanity has been subject to since the beginning of time.
p284
aVIf we look out at the natural world,
p285
aVthere's no part of that world
p286
aVthat doesn't go through cycles of, first, incipience,
p287
aVor hiddenness,
p288
aVbut then growth, fullness,
p289
aVbut then a beautiful, to begin with, disappearance,
p290
aVand then a very austere, full disappearance.
p291
aVWe look at that, we say, "That's beautiful,
p292
aVbut can I just have the first half of the equation, please?
p293
aVAnd when the disappearance is happening,
p294
aVI'll close my eyes and wait for the new cycle to come around."
p295
aVWhich means most human beings are at war with reality
p296
aV50 percent of the time.
p297
aVThe mature identity
p298
aVis able to live in the full cycle.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe second illusion is,
p301
aVI can construct a life in which I will not have my heart broken.
p302
aVRomance is the first place we start to do it.
p303
aVWhen you're at the beginning of a new romance or a new marriage,
p304
aVyou say, "I have found the person who will not break my heart."
p305
aVI'm sorry;
p306
aVyou have chosen them out unconsciously for that exact core competency.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VThey will break your heart.
p311
aVWhy?
p312
aVBecause you care about them.
p313
aVYou look at parenting, yeah?
p314
aVParenting: "I will be the perfect mother and father."
p315
aVYour children will break your heart.
p316
aVAnd they don't even have to do anything spectacular or dramatic.
p317
aVBut usually, they do do something spectacular or dramatic \u2014
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
Vto break your heart.
p322
aVAnd then they live with you as spies and saboteurs for years,
p323
aVwatching your every psychological move,
p324
aVand spotting your every weakness.
p325
aVAnd one day,
p326
aVwhen they're about 14 years old,
p327
aVwith your back turned to them,
p328
aVin the kitchen,
p329
aVwhile you're making something for them \u2014
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
Vthe psychological stiletto goes in.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd you say, "How did you know exactly where to place it?"
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd they say,
p344
aV"I've been watching you for \u2014
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
Va good few years."
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd then we hope that our armored, professional personalities
p351
aVwill prevent us from having our heart broken in work.
p352
aVBut if you're sincere about your work,
p353
aVit should break your heart.
p354
aVYou should get to thresholds
p355
aVwhere you do not know how to proceed.
p356
aVYou do not know how to get from here to there.
p357
aVWhat does that do?
p358
aVIt puts you into a proper relationship with reality.
p359
aVWhy?
p360
aVBecause you have to ask for help.
p361
aa(lp362
VHeartbreak.
p363
aVWe don't have a choice about heartbreak,
p364
aVwe only have a choice of having our hearts broken
p365
aVover people and things and projects that we deeply care about.
p366
aa(lp367
VAnd the last illusion is,
p368
aVI can somehow plan enough and arrange things
p369
aVthat I will be able to see the path to the end
p370
aVright from where I'm standing,
p371
aVright to the horizon.
p372
aVBut when you think about it,
p373
aVthe only environment in which that would be true
p374
aVwould be a flat desert,
p375
aVempty of any other life.
p376
aVBut even in a flat desert,
p377
aVthe curvature of the earth would take the path away from you.
p378
aVSo, no;
p379
aVyou see the path,
p380
aVand then you don't
p381
aVand then you see it again.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo this is "Santiago,"
p384
aVthe supposed arrival,
p385
aVwhich is a kind of return to the beginning all at the same time.
p386
aVWe have this experience of the journey,
p387
aVwhich is in all of our great spiritual traditions,
p388
aVof pilgrimage.
p389
aVBut just by actually standing in the ground of your life fully,
p390
aVnot trying to abstract yourself into a strategic future
p391
aVthat's actually just an escape from present heartbreak;
p392
aVthe ability to stand in the ground of your life
p393
aVand to look at the horizon that is pulling you \u2014
p394
aVin that moment,
p395
aVyou are the whole journey.
p396
aVYou are the whole conversation.
p397
aa(lp398
V"Santiago."
