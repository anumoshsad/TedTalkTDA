VGood morning, ladies and gentlemen.
p4
aVMy name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."
p5
aVWhat that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic
p6
aVto do something I call "mathemagics."
p7
aa(lp8
VBut before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.
p9
aVBy any chance, did anyone happen
p10
aVto bring with them this morning a calculator?
p11
aVSeriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.
p12
aVRaise your hand. Did your hand go up?
p13
aVNow bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?
p14
aVI see, I see one way in the back.
p15
aVYou sir, that's three.
p16
aVAnd anybody on this side here?
p17
aVOK, over there on the aisle.
p18
aVWould the four of you please bring out your calculators,
p19
aVthen join me up on stage.
p20
aVLet's give them a nice round of applause.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Applause)
p23
aa(lp24
VThat's right.
p25
aVNow, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators,
p26
aVI need to make sure that they are all working properly.
p27
aVWould somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?
p28
aVHow about a two-digit number?
p29
aa(lp30
VAudience: 22.
p31
aa(lp32
VAB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?
p33
aa(lp34
VAudience: 47.
p35
aa(lp36
VAB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034,
p37
aVor the calculators are not working.
p38
aVDo all of you get 1,034? 1,034?
p39
aa(lp40
VVolunteer: No.
p41
aa(lp42
VAB: 594. Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Applause)
p45
aa(lp46
VWould you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?
p47
aVOK, great.
p48
aVWhat I'm going to try and do then \u2014
p49
aVI notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
p50
aVThat's OK.
p51
aVI'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.
p52
aVThere is something called the square of a number,
p53
aVwhich most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.
p54
aVFor instance, five squared would be?
p55
aa(lp56
VAudience: 25.
p57
aa(lp58
VAB: 25. The way we can square on most calculators \u2014
p59
aVlet me demonstrate with this one \u2014
p60
aVis by taking the number, such as five,
p61
aVhitting "times" and then "equals,"
p62
aVand on most calculators that will give you the square.
p63
aVOn some of these ancient RPN calculators,
p64
aVyou've got an "x squared" button on it,
p65
aVwill allow you to do the calculation even faster.
p66
aVWhat I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head,
p67
aVfour two-digit numbers
p68
aVfaster than they can do on their calculators,
p69
aVeven using the shortcut method.
p70
aVWhat I'll use is the second row this time,
p71
aVand I'll get four of you
p72
aVto each yell out a two-digit number,
p73
aVand if you would square the first number,
p74
aVand if you would square the second, the third and the fourth,
p75
aVI will try and race you to the answer. OK?
p76
aVSo quickly, a two-digit number please.
p77
aa(lp78
VAudience: 37.
p79
aa(lp80
VArthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.
p81
aa(lp82
VAudience: 23.
p83
aa(lp84
VAB: 23 squared, OK.
p85
aa(lp86
VAudience: 59.
p87
aa(lp88
VAB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?
p89
aa(lp90
VAudience: 93.
p91
aa(lp92
VAB: 93 squared.
p93
aVWould you call out your answers, please?
p94
aa(lp95
VVolunteer: 1369. AB: 1369.
p96
aa(lp97
VVolunteer: 529. AB: 529.
p98
aa(lp99
VVolunteer: 3481. AB: 3481.
p100
aa(lp101
VVolunteer: 8649.
p102
aa(lp103
VAB: Thank you very much.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VLet me try to take this one step further.
p108
aVI'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
p109
aVI won't even write these down \u2014
p110
aVI'll just call them out as they're called out to me.
p111
aVAnyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.
p112
aVAnyone on our panel, verify the answer.
p113
aVJust give some indication if it's right.
p114
aVA three-digit number, sir, yes?
p115
aa(lp116
VAudience: 987.
p117
aa(lp118
VAB: 987 squared is 974,169.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VAB: Yes? Good.
p123
aVAnother three-digit \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
V(Applause)
p126
aV\u2014 another three-digit number, sir?
p127
aa(lp128
VAudience: 457.
p129
aa(lp130
VAB: 457 squared is 205,849.
p131
aV205,849?
p132
aVAB: Yes?
p133
aVOK, another, another three-digit number, sir?
p134
aa(lp135
VAudience: 321.
p136
aa(lp137
VAB: 321 is 103,041.
p138
aV103,041.
p139
aVYes? One more three-digit number please.
p140
aa(lp141
VAudience: Oh, 722.
p142
aa(lp143
VAB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.
p144
aVIs that 513,284?
p145
aa(lp146
VVolunteer: Yes.
p147
aa(lp148
VAB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please.
p149
aa(lp150
VAudience: 162.
p151
aV162 squared is 26,244.
p152
aa(lp153
VVolunteer: Yes.
p154
aa(lp155
VThank you very much.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause ends)
p160
aa(lp161
VLet me try to take this one step further.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VI'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.
p166
aVYou can all take your time on this;
p167
aVI will not beat you to the answer on this one,
p168
aVbut I will try to get the answer right.
p169
aVTo make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time,
p170
aVlet's say, one, two, three, four.
p171
aVIf each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine,
p172
aVthat will be the four-digit number that I'll square.
p173
aa(lp174
VNine.
p175
aa(lp176
VSeven.
p177
aa(lp178
VFive.
p179
aa(lp180
VEight.
p181
aV9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.
p182
aV95 million \u2014
p183
aa(lp184
V(Sighs)
p185
aV218,564?
p186
aa(lp187
VVolunteer: Yes!
p188
aa(lp189
VAB: Thank you very much.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause ends)
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, I would attempt to square a five-digit number \u2014
p196
aVand I can \u2014
p197
aVbut unfortunately, most calculators cannot.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VEight-digit capacity \u2014 don't you hate that?
p202
aVSo, since we've reached the limits of our calculators \u2014
p203
aVwhat's that?
p204
aVDoes yours go higher?
p205
aa(lp206
VVolunteer: I don't know.
p207
aa(lp208
VAB: Oh, yours does?
p209
aa(lp210
VVolunteer: I can probably do it. AB: I'll talk to you later.
p211
aVIn the meanwhile, let me conclude
p212
aVthe first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.
p213
aVLet's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.
p214
aVWould you each enter that on your calculator?
p215
aVAnd instead of squaring it this time,
p216
aVI want you to take that number and multiply it
p217
aVby any three-digit number that you want,
p218
aVbut don't tell me what you're multiplying by \u2014
p219
aVjust multiply it by any random three-digit number.
p220
aVSo you should have as an answer either
p221
aVa six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
p222
aVHow many digits do you have, six or seven?
p223
aa(lp224
VSeven, and yours?
p225
aa(lp226
VSeven? Seven?
p227
aVAnd, uncertain.
p228
aa(lp229
VSeven.
p230
aVIs there any possible way that I could know
p231
aVwhat seven-digit numbers you have?
p232
aVSay "No."
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VGood, then I shall attempt the impossible \u2014
p237
aVor at least the improbable.
p238
aVWhat I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me
p239
aVany six of your seven digits, any six of them,
p240
aVin any order you'd like.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VOne digit at a time,
p245
aVI shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
p246
aVStarting with your seven-digit number,
p247
aVcall out any six of them please.
p248
aa(lp249
VVolunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.
p250
aa(lp251
VAB: Did you leave out the number 6?
p252
aa(lp253
VGood, OK, that's one.
p254
aVYou have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.
p255
aa(lp256
VVolunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.
p257
aa(lp258
VI think I only heard five numbers. I \u2014 wait \u2014 44875 \u2014
p259
aVdid you leave out the number 6?
p260
aa(lp261
VSame as she did, OK.
p262
aVYou've got a seven-digit number \u2014
p263
aVcall out any six of them loud and clear.
p264
aa(lp265
VVolunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.
p266
aa(lp267
VI think you left out the number 3?
p268
aa(lp269
VAB: That's three.
p270
aVThe odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing
p271
aVwould be one in 10,000: 10 to the fourth power.
p272
aVOK, any six of them.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VReally scramble them up this time, please.
p277
aa(lp278
VVolunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.
p279
aa(lp280
VDid you leave out the number 7?
p281
aVAnd let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.
p282
aVThank you very much.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
V(Applause ends)
p287
aVFor my next number \u2014
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
Vwhile I mentally recharge my batteries,
p292
aVI have one more question for the audience.
p293
aVBy any chance, does anybody here happen to know
p294
aVthe day of the week that they were born on?
p295
aVIf you think you know your birth day, raise your hand.
p296
aVLet's see, starting with \u2014 let's start with a gentleman first.
p297
aVWhat year was it, first of all?
p298
aVThat's why I pick a gentleman first.
p299
aa(lp300
VAudience: 1953.
p301
aa(lp302
V1953, and the month?
p303
aVNovember what?
p304
aV23rd \u2014 was that a Monday?
p305
aa(lp306
VAudience: Yes.
p307
aa(lp308
VGood. Somebody else?
p309
aVI haven't seen any women's hands up.
p310
aVOK, how about you, what year?
p311
aV1949, and the month?
p312
aVOctober what?
p313
aVFifth \u2014 was that a Wednesday?
p314
aVYes! I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?
p315
aVYell it out, what year?
p316
aa(lp317
VAudience: 1959.
p318
aa(lp319
V1959, OK \u2014 and the month?
p320
aa(lp321
VAudience: February.
p322
aVFebruary what?
p323
aa(lp324
VSixth \u2014 was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.
p325
aa(lp326
VGood, how about the person behind her?
p327
aVCall out, what year was it?
p328
aa(lp329
VAudience: 1947. AB: 1947, and the month?
p330
aa(lp331
VAudience: May. AB: May what?
p332
aa(lp333
VSeventh \u2014 would that be a Wednesday?
p334
aa(lp335
VAudience: Yes. AB: Thank you very much.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
p340
aVWe can do it that way.
p341
aVOf course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know,
p342
aVso I come prepared for that.
p343
aVI brought with me a book of calendars.
p344
aVIt goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VI didn't mean to look at you, sir \u2014 you were just sitting there.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VAnyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind.
p353
aVThis is a book of calendars.
p354
aVWho wanted to know their birth day?
p355
aVWhat year was it, first of all?
p356
aa(lp357
VAudience: 1966.
p358
aa(lp359
V66 \u2014 turn to the calendar with 1966.
p360
aVAnd what month?
p361
aa(lp362
VAudience: April. AB: April what?
p363
aa(lp364
VAudience: 17th.
p365
aa(lp366
VI believe that was a Sunday.
p367
aVCan you confirm, Chris?
p368
aa(lp369
VChris Anderson: Yes.
p370
aa(lp371
VAB: I'll tell you what, Chris:
p372
aVas long as you have that book in front of you,
p373
aVdo me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s,
p374
aVeither into the 1800s or way into the 2000s \u2014
p375
aVthat'll be a much greater challenge for me.
p376
aVAB: What year would you like? CA: 1824.
p377
aa(lp378
VAB: 1824, OK.
p379
aVAB: And what month?
p380
aa(lp381
VCA: June.
p382
aa(lp383
VAB: June what? CA: Sixth.
p384
aa(lp385
VAB: Was that a Sunday?
p386
aa(lp387
VCA: It was. AB: And it was cloudy.
p388
aa(lp389
V(Laughter)
p390
aa(lp391
VGood, thank you very much.
p392
aa(lp393
V(Applause)
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause ends)
p396
aa(lp397
VBut I'd like to wrap things up now
p398
aVby alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.
p399
aVThere was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
p400
aVWhere is he, would you stand up,
p401
aV10-digit guy?
p402
aVOK, stand up for me just for a second,
p403
aVso I can see where you are.
p404
aVYou have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?
p405
aVOK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head
p406
aVa five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.
p407
aVBut to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,
p408
aVI'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.
p409
aVSo you can actually, honestly hear
p410
aVwhat's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.
p413
aVI know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets,
p414
aVbut I'm not too afraid
p415
aVthat people are going to start doing my show next week, so \u2014
p416
aVI think we're OK.
p417
aa(lp418
V(Laughter)
p419
aa(lp420
V(Applause)
p421
aa(lp422
VSo, let's see,
p423
aVlet's take a different row of people, starting with you.
p424
aVI'll get five digits: one, two, three, four.
p425
aVOh, I did this row already.
p426
aVLet's do the row before you,
p427
aVstarting with you: one, two, three, four, five.
p428
aVCall out a single digit \u2014
p429
aVthat will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead.
p430
aa(lp431
VFive.
p432
aa(lp433
VSeven.
p434
aa(lp435
VSix.
p436
aa(lp437
VEight.
p438
aa(lp439
VThree.
p440
aV57,683 \u2014
p441
aVsquared.
p442
aVYuck.
p443
aa(lp444
VLet me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.
p445
aVI'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
p446
aVI'll do 57,000 squared,
p447
aVplus 683 squared,
p448
aVplus 57,000 times 683 times two.
p449
aVAdd all those numbers together,
p450
aVand with any luck, arrive at the answer.
p451
aVNow, let me recap.
p452
aa(lp453
V(Laughter)
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VWhile I explain something else \u2014
p460
aa(lp461
V(Laughter)
p462
aa(lp463
V\u2014 I know, that you can use, right?
p464
aa(lp465
V(Laughter)
p466
aa(lp467
VWhile I do these calculations,
p468
aVyou might hear certain words,
p469
aVas opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation.
p470
aVLet me explain what that is.
p471
aVThis is a phonetic code,
p472
aVa mnemonic device that I use,
p473
aVthat allows me to convert numbers into words.
p474
aVI store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers.
p475
aVI know it sounds complicated; it's not.
p476
aVI don't want you to think you're seeing something out of "Rain Man."
p477
aa(lp478
V(Laughter)
p479
aa(lp480
VThere's definitely a method to my madness \u2014
p481
aVdefinitely, definitely.
p482
aVSorry.
p483
aa(lp484
V(Laughter)
p485
aa(lp486
VIf you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards,
p487
aVyou can talk to me then.
p488
aVBy the way, one last instruction,
p489
aVfor my judges with the calculators \u2014
p490
aVyou know who you are \u2014
p491
aVthere is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.
p492
aVIf I do, don't tell me what the mistake is;
p493
aVjust say, "you're close," or something like that,
p494
aVand I'll try and figure out the answer \u2014
p495
aVwhich could be pretty entertaining in itself.
p496
aVIf, however, I am right,
p497
aVwhatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?
p498
aa(lp499
V(Laughter)
p500
aa(lp501
VMake sure everybody knows that I got the answer right,
p502
aVbecause this is my big finish, OK.
p503
aVSo, without any more stalling,
p504
aVhere we go.
p505
aVI'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683.
p506
aV57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876,
p507
aVthat's 38,760 plus 171,
p508
aV38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.
p509
aV38,931; double that to get 77,862.
p510
aV77,862 becomes cookie fission,
p511
aVcookie fission is 77,822.
p512
aVThat seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
