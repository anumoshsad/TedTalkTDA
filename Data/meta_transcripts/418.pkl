VThese rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,
p4
aVand are responsible for much of what\u2019s gone on on our planet.
p5
aVThis is an example of a real meteorite,
p6
aVand you can see all the melting of the iron
p7
aVfrom the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,
p8
aVand just how much of it survives and melts.
p9
aVFrom a meteorite from space,
p10
aVwe\u2019re over here with an original Sputnik.
p11
aVThis is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.
p12
aVThis is not a copy.
p13
aVThe space age began 50 years ago in October,
p14
aVand that\u2019s exactly what Sputnik looked like.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd it wouldn\u2019t be fun to talk about the space age
p17
aVwithout seeing a flag that was carried
p18
aVto the moon and back, on Apollo 11.
p19
aVThe astronauts each got to carry
p20
aVabout ten silk flags in their personal kits.
p21
aVThey would bring them back and mount them.
p22
aVSo this has actually been carried to the moon
p23
aVand back.
p24
aVSo that\u2019s for fun.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe dawn of books is, of course, important.
p27
aVAnd it wouldn\u2019t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books
p28
aVwithout having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.
p29
aVYou can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg
p30
aVin 1455.
p31
aVBut what\u2019s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,
p32
aVis not the book.
p33
aVYou see, the book was not driven by reading.
p34
aVIn 1455, nobody could read.
p35
aVSo why did the printing press succeed?
p36
aVThis is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.
p37
aVSo you\u2019re looking here at one of the first printed books
p38
aVusing movable type in the history of man,
p39
aV550 years ago.
p40
aVWe are living at the age here at the end of the book,
p41
aVwhere electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut why is this so interesting? Here\u2019s the quick story.
p44
aVIt turns out that in the 1450s,
p45
aVthe Catholic Church needed money,
p46
aVand so they
p47
aVactually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,
p48
aVwhich were forgiveness\u2019s on pieces of paper.
p49
aVThey traveled all around Europe
p50
aVand sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.
p51
aVThey got you out of purgatory faster.
p52
aVAnd when the printing press was invented
p53
aVwhat they found was they could print indulgences,
p54
aVwhich was the equivalent of printing money.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 \u2014
p57
aVto print out thousands,
p58
aVand then hundreds of thousands,
p59
aVand then ultimately millions
p60
aVof single, small pieces of paper
p61
aVthat got you out of middle hell and into heaven.
p62
aVThat is why the printing press succeeded,
p63
aVand that is why Martin Luther
p64
aVnailed his 90 theses to the door:
p65
aVbecause he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok
p66
aVin printing out indulgences and selling them
p67
aVin every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo the printing press, ladies and gentlemen,
p70
aVwas driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses
p71
aVand had nothing to do with reading.
p72
aVMore tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library
p73
aVfor those of you that have asked for pictures.
p74
aVWe\u2019re going to have some tomorrow.
p75
aV(Applause)
p76
aa(lp77
VInstead of showing an object from the stage
p78
aVI\u2019m going to do something special for the first time.
p79
aVWe are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?
p80
aVSo, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
p81
aVYou\u2019re going to find out why in a minute,
p82
aVbecause when I went to see Eileen,
p83
aVthis is what I said I wanted to build.
p84
aa(lp85
VThis is the Library of Human Imagination.
p86
aVThe room itself is three stories tall.
p87
aVIn the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination
p88
aVthat are computer controlled.
p89
aVThe room is a theatre. It changes colors.
p90
aVAnd all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.
p91
aVIt\u2019s designed like an Escher print.
p92
aVHere is some of the lower level of the library,
p93
aVwhere the exhibits constantly change.
p94
aVYou can walk through. You can touch.
p95
aVYou can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.
p96
aVThere\u2019s my very own Saturn V.
p97
aVEverybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)
p98
aVSo you can see here in the lower level of the library
p99
aVthe books and the objects.
p100
aVIn the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.
p101
aVThere is a glass bridge that you walk across
p102
aVthat\u2019s suspended in space.
p103
aVSo it\u2019s a leap of imagination.
p104
aa(lp105
VHow do we create?
p106
aVPart of the question that I have answered is,
p107
aVis we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:
p108
aVwith human achievement, with history,
p109
aVwith the things that drive us and make us human \u2014
p110
aVthe passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,
p111
aVthe maps of space that we\u2019ve experienced,
p112
aVand ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo hopefully tomorrow I\u2019ll show
p115
aVone or two more objects from the stage,
p116
aVbut for today I just wanted to say thank you
p117
aVfor all the people that came and talked to us about it.
p118
aVAnd Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home
p119
aVand share it with the TED community.
p120
aV(Applause)
p121
aVTED is all about patterns in the clouds.
p122
aVIt\u2019s all about connections.
p123
aVIt\u2019s all about seeing things
p124
aVthat everybody else has seen before
p125
aVbut thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
p126
aVAnd that\u2019s really what discovery and imagination is all about.
p127
aa(lp128
VFor example, we can look
p129
aVat a DNA molecule model here.
p130
aVNone of us really have ever seen one,
p131
aVbut we know it exists because we\u2019ve been taught
p132
aVto understand this molecule.
p133
aVBut we can also look at an Enigma machine
p134
aVfrom the Nazis in World War II
p135
aVthat was a coding and decoding machine.
p136
aVNow, you might say, what does this have to do with this?
p137
aVWell, this is the code for life,
p138
aVand this is a code for death.
p139
aVThese two molecules
p140
aVcode and decode.
p141
aVAnd yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.
p142
aVBut once you\u2019ve seen them in a new way,
p143
aVyou realize that both of these things really are connected.
p144
aVAnd they\u2019re connected primarily because of this here.
p145
aa(lp146
VYou see, this is a human brain model, OK?
p147
aVAnd it\u2019s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.
p148
aVWe get to see a skull. But there it is.
p149
aVAll of imagination \u2014 everything that we think,
p150
aVwe feel, we sense \u2014 comes through the human brain.
p151
aVAnd once we create new patterns in this brain,
p152
aVonce we shape the brain in a new way,
p153
aVit never returns to its original shape.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd I\u2019ll give you a quick example.
p156
aVWe think about the Internet;
p157
aVwe think about information that goes across the Internet.
p158
aVAnd we never think about the hidden connection.
p159
aVBut I brought along here a lump of coal \u2014
p160
aVright here, one lump of coal.
p161
aVAnd what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?
p162
aVYou see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal
p163
aVto move one megabyte of information across the net.
p164
aVSo every time you download a file,
p165
aVeach megabyte is a lump of coal.
p166
aVWhat that means is, a 200-megabyte file
p167
aVlooks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?
p168
aVSo the next time you download a gigabyte,
p169
aVor two gigabytes, it\u2019s not for free, OK?
p170
aVThe connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,
p171
aVand to make everything we think possible, possible.
p172
aVThanks, Chris.
