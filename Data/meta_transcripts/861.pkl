VI want to talk about penguins today.
p4
aVBut first, I want to start by saying that
p5
aVwe need a new operating system,
p6
aVfor the oceans and for the Earth.
p7
aVWhen I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,
p8
aVthere were 3,000 people
p9
aVthat lived in the Galapagos.
p10
aVNow there are over 30,000.
p11
aVThere were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.
p12
aVNow, there are around a thousand trucks
p13
aVand buses and cars there.
p14
aVSo the fundamental problems that we face
p15
aVare overconsumption and too many people.
p16
aVIt's the same problems in the Galapagos,
p17
aVexcept, obviously,
p18
aVit's worse here, in some ways, than other places.
p19
aVBecause we've only doubled the population of the Earth
p20
aVsince the 1960s \u2014 a little more than doubled \u2014
p21
aVbut we have 6.7 billion people in the world,
p22
aVand we all like to consume.
p23
aVAnd one of the major problems that we have
p24
aVis our operating system
p25
aVis not giving us the proper feedback.
p26
aVWe're not paying the true
p27
aVenvironmental costs of our actions.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,
p30
aVlet me just say, that I had never
p31
aVcamped before.
p32
aVI had never lived alone
p33
aVfor any period of time,
p34
aVand I'd never slept with sea lions
p35
aVsnoring next to me all night.
p36
aVBut moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.
p37
aVPunta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,
p38
aVand we call it uninhabited
p39
aVbecause there are no people there.
p40
aVBut it's alive with life;
p41
aVit's hardly uninhabited.
p42
aVSo a lot has happened in the last 40 years,
p43
aa(lp44
Vand what I learned when I came to the Galapagos
p45
aVis the importance of wild places, wild things,
p46
aVcertainly wildlife,
p47
aVand the amazing qualities that penguins have.
p48
aVPenguins are real athletes:
p49
aVThey can swim 173 kilometers in a day.
p50
aVThey can swim at the same speed day and night \u2014
p51
aVthat's faster than any Olympic swimmer.
p52
aVI mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour
p53
aVand sustain it.
p54
aVBut what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,
p55
aVEmperor penguins can go down
p56
aVmore than 500 meters
p57
aVand they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.
p58
aVMagellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,
p59
aVthey can dive to about 90 meters
p60
aVand they can stay down for
p61
aVabout 4.6 minutes.
p62
aVHumans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.
p63
aVAnd I doubt anybody in this room
p64
aVcould really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
p65
aVYou have to train to be able to do that.
p66
aVSo penguins are amazing athletes.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe other thing is, I've never met anybody
p69
aVthat really doesn't say that they like penguins.
p70
aVThey're comical, they walk upright,
p71
aVand, of course, they're diligent.
p72
aVAnd, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
p73
aVSo they have all the criteria
p74
aVthat people normally like.
p75
aVBut scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.
p76
aVThey tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,
p77
aVand particularly the ocean.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis is a picture of a Galapagos penguin
p80
aVthat's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.
p81
aVAnd that's what I came to study.
p82
aVI thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,
p83
aVbut you already know
p84
aVpenguins are rare.
p85
aVThese are the rarest penguins in the world.
p86
aVWhy I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.
p87
aVBut the population has changed
p88
aVdramatically since I was first here.
p89
aVWhen I counted penguins for the first time
p90
aVand tried to do a census,
p91
aVwe just counted all the individual beaks that we could
p92
aVaround all these islands.
p93
aVWe counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,
p94
aVbut I know I can count 2,000.
p95
aVIf you go and do it now, the national parks
p96
aVcount about 500.
p97
aVSo we have a quarter of the penguins
p98
aVthat we did 40 years ago.
p99
aVAnd this is true of most of our living systems.
p100
aVWe have less than we had before,
p101
aVand most of them are in fairly steep decline.
p102
aVAnd I want to just show you a little bit about why.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Braying)
p105
aa(lp106
VThat's a penguin braying
p107
aVto tell you that
p108
aVit's important to pay attention to penguins.
p109
aVMost important of all,
p110
aVI didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.
p111
aVAnd you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there
p112
aVand you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.
p113
aVI fell in love with penguins,
p114
aVand it certainly has changed the rest of my life.
p115
aVWhat I found out I was studying
p116
aVis really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,
p117
aVthe most extreme variation.
p118
aVYou've heard about these El Ninos,
p119
aVbut this is the extreme that penguins all over the world
p120
aVhave to adapt to.
p121
aVThis is a cold-water event
p122
aVcalled La Nina.
p123
aVWhere it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.
p124
aVAnd so you can see this current coming up \u2014
p125
aVin this case, the Humboldt Current \u2014
p126
aVthat comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,
p127
aVand this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,
p128
aVthat upwells around the Galapagos.
p129
aVThat brings all the nutrients:
p130
aVWhen this is cold in the Galapagos,
p131
aVit's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen we have extreme El Nino events,
p134
aVyou see all this red,
p135
aVand you see no green
p136
aVout here around the Galapagos.
p137
aVThat means that there's no upwelling,
p138
aVand there's basically no food.
p139
aVSo it's a real desert
p140
aVfor not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
p141
aVthings die when there's no food.
p142
aVBut we didn't even know that that
p143
aVaffected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.
p144
aVAnd you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,
p145
aVand you're in the middle of an El Nino event
p146
aVand there are no penguins.
p147
aVThey're not breeding; they're not even around.
p148
aVI studied marine iguanas at that point.
p149
aVBut this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,
p152
aVat a place called Punta Tombo \u2014
p153
aVthe largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world
p154
aVdown here about 44 degrees south latitude \u2014
p155
aVyou see that there's great variation here.
p156
aVSome years, the cold water
p157
aVgoes all the way up to Brazil,
p158
aVand other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.
p159
aVSo the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,
p160
aVbut that is the kind of variation
p161
aVthat penguins have to live with,
p162
aVand it's not easy.
p163
aVSo when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,
p164
aVI didn't have any problems.
p165
aVThere were plenty of them.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis is a picture at Punta Tombo in February
p168
aVshowing all the penguins along the beach.
p169
aVI went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them
p170
aVand turning them into high fashion golf gloves,
p171
aVprotein and oil.
p172
aVFortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins
p173
aVand we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
p174
aVBut the population is declining
p175
aVand it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent
p176
aVsince 1987, when I started these surveys,
p177
aVin terms of number of active nests.
p178
aVHere, you can see where Punta Tombo is,
p179
aVand they breed in incredibly dense colonies.
p180
aVWe know this because of long-term science,
p181
aVbecause we have long-term studies there.
p182
aVAnd science is important in informing decision makers,
p183
aVand also in changing how we do
p184
aVand knowing the direction of change that we're going in.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society
p187
aVhas funded me along with a lot of individuals
p188
aVover the last 27 years
p189
aVto be able to produce these kinds of maps.
p190
aVAnd also, we know that it's not only
p191
aVGalapagos penguins that are in trouble,
p192
aVbut Magellanics and many other species of penguins.
p193
aVAnd so we have started a global penguin society
p194
aVto try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
p195
aVThis is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.
p196
aVPenguins don't like oil
p197
aVand they don't like to swim through oil.
p198
aVThe nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,
p199
aVthere's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.
p200
aVBut, in fact, when we went to Argentina,
p201
aVpenguins were often found
p202
aVtotally covered in oil.
p203
aVSo they were just minding their own business.
p204
aVThey ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.
p205
aVBecause when tankers carry oil
p206
aVthey have to have ballast at some point,
p207
aVso when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.
p208
aVWhen they come back, they actually dump
p209
aVthis oily ballast water into the ocean.
p210
aVWhy do they do that? Because it's cheaper,
p211
aVbecause they don't pay the real environmental costs.
p212
aVWe usually don't, and we want to start
p213
aVgetting the accounting system right
p214
aVso we can pay the real cost.
p215
aa(lp216
VAt first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.
p217
aVYou can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.
p218
aVWe have laws,
p219
aVand we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."
p220
aVSo we ended up spending nine years
p221
aVconvincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.
p222
aVIn some years, like this year, we found
p223
aVmore than 80 percent
p224
aVof the adult penguins dead on the beach
p225
aVwere covered in oil.
p226
aVThese little blue dots are the fledglings \u2014
p227
aVwe do this survey every March \u2014
p228
aVwhich means that they're only in the environment
p229
aVfrom January until March,
p230
aVso maybe three months at the most
p231
aVthat they could get covered in oil.
p232
aVAnd you can see, in some years over 60 percent
p233
aVof the fledglings were oiled.
p234
aa(lp235
VEventually, the government listened
p236
aVand, amazingly, they changed their laws.
p237
aVThey moved the tanker lanes
p238
aV40 kilometers farther off shore,
p239
aVand people are not doing as much illegal dumping.
p240
aVSo what we're seeing now
p241
aVis very few penguins are oiled.
p242
aVWhy are there even these penguins oiled?
p243
aVBecause we've solved the problem in Chubut province,
p244
aVwhich is like a state in Argentina
p245
aVwhere Punta Tombo is \u2014
p246
aVso that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline \u2014
p247
aVbut we haven't solved the problem
p248
aVin northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.
p249
aVSo now I want to show you that penguins are affected.
p250
aa(lp251
VI'm just going to talk about two things.
p252
aVThis is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study
p253
aVbecause I put satellite tags on the back
p254
aVof these Magellanic penguins.
p255
aVTry to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars
p256
aVto glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.
p257
aVBut we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.
p258
aVWe thought we needed a marine protected area
p259
aVof about 30 kilometers,
p260
aVand then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.
p261
aVAnd what the penguins show us \u2014
p262
aVand these are all the little dots
p263
aVfrom where the penguins' positions were
p264
aVfor penguins in incubation in 2003 \u2014
p265
aVand what you see is some of these individuals
p266
aVare going 800 kilometers away from their nests.
p267
aVSo that means as their mate
p268
aVis sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,
p269
aVthe other one is out there foraging,
p270
aVand the longer they have to stay gone,
p271
aVthe worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.
p272
aVAnd, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle
p273
aVand you can't raise a lot of chicks.
p274
aa(lp275
VHere you see in 2003 \u2014
p276
aVthese are all the dots of where the penguins are \u2014
p277
aVthey were raising a little over
p278
aVa half of a chick.
p279
aVHere, you can see in 2006,
p280
aVthey raised almost three quarters
p281
aVof a chick per nest,
p282
aVand you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;
p283
aVthey're not going as far away.
p284
aVThis past year, in 2009,
p285
aVyou can see that they're now raising
p286
aVabout a fourth of a chick,
p287
aVand some of these individuals are going
p288
aVmore than 900 kilometers away from their nests.
p289
aVSo it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,
p290
aVand then you get transferred
p291
aVto St. Louis,
p292
aVand your mate is not happy about this
p293
aVbecause you've got to pay airfare,
p294
aVbecause you're gone longer.
p295
aVThe same thing's true for penguins as well.
p296
aVAnd they're going about, on average now,
p297
aV40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe need to be able to get information out to the general public.
p300
aVAnd so we started a publication
p301
aVwith the Society for Conservation
p302
aVthat we think presents cutting-edge science
p303
aVin a new, novel way,
p304
aVbecause we have reporters that are good writers
p305
aVthat actually can distill the information
p306
aVand make it accessible to the general public.
p307
aVSo if you're interested in cutting-edge science
p308
aVand smarter conservation,
p309
aVyou should join with our 11 partners \u2014
p310
aVsome of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy \u2014
p311
aVand look at this magazine
p312
aVbecause we need to get information out about conservation
p313
aVto the general public.
p314
aa(lp315
VLastly I want to say that
p316
aVall of you, probably,
p317
aVhave had some relationship at some time in your life
p318
aVwith a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,
p319
aVand you recognized that those are individuals.
p320
aVAnd some of you consider them almost part of your family.
p321
aVIf you had a relationship with a penguin,
p322
aVyou'd see it in the same sort of way.
p323
aVThey're amazing creatures
p324
aVthat really change how you view the world
p325
aVbecause they're not that different from us:
p326
aVThey're trying to make a living,
p327
aVthey're trying to raise their offspring,
p328
aVthey're trying to get on and survive in the world.
p329
aa(lp330
VThis is Turbo the Penguin.
p331
aVTurbo's never been fed.
p332
aVHe met us and got his name
p333
aVbecause he started standing under
p334
aVmy diesel truck: a turbo truck,
p335
aVso we named him Turbo.
p336
aVTurbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,
p337
aVwe let him in and he comes in here.
p338
aVAnd I just wanted to show you
p339
aVwhat happened one day
p340
aVwhen Turbo brought in a friend.
p341
aVSo this is Turbo.
p342
aVHe's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,
p343
aVwhich he would do to a female penguin.
p344
aVAnd you can see, he's not trying to bite.
p345
aVThis guy has never been in before
p346
aVand he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?
p347
aVWhat is this guy doing?
p348
aVThis is really pretty weird."
p349
aVAnd you'll see soon
p350
aVthat my graduate student ...
p351
aVand you see, Turbo's pretty intent
p352
aVon his flipper patting.
p353
aVAnd now he's looking at the other guy,
p354
aVsaying, "You are really weird."
p355
aVAnd now look at this: not friendly.
p356
aVSo penguins really differ in their personalities
p357
aVjust like our dogs and our cats.
p358
aa(lp359
VWe're also trying to collect our information
p360
aVand become more technologically literate.
p361
aVSo we're trying to put that
p362
aVin computers in the field.
p363
aVAnd penguins are always involved in helping us
p364
aVor not helping us in one way or another.
p365
aVThis is a radio frequency ID system.
p366
aVYou put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin
p367
aVthat has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
p368
aVIt walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
p369
aa(lp370
VOkay, so here are a few penguins coming in.
p371
aVSee, this one's coming back to its nest.
p372
aVThey're all coming in at this time,
p373
aVwalking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.
p374
aVHere's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.
p375
aVShe's really rushing back, because it's hot,
p376
aVto try to feed her chicks.
p377
aVAnd then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
p378
aVLook how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.
p379
aVThen I realize that they're playing
p380
aVking of the box.
p381
aVThis is my box up here, and this is the system that works.
p382
aVYou can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,
p383
aVdoes not like that wire.
p384
aVHe unplugs the wire; we have no data.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VSo, they really are pretty amazing creatures.
p389
aVOK.
p390
aVMost important thing is:
p391
aVOnly you can change yourself,
p392
aVand only you can change the world
p393
aVand make it better, for people
p394
aVas well as penguins.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, thank you very much. (Applause)
