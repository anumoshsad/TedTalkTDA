VIt's 1878.
p4
aVSir Francis Galton gives a remarkable talk.
p5
aVHe's speaking to the anthropologic institute of Great Britain and Ireland.
p6
aVKnown for his pioneering work in human intelligence,
p7
aVGalton is a brilliant polymath.
p8
aVHe's an explorer,
p9
aVan anthropologist,
p10
aVa sociologist,
p11
aVa psychologist
p12
aVand a statistician.
p13
aVHe's also a eugenist.
p14
aVIn this talk,
p15
aVhe presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs
p16
aVand produce composite portraits.
p17
aVThis technique could be used to characterize different types of people.
p18
aVGalton thinks that if he combines photographs of violent criminals,
p19
aVhe will discover the face of criminality.
p20
aVBut to his surprise,
p21
aVthe composite portrait that he produces
p22
aVis beautiful.
p23
aa(lp24
VGalton's surprising finding raises deep questions:
p25
aVWhat is beauty?
p26
aVWhy do certain configurations of line and color and form excite us so?
p27
aVFor most of human history,
p28
aVthese questions have been approached using logic and speculation.
p29
aVBut in the last few decades,
p30
aVscientists have addressed the question of beauty
p31
aVusing ideas from evolutionary psychology and tools of neuroscience.
p32
aVWe're beginning to glimpse the why and the how of beauty,
p33
aVat least in terms of what it means for the human face and form.
p34
aVAnd in the process,
p35
aVwe're stumbling upon some surprises.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen it comes to seeing beauty in each other,
p38
aVwhile this decision is certainly subjective for the individual,
p39
aVit's sculpted by factors that contribute to the survival of the group.
p40
aVMany experiments have shown
p41
aVthat a few basic parameters contribute to what makes a face attractive.
p42
aVThese include averaging, symmetry and the effects of hormones.
p43
aVLet's take each one of these in turn.
p44
aa(lp45
VGalton's finding
p46
aVthat composite or average faces are typically more attractive
p47
aVthan each individual face that contributes to the average
p48
aVhas been replicated many times.
p49
aVThis laboratory finding fits with many people's intuitions.
p50
aVAverage faces represent the central tendencies of a group.
p51
aVPeople with mixed features represent different populations,
p52
aVand presumably harbor greater genetic diversity
p53
aVand adaptability to the environment.
p54
aVMany people find mixed-race individuals attractive
p55
aVand inbred families less so.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry.
p58
aVPeople generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones.
p59
aVDevelopmental abnormalities are often associated with asymmetries.
p60
aVAnd in plants, animals and humans,
p61
aVasymmetries often arise from parasitic infections.
p62
aVSymmetry, it turns out,
p63
aVis also an indicator of health.
p64
aVIn the 1930s,
p65
aVa man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz
p66
aVrecognized the importance of symmetry for beauty
p67
aVwhen he designed the beauty micrometer.
p68
aVWith this device,
p69
aVhe could measure minor asymmetric flaws
p70
aVwhich he could then make up for with products he sold from his company,
p71
aVnamed brilliantly after himself, Max Factor,
p72
aVwhich, as you know, is one of the world's most famous brands
p73
aVfor "make up."
p74
aa(lp75
VThe third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness
p76
aVis the effect of hormones.
p77
aVAnd here, I need to apologize for confining my comments
p78
aVto heterosexual norms.
p79
aVBut estrogen and testosterone play important roles
p80
aVin shaping features that we find attractive.
p81
aVEstrogen produces features that signal fertility.
p82
aVMen typically find women attractive
p83
aVwho have elements of both youth and maturity.
p84
aVA face that's too baby-like might mean that the girl is not yet fertile,
p85
aVso men find women attractive
p86
aVwho have large eyes, full lips and narrow chins
p87
aVas indicators of youth,
p88
aVand high cheekbones as an indicator of maturity.
p89
aa(lp90
VTestosterone produces features that we regard as typically masculine.
p91
aVThese include heavier brows,
p92
aVthinner cheeks
p93
aVand bigger, squared-off jaws.
p94
aVBut here's a fascinating irony.
p95
aVIn many species,
p96
aVif anything,
p97
aVtestosterone suppresses the immune system.
p98
aVSo the idea that testosterone-infused features are a fitness indicator
p99
aVdoesn't really make a whole lot of sense.
p100
aVHere, the logic is turned on its head.
p101
aVInstead of a fitness indicator,
p102
aVscientists invoke a handicap principle.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe most commonly cited example of a handicap
p105
aVis the peacock's tail.
p106
aVThis beautiful but cumbersome tail doesn't exactly help the peacock
p107
aVavoid predators
p108
aVand approach peahens.
p109
aVWhy should such an extravagant appendage evolve?
p110
aVEven Charles Darwin,
p111
aVin an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote
p112
aVthat the sight of the peacock's tail made him physically ill.
p113
aVHe couldn't explain it with his theory of natural selection,
p114
aVand out of this frustration,
p115
aVhe developed the theory of sexual selection.
p116
aa(lp117
VOn this account,
p118
aVthe display of the peacock's tail is about sexual enticement,
p119
aVand this enticement means it's more likely the peacock will mate
p120
aVand have offspring.
p121
aVNow, the modern twist on this display argument
p122
aVis that the peacock is also advertising its health to the peahen.
p123
aVOnly especially fit organisms can afford to divert resources
p124
aVto maintaining such an extravagant appendage.
p125
aVOnly especially fit men can afford the price that testosterone levies
p126
aVon their immune system.
p127
aVAnd by analogy, think of the fact
p128
aVthat only very rich men can afford to pay more than $10,000 for a watch
p129
aVas a display of their financial fitness.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, many people hear these kinds of evolutionary claims
p132
aVand think they mean that we somehow are unconsciously seeking mates
p133
aVwho are healthy.
p134
aVAnd I think this idea is probably not right.
p135
aVTeenagers and young adults are not exactly known for making decisions
p136
aVthat are predicated on health concerns.
p137
aVBut they don't have to be,
p138
aVand let me explain why.
p139
aa(lp140
VImagine a population
p141
aVin which people have three different kinds of preferences:
p142
aVfor green, for orange and for red.
p143
aVFrom their point of view,
p144
aVthese preferences have nothing to do with health;
p145
aVthey just like what they like.
p146
aVBut if it were also the case that these preferences are associated
p147
aVwith the different likelihood of producing offspring \u2014
p148
aVlet's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 \u2014
p149
aVthen in the first generation,
p150
aVthere would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red,
p151
aVand in each subsequent generation,
p152
aVthe proportion of greens increase,
p153
aVso that in 10 generations,
p154
aV98 percent of this population has a green preference.
p155
aVNow, a scientist coming in and sampling this population
p156
aVdiscovers that green preferences are universal.
p157
aVSo the point about this little abstract example
p158
aVis that while preferences for specific physical features
p159
aVcan be arbitrary for the individual,
p160
aVif those features are heritable
p161
aVand they are associated with a reproductive advantage,
p162
aVover time,
p163
aVthey become universal for the group.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo what happens in the brain when we see beautiful people?
p166
aVAttractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex
p167
aVin the back of the brain,
p168
aVan area called the fusiform gyrus,
p169
aVthat is especially tuned to processing faces,
p170
aVand an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex,
p171
aVthat is especially attuned to processing objects.
p172
aVIn addition,
p173
aVattractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers
p174
aVin the front and deep in the brain,
p175
aVand these include areas that have complicated names,
p176
aVlike the ventral striatum,
p177
aVthe orbitofrontal cortex
p178
aVand the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
p179
aVOur visual brain that is tuned to processing faces
p180
aVinteracts with our pleasure centers
p181
aVto underpin the experience of beauty.
p182
aa(lp183
VAmazingly, while we all engage with beauty,
p184
aVwithout our knowledge,
p185
aVbeauty also engages us.
p186
aVOur brains respond to attractive faces
p187
aVeven when we're not thinking about beauty.
p188
aVWe conducted an experiment in which people saw a series of faces,
p189
aVand in one condition,
p190
aVthey had to decide if a pair of faces were the same or a different person.
p191
aVEven in this condition,
p192
aVattractive faces drove neural activity robustly in their visual cortex,
p193
aVdespite the fact that they were thinking about a person's identity
p194
aVand not their beauty.
p195
aVAnother group similarly found automatic responses to beauty
p196
aVwithin our pleasure centers.
p197
aVTaken together, these studies suggest
p198
aVthat our brain automatically responds to beauty
p199
aVby linking vision and pleasure.
p200
aVThese beauty detectors, it seems,
p201
aVping every time we see beauty,
p202
aVregardless of whatever else we might be thinking.
p203
aa(lp204
VWe also have a "beauty is good" stereotype embedded in the brain.
p205
aVWithin the orbitofrontal cortex,
p206
aVthere's overlapping neural activity
p207
aVin response to beauty and to goodness,
p208
aVand this happens even when people aren't explicitly thinking
p209
aVabout beauty or goodness.
p210
aVOur brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good.
p211
aVAnd this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger
p212
aVfor the many social effects of beauty.
p213
aVAttractive people receive all kinds of advantages in life.
p214
aVThey're regarded as more intelligent,
p215
aVmore trustworthy,
p216
aVthey're given higher pay and lesser punishments,
p217
aVeven when such judgments are not warranted.
p218
aa(lp219
VThese kinds of observations reveal beauty's ugly side.
p220
aVIn my lab, we recently found
p221
aVthat people with minor facial anomalies and disfigurements
p222
aVare regarded as less good, less kind,
p223
aVless intelligent, less competent and less hardworking.
p224
aVUnfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.
p225
aVThis stereotype is probably exploited and magnified
p226
aVby images in popular media,
p227
aVin which facial disfigurement is often used as a shorthand
p228
aVto depict someone of villainous character.
p229
aVWe need to understand these kinds of implicit biases
p230
aVif we are to overcome them
p231
aVand aim for a society in which we treat people fairly,
p232
aVbased on their behavior and not on the happenstance of their looks.
p233
aa(lp234
VLet me leave you with one final thought.
p235
aVBeauty is a work in progress.
p236
aVThe so-called universal attributes of beauty
p237
aVwere selected for during the almost two million years of the Pleistocene.
p238
aVLife was nasty, brutish and a very long time ago.
p239
aVThe selection criteria for reproductive success from that time
p240
aVdoesn't really apply today.
p241
aa(lp242
VFor example,
p243
aVdeath by parasite is not one of the top ways that people die,
p244
aVat least not in the technologically developed world.
p245
aVFrom antibiotics to surgery,
p246
aVbirth control to in vitro fertilization,
p247
aVthe filters for reproductive success are being relaxed.
p248
aVAnd under these relaxed conditions,
p249
aVpreference and trait combinations are free to drift
p250
aVand become more variable.
p251
aVEven as we are profoundly affecting our environment,
p252
aVmodern medicine and technological innovation
p253
aVis profoundly affecting
p254
aVthe very essence of what it means to look beautiful.
p255
aVThe universal nature of beauty is changing
p256
aVeven as we're changing the universe.
