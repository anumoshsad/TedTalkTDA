VCan I say how delighted I am to be away
p4
aVfrom the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter)
p5
aa(lp6
VThis is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,
p7
aVher back ruined by napalm,
p8
aVand she awakened the conscience of the nation of America
p9
aVto begin to end the Vietnam War.
p10
aVThis is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl
p11
aVwho launched Live Aid in the 1980s,
p12
aV15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,
p13
aVand that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.
p14
aVThis is Tiananmen Square.
p15
aVA man before a tank became a picture
p16
aVthat became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.
p17
aVThis next is the Sudanese girl,
p18
aVa few moments from death,
p19
aVa vulture hovering in the background,
p20
aVa picture that went round the world
p21
aVand shocked people into action on poverty.
p22
aVThis is Neda, the Iranian girl
p23
aVwho was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran
p24
aVonly a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,
p25
aVof the YouTube generation.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd what do all these pictures and events have in common?
p28
aVWhat they have in common is what we see unlocks
p29
aVwhat we cannot see.
p30
aVWhat we see unlocks the invisible ties
p31
aVand bonds of sympathy that bring us together
p32
aVto become a human community.
p33
aVWhat these pictures demonstrate is that
p34
aVwe do feel the pain of others,
p35
aVhowever distantly.
p36
aVWhat I think these pictures demonstrate
p37
aVis that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.
p38
aVWhat these pictures demonstrate is
p39
aVthat there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,
p40
aVacross all continents \u2014 a moral sense that
p41
aVnot only do we share the pain of others,
p42
aVand believe in something bigger than ourselves
p43
aVbut we have a duty to act when we see things
p44
aVthat are wrong that need righted,
p45
aVsee injuries that need to be corrected,
p46
aVsee problems that need to be rectified.
p47
aa(lp48
VThere is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,
p49
aVgoing to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.
p50
aVBefore he arrived Ronald Reagan said \u2014
p51
aVand he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister \u2014
p52
aV"Isn\u2019t this man a communist?"
p53
aVThe reply was, "No, Mr President, he\u2019s an anti-communist."
p54
aVAnd Ronald Reagan said, "I don\u2019t care what kind of communist he is!"
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVRonald Reagan asked Olof Palme,
p57
aVthe Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,
p58
aV"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"
p59
aVHe said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."
p60
aVOur responsibility is to let everyone have the chance
p61
aVto realize their potential to the full.
p62
aa(lp63
VI believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic
p64
aVthat commands attention from people of every religion
p65
aVand every faith, and people of no faith.
p66
aVBut I think what's new is that we now have the capacity
p67
aVto communicate instantaneously across frontiers
p68
aVright across the world.
p69
aVWe now have the capacity to find common ground
p70
aVwith people who we will never meet,
p71
aVbut who we will meet through the Internet and through
p72
aVall the modern means of communication;
p73
aVthat we now have the capacity to organize
p74
aVand take collective action together
p75
aVto deal with the problem or an injustice
p76
aVthat we want to deal with;
p77
aVand I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,
p78
aVand it is the start of what I would call
p79
aVthe creation of a truly global society.
p80
aa(lp81
VGo back 200 years when the slave trade was
p82
aVunder pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.
p83
aVThey protested across Britain.
p84
aVThey won public opinion over a long period of time.
p85
aVBut it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.
p86
aVWhat could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown
p87
aVif they were able to use the modern means of communication
p88
aVto win people\u2019s hearts and minds?
p89
aa(lp90
VOr if you take Eglantyne Jebb,
p91
aVthe woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
p92
aVShe was so appalled by what was happening in Austria
p93
aVas a result of the First World War and what was happening to children
p94
aVwho were part of the defeated families of Austria,
p95
aVthat in Britain she wanted to take action,
p96
aVbut she had to go house to house,
p97
aVleaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally
p98
aVin the Royal Albert Hall
p99
aVthat eventually gave birth to Save the Children,
p100
aVan international organization that is now fully recognized
p101
aVas one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.
p102
aVBut what more could she have done
p103
aVif she\u2019d had the modern means of communications available to her
p104
aVto create a sense that the injustice that people saw
p105
aVhad to be acted upon immediately?
p106
aa(lp107
VNow look at what\u2019s happened in the last 10 years.
p108
aVIn Philippines in 2001, President Estrada \u2014
p109
aVa million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,
p110
aVeventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)
p111
aVThen you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
p112
aVBecause people were able to take mobile phone photographs
p113
aVof what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible
p114
aVfor that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.
p115
aVOr take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,
p116
aVa country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs
p117
aVtold the world that there was a repression,
p118
aVmeaning that lives were being lost
p119
aVand people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,
p120
aVwho is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,
p121
aVhad to be listened to.
p122
aVThen take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:
p123
aVfollowing what happened to Neda,
p124
aVpeople who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people
p125
aVwho are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,
p126
aVchanging their address to Tehran, Iran,
p127
aVand making it difficult for the security services.
p128
aa(lp129
VTake, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:
p130
aVthe power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications
p131
aVand our ability to organize internationally.
p132
aa(lp133
VThat, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community
p134
aVto fundamentally change the world.
p135
aVForeign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;
p136
aVit\u2019s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,
p137
aVwho are communicating with each other around the world.
p138
aV200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
p139
aV150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours
p140
aVwas how young people, children, had the right to education.
p141
aV100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
p142
aV50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.
p143
aVIn the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,
p144
aVdiscrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;
p145
aVall these have come under pressure
p146
aVbecause of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
p147
aa(lp148
VI was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.
p149
aVI was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday
p150
aVand for the creation of new resources for his foundation.
p151
aVI was sitting next to Nelson Mandela \u2014 I was very privileged to do so \u2014
p152
aVwhen Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)
p153
aVAnd Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer
p154
aVand I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
p155
aVAmy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.
p156
aVMy husband too has spent a long time in prison."
p157
aV(Laughter)
p158
aVNelson Mandela then went down to the stage
p159
aVand he summarized the challenge for us all.
p160
aVHe said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain
p161
aVof challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
p162
aVHe said that there was a greater challenge ahead,
p163
aVthe challenge of poverty, of climate change \u2014 global challenges
p164
aVthat needed global solutions
p165
aVand needed the creation of a truly global society.
p166
aa(lp167
VWe are the first generation which is in a position to do this.
p168
aVCombine the power of a global ethic
p169
aVwith the power of our ability to communicate
p170
aVand organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,
p171
aVmost of which are global in their nature.
p172
aVClimate change cannot be solved in one country,
p173
aVbut has got to be solved by the world working together.
p174
aVA financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved
p175
aVby America alone or Europe alone;
p176
aVit needed the world to work together.
p177
aVTake the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,
p178
aVthe problem of human rights and development:
p179
aVthey cannot be solved by Africa alone;
p180
aVthey cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.
p181
aVWe cannot solve these problems unless we work together.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo the great project of our generation, it seems to me,
p184
aVis to build for the first time, out of a global ethic
p185
aVand our global ability to communicate
p186
aVand organize together, a truly global society,
p187
aVbuilt on that ethic but with institutions
p188
aVthat can serve that global society and make for a different future.
p189
aVWe have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.
p190
aVTake climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous
p191
aVthat we have a situation
p192
aVwhere we know that there is a climate change problem,
p193
aVwhere we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources
p194
aVto the poorest countries to deal with that,
p195
aVwhen we want to create a global carbon market,
p196
aVbut there is no global institution
p197
aVthat people have been able to agree upon
p198
aVto deal with this problem?
p199
aVOne of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months
p200
aVis an agreement that there will be
p201
aVa global environmental institution
p202
aVthat is able to deal
p203
aVwith the problems of persuading the whole of the world
p204
aVto move along a climate-change agenda.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VOne of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough
p209
aVis that we have got to persuade people around the world
p210
aVto change their behavior as well,
p211
aVso you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility
p212
aVacross the generations.
p213
aVTake the financial crisis.
p214
aVIf people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York
p215
aVor starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
p216
aVIf people can find that that sub-prime product
p217
aVhas been transferred across nations
p218
aVmany, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland
p219
aVor the rest in Britain,
p220
aVand people's ordinary savings are affected by it,
p221
aVthen you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
p222
aVYou need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,
p223
aVfor jobs, as well as for financial stability,
p224
aVglobal economic institutions that make sure
p225
aVthat growth to be sustained has to be shared,
p226
aVand are built on the principle
p227
aVthat the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions
p230
aVthat reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,
p231
aVnot the ideas that were the basis
p232
aVof the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
p233
aVThen take development and take the partnership we need between our countries
p234
aVand the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.
p235
aVWe do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,
p236
aVand yet, out of people\u2019s desire for a global ethic
p237
aVand a global society that can be done.
p238
aa(lp239
VI have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.
p240
aVThis is a country of six and a half million people,
p241
aVbut it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;
p242
aVit has 120 midwives.
p243
aVYou cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people
p244
aVwith such limited resources.
p245
aa(lp246
VOr take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,
p247
aVa girl called Miriam.
p248
aVShe was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,
p249
aVher mother and then her father.
p250
aVShe was an AIDS orphan being handed
p251
aVacross different extended families to be cared for.
p252
aVShe herself was suffering from HIV;
p253
aVshe was suffering from tuberculosis.
p254
aVI met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.
p255
aVWhen you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven
p256
aVis looking forward to the future,
p257
aVbut there was an unreachable sadness in that girl\u2019s eyes
p258
aVand if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,
p259
aVI believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund
p260
aVwould be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
p261
aa(lp262
VWe must then build a proper relationship between the richest and
p263
aVthe poorest countries
p264
aVbased on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves
p265
aVwith the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,
p266
aVso that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.
p267
aa(lp268
VTake the problems of human rights and
p269
aVthe problems of security in so many countries around the world.
p270
aVBurma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,
p271
aVin Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily
p272
aVfor wars that we could prevent.
p273
aVIn the Rwanda Children's Museum,
p274
aVthere is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy
p275
aVand the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost
p276
aVin the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
p277
aa(lp278
VThere is a photograph of a boy called David.
p279
aVBeside that photograph there is the information about his life.
p280
aVIt said "David, age 10."
p281
aVDavid: ambition to be a doctor.
p282
aVFavorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?
p283
aVMaking people laugh.
p284
aVHow did he die?
p285
aVTortured to death.
p286
aVLast words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:
p287
aV"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."
p288
aVAnd we never did.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd that young boy believed our promises
p291
aVthat we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,
p292
aVand we never did.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo we have got to create in this world also
p295
aVinstitutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,
p296
aVbut also for reconstruction and security
p297
aVfor some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
p298
aVSo my argument today is basically this.
p299
aVWe have the means by which we could create a truly global society.
p300
aVThe institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.
p301
aVThat global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary
p302
aVfor these institutions to work,
p303
aVbut we should not lose the chance in this generation,
p304
aVin this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,
p305
aVwith other people working with us around the world,
p306
aVto create global institutions for the environment,
p307
aVand for finance,
p308
aVand for security and for development,
p309
aVthat make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,
p310
aVour desire to bind the world together, and
p311
aVour need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
p312
aa(lp313
VIt is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,
p314
aVpeople used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."
p315
aVBut it is said that in Ancient Greece
p316
aVwhen Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,
p317
aVpeople turned to each other and didn\u2019t say "Great speech."
p318
aVThey said, "Let's march."
p319
aVWe should be marching towards a global society.
p320
aVThank you.
