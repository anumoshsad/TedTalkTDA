VThere's so many of you.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VWhen I was a kid,
p8
aVI hid my heart under the bed, because my mother said,
p9
aV"If you're not careful, someday someone's going to break it."
p10
aVTake it from me: Under the bed is not a good hiding spot.
p11
aVI know because I've been shot down so many times,
p12
aVI get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself.
p13
aVBut that's what we were told.
p14
aV"Stand up for yourself."
p15
aVAnd that's hard to do if you don't know who you are.
p16
aVWe were expected to define ourselves at such an early age,
p17
aVand if we didn't do it, others did it for us.
p18
aVGeek. Fatty.
p19
aVSlut. Fag.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd at the same time we were being told what we were,
p22
aVwe were being asked,
p23
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p24
aVI always thought that was an unfair question.
p25
aVIt presupposes that we can't be what we already are.
p26
aVWe were kids.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhen I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.
p29
aVI wanted a registered retirement savings plan
p30
aVthat would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VWhen I was a kid, I wanted to shave.
p35
aVNow, not so much.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VWhen I was eight, I wanted to be a marine biologist.
p40
aVWhen I was nine, I saw the movie "Jaws,"
p41
aVand thought to myself, "No, thank you."
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd when I was 10,
p46
aVI was told that my parents left because they didn't want me.
p47
aVWhen I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.
p48
aVWhen I was 12, I wanted to die. When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.
p49
aVWhen I was 14, I was asked to seriously consider a career path.
p50
aa(lp51
VI said, "I'd like to be a writer."
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd they said, "Choose something realistic."
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I said, "Professional wrestler."
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd they said, "Don't be stupid."
p58
aa(lp59
VSee, they asked me what I wanted to be,
p60
aVthen told me what not to be.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd I wasn't the only one.
p63
aVWe were being told that we somehow must become
p64
aVwhat we are not, sacrificing what we are
p65
aVto inherit the masquerade of what we will be.
p66
aVI was being told to accept the identity that others will give me.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I wondered, what made my dreams so easy to dismiss?
p69
aVGranted, my dreams are shy,
p70
aVbecause they're Canadian.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VMy dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic.
p75
aVThey're standing alone at the high school dance,
p76
aVand they've never been kissed.
p77
aVSee, my dreams got called names too.
p78
aVSilly. Foolish.
p79
aVImpossible.
p80
aVBut I kept dreaming.
p81
aVI was going to be a wrestler. I had it all figured out.
p82
aVI was going to be The Garbage Man.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VMy finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor.
p87
aVMy saying was going to be, "I'm taking out the trash!"
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd then this guy, Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,
p94
aVstole my entire shtick.
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VI was crushed,
p99
aVas if by a trash compactor.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VI thought to myself, "What now? Where do I turn?"
p104
aa(lp105
VPoetry.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VLike a boomerang, the thing I loved came back to me.
p110
aVOne of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing
p111
aVwas in response to a world that demanded I hate myself.
p112
aVFrom age 15 to 18, I hated myself
p113
aVfor becoming the thing that I loathed:
p114
aVa bully.
p115
aa(lp116
VWhen I was 19, I wrote,
p117
aV"I will love myself despite the ease with which
p118
aVI lean toward the opposite."
p119
aa(lp120
VStanding up for yourself doesn't have to mean
p121
aVembracing violence.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhen I was a kid,
p124
aVI traded in homework assignments for friendship,
p125
aVthen gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time,
p126
aVand in most cases, not at all.
p127
aVI gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise.
p128
aVAnd I remember this plan, born out of frustration
p129
aVfrom a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"
p130
aVthen pointed at my tummy and said, "Too many picnic baskets."
p131
aVTurns out it's not that hard to trick someone,
p132
aVand one day before class, I said,
p133
aV"Yeah, you can copy my homework,"
p134
aVand I gave him all the wrong answers that I'd written down the night before.
p135
aVHe got his paper back expecting a near-perfect score,
p136
aVand couldn't believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero.
p137
aVI knew I didn't have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30,
p138
aVbut my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me, puzzled,
p139
aVand I thought to myself, "Smarter than the average bear, motherfucker."
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VThis is who I am.
p146
aVThis is how I stand up for myself.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhen I was a kid,
p149
aVI used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing.
p150
aVI thought they were both pork chops.
p151
aVMy grandmother thought it was cute,
p152
aVand because they were my favorite, she let me keep doing it.
p153
aVNot really a big deal.
p154
aVOne day, before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees,
p155
aVI fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body.
p156
aVI didn't want to tell my grandmother
p157
aVbecause I was scared I'd get in trouble
p158
aVfor playing somewhere I shouldn't have been.
p159
aVThe gym teacher noticed the bruise, and I got sent to the principal's office.
p160
aVFrom there, I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady
p161
aVwho asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home.
p162
aVI saw no reason to lie.
p163
aVAs far as I was concerned, life was pretty good.
p164
aVI told her, whenever I'm sad, my grandmother gives me karate chops.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThis led to a full-scale investigation,
p169
aVand I was removed from the house for three days,
p170
aVuntil they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises.
p171
aVNews of this silly little story quickly spread through the school,
p172
aVand I earned my first nickname:
p173
aVPorkchop.
p174
aVTo this day,
p175
aVI hate pork chops.
p176
aa(lp177
VI'm not the only kid who grew up this way,
p178
aVsurrounded by people who used to say that rhyme
p179
aVabout sticks and stones,
p180
aVas if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called,
p181
aVand we got called them all.
p182
aVSo we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us,
p183
aVthat we'd be lonely forever,
p184
aVthat we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun
p185
aVwas something they built for us in their toolshed.
p186
aVSo broken heartstrings bled the blues,
p187
aVand we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.
p188
aVDon't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone,
p189
aVthat an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away,
p190
aVthat there's no way for it to metastasize; it does.
p191
aa(lp192
VShe was eight years old,
p193
aVour first day of grade three when she got called ugly.
p194
aVWe both got moved to the back of class
p195
aVso we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs.
p196
aVBut the school halls were a battleground.
p197
aVWe found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day.
p198
aVWe used to stay inside for recess, because outside was worse.
p199
aVOutside, we'd have to rehearse running away,
p200
aVor learn to stay still like statues, giving no clues that we were there.
p201
aVIn grade five, they taped a sign to the front of her desk
p202
aVthat read, "Beware of dog."
p203
aa(lp204
VTo this day,
p205
aVdespite a loving husband, she doesn't think she's beautiful,
p206
aVbecause of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face.
p207
aVKids used to say, "She looks like a wrong answer
p208
aVthat someone tried to erase, but couldn't quite get the job done."
p209
aVAnd they'll never understand that she's raising two kids
p210
aVwhose definition of beauty begins with the word "Mom,"
p211
aVbecause they see her heart before they see her skin,
p212
aVbecause she's only ever always been amazing.
p213
aa(lp214
VHe was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree,
p215
aVadopted,
p216
aVnot because his parents opted for a different destiny.
p217
aVHe was three when he became a mixed drink
p218
aVof one part left alone and two parts tragedy,
p219
aVstarted therapy in eighth grade,
p220
aVhad a personality made up of tests and pills,
p221
aVlived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs,
p222
aVfour-fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of antidepressants,
p223
aVand an adolescent being called "Popper,"
p224
aVone part because of the pills,
p225
aV99 parts because of the cruelty.
p226
aVHe tried to kill himself in grade 10
p227
aVwhen a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad
p228
aVhad the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."
p229
aVAs if depression is something that could be remedied
p230
aVby any of the contents found in a first-aid kit.
p231
aa(lp232
VTo this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends,
p233
aVcould describe to you in detail the way the sky bends
p234
aVin the moment before it's about to fall,
p235
aVand despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration,
p236
aVhe remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand
p237
aVsometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction
p238
aVand more to do with sanity.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe weren't the only kids who grew up this way.
p241
aVTo this day, kids are still being called names.
p242
aVThe classics were "Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."
p243
aVSeems like every school has an arsenal of names
p244
aVgetting updated every year.
p245
aVAnd if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear,
p246
aVdo they make a sound?
p247
aVAre they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,
p248
aVwhen people say things like, "Kids can be cruel."
p249
aVEvery school was a big top circus tent,
p250
aVand the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers,
p251
aVfrom clowns to carnies, all of these miles ahead of who we were.
p252
aVWe were freaks \u2014
p253
aVlobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,
p254
aVoddities juggling depression and loneliness,
p255
aVplaying solitaire, spin the bottle,
p256
aVtrying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal,
p257
aVbut at night, while the others slept,
p258
aVwe kept walking the tightrope.
p259
aVIt was practice, and yes, some of us fell.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut I want to tell them that all of this
p262
aVis just debris
p263
aVleft over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be,
p264
aVand if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself,
p265
aVget a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer,
p266
aVbecause there's something inside you that made you keep trying
p267
aVdespite everyone who told you to quit.
p268
aVYou built a cast around your broken heart
p269
aVand signed it yourself, "They were wrong."
p270
aVBecause maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique.
p271
aVMaybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything.
p272
aVMaybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,
p273
aVbecause how can you hold your ground
p274
aVif everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it?
p275
aVYou have to believe that they were wrong.
p276
aVThey have to be wrong.
p277
aVWhy else would we still be here?
p278
aa(lp279
VWe grew up learning to cheer on the underdog
p280
aVbecause we see ourselves in them.
p281
aVWe stem from a root planted in the belief
p282
aVthat we are not what we were called.
p283
aVWe are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway,
p284
aVand if in some way we are, don't worry.
p285
aVWe only got out to walk and get gas.
p286
aVWe are graduating members from the class of We Made It,
p287
aVnot the faded echoes of voices crying out,
p288
aV"Names will never hurt me."
p289
aVOf course they did.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act
p292
aVthat has less to do with pain
p293
aVand more to do with beauty.
