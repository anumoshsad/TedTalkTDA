VWhat I thought I would talk about today
p4
aVis the transition from one mode
p5
aVof thinking about nature
p6
aVto another that's tracked by architecture.
p7
aVWhat's interesting about architects is,
p8
aVwe always have tried to justify beauty
p9
aVby looking to nature,
p10
aVand arguably, beautiful architecture
p11
aVhas always been looking at a model of nature.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo, for roughly 300 years,
p14
aVthe hot debate in architecture
p15
aVwas whether the number five
p16
aVor the number seven
p17
aVwas a better proportion to think about architecture,
p18
aVbecause the nose was one-fifth of your head,
p19
aVor because your head was one-seventh of your body.
p20
aVAnd the reason that that was the model
p21
aVof beauty and of nature
p22
aVwas because the decimal point had not been invented yet \u2014
p23
aVit wasn't the 16th century \u2014
p24
aVand everybody had to dimension a building
p25
aVin terms of fractions,
p26
aVso a room would be dimensioned
p27
aVas one-fourth of a facade;
p28
aVthe structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,
p29
aVand you would get down to the small elements
p30
aVby fractional subdivision:
p31
aVfiner and finer and finer.
p32
aa(lp33
VIn the 15th century, the decimal point was invented;
p34
aVarchitects stopped using fractions,
p35
aVand they had a new model of nature.
p36
aVSo, what's going on today
p37
aVis that there's a model of natural form
p38
aVwhich is calculus-based
p39
aVand which is using digital tools,
p40
aVand that has a lot of implications
p41
aVto the way we think about beauty and form,
p42
aVand it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature.
p43
aVThe best example of this would probably be the Gothic,
p44
aVand the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus,
p45
aValthough the Gothic architects
p46
aVweren't really using calculus to define their forms.
p47
aVBut what was important is,
p48
aVthe Gothic moment in architecture was the first time
p49
aVthat force and motion was thought of in terms of form.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross:
p52
aVyou can see that the structural forces of the vaulting
p53
aVget articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing
p54
aVthe expression of structural force and form.
p55
aVMuch later, Robert Maillart's bridges,
p56
aVwhich optimize structural form
p57
aVwith a calculus curvature almost like a parabola.
p58
aVThe Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi,
p59
aVthe Catalan architect.
p60
aVThe end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century,
p61
aVand how that Hanging Chain model
p62
aVtranslates into archways
p63
aVand vaulting.
p64
aVSo, in all of these examples,
p65
aVstructure is the determining force.
p66
aVFrei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
p67
aVand foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.
p68
aVInterestingly, in the last 10 years
p69
aVNorman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model
p70
aVto generate the roof of the National Gallery,
p71
aVwith the structural engineer Chris Williams.
p72
aa(lp73
VIn all these examples,
p74
aVthere's one ideal form,
p75
aVbecause these are thought in terms of structure.
p76
aVAnd as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems
p77
aVvery limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms
p78
aVand I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, what I thought I would bring up is
p81
aVanother component that needs to be thought of,
p82
aVwhenever you think about nature,
p83
aVand that's basically the invention of
p84
aVgeneric form in genetic evolution.
p85
aVMy hero is actually not Darwin;
p86
aVit's a guy named William Bateson,
p87
aVfather of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
p88
aVAnd he was what you'd call a teratologist:
p89
aVhe looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations
p90
aVto find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.
p91
aVSo, instead of trying to find the ideal type
p92
aVor the ideal average,
p93
aVhe'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,
p94
aVwhich is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule,
p95
aVhe has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.
p96
aVWhen I first saw this image, 10 years ago,
p97
aVI actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
p98
aVBeautiful, because it has symmetry.
p99
aVSo, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations,
p100
aVinstead of having a thumb,
p101
aVyou would either get another opposable thumb,
p102
aVor you would get four fingers.
p103
aVSo, the mutations reverted to symmetry.
p104
aVAnd Bateson invented
p105
aVthe concept of symmetry breaking,
p106
aVwhich is that
p107
aVwherever you lose information in a system,
p108
aVyou revert back to symmetry.
p109
aVSo, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization \u2014
p110
aVwhich is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect \u2014
p111
aVsymmetry was the absence of information.
p112
aVSo, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry;
p113
aVwhenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.
p114
aVSo, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment
p115
aVfrom looking for ideal shapes
p116
aVto looking for a combination of
p117
aVinformation and generic form.
p118
aa(lp119
VYou know, literally after seeing that image,
p120
aVand finding out what Bateson was working with,
p121
aVwe started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching
p122
aVto start to think about architectural form.
p123
aVTo just talk for a minute about the
p124
aVdigital mediums that we're using now
p125
aVand how they integrate calculus:
p126
aVthe fact that they're calculus-based
p127
aVmeans that we don't have to think about dimension
p128
aVin terms of ideal units
p129
aVor discreet elements.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo, in architecture we deal with
p132
aVbig assemblies of components,
p133
aVso there might be up to, say,
p134
aV50,000 pieces of material
p135
aVin this room you're sitting in right now
p136
aVthat all need to get organized.
p137
aVNow, typically you'd think that they would all be the same:
p138
aVlike, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.
p139
aVYou know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm
p140
aVthat every chair would be a slightly different dimension,
p141
aVbecause you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines.
p142
aVThe elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting,
p143
aVthey're all losing their modular quality,
p144
aVand moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
p145
aVThat's because we're all using calculus tools
p146
aVfor manufacturing and for design.
p147
aa(lp148
VCalculus is also a mathematics of curves.
p149
aVSo, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve.
p150
aVIt's just a curve without inflection.
p151
aVSo, a new vocabulary of form
p152
aVis now pervading all design fields:
p153
aVwhether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,
p154
aVit's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature.
p155
aVThe intricacies of scale that come out of that \u2014
p156
aVyou know, in the example of the nose to the face,
p157
aVthere's a fractional part-to-whole idea.
p158
aVWith calculus, the whole idea
p159
aVof subdivision is more complex,
p160
aVbecause the whole and the parts are one continuous series.
p161
aVIt's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus,
p162
aVso I brought some images to just describe how that works.
p163
aa(lp164
VThis is a Korean church that we did in Queens.
p165
aVAnd in this example, you can see
p166
aVthat the components of this stair are repetitive,
p167
aVbut they're repetitive without being modular.
p168
aVEach one of the elements in this structure
p169
aVis a unique distance and dimension,
p170
aVand all of the connections are unique angles.
p171
aVNow, the only way we could design that,
p172
aVor possibly construct it,
p173
aVis by using a calculus-based definition
p174
aVof the form.
p175
aVIt also is much more dynamic,
p176
aVso that you can see that the same form opens and closes
p177
aVin a very dynamic way as you move across it,
p178
aVbecause it has this quality of vector in motion
p179
aVbuilt into it.
p180
aVSo the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume,
p181
aVwhen seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.
p182
aVAnd you also get a sense of
p183
aVvisual movement in the space,
p184
aVbecause every one of the elements is changing in a pattern,
p185
aVso that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.
p186
aVI think that's one of the main changes,
p187
aValso, in architecture:
p188
aVthat we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,
p189
aVlike a Latin cross for a church,
p190
aVbut actually all the traits of a church:
p191
aVso, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,
p192
aVdirectionality that focuses you towards an altar.
p193
aVIt turns out it's not rocket science
p194
aVto design a sacred space.
p195
aVYou just need to incorporate a certain number of traits
p196
aVin a very kind of genetic way.
p197
aVSo, these are the different perspectives of that interior,
p198
aVwhich has a very complex
p199
aVset of orientations all in a simple form.
p200
aa(lp201
VIn terms of construction and manufacturing,
p202
aVthis is a kilometer-long housing block
p203
aVthat was built in the '70s in Amsterdam.
p204
aVAnd here we've broken the 500 apartments
p205
aVup into small neighborhoods,
p206
aVand differentiated those neighborhoods.
p207
aVI won't go into too much description of any of these projects,
p208
aVbut what you can see is that
p209
aVthe escalators and elevators
p210
aVthat circulate people along the face of the building
p211
aVare all held up by
p212
aV122 structural trusses.
p213
aVBecause we're using escalators
p214
aVto move people,
p215
aVall of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.
p216
aVSo, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped
p217
aVas you move down the length of the building.
p218
aVSo, working with
p219
aVBentley and MicroStation,
p220
aVwe've written a custom piece of software
p221
aVthat networks all of the components together
p222
aVinto these chunks of information,
p223
aVso that if we change any element
p224
aValong the length of the building,
p225
aVnot only does that change distribute
p226
aVthrough each one of the trusses,
p227
aVbut each one of the trusses then distributes that information
p228
aVdown the length of the entire facade of the building.
p229
aVSo it's a single calculation
p230
aVfor every single component of the building
p231
aVthat we're adding onto.
p232
aVSo, it's tens of millions of calculations
p233
aVjust to design one connection between a piece of structural steel
p234
aVand another piece of structural steel.
p235
aVBut what it gives us is a harmonic
p236
aVand synthesized
p237
aVrelationship of all these components, one to another.
p238
aa(lp239
VThis idea has, kind of, brought me into doing
p240
aVsome product design,
p241
aVand it's because design firms
p242
aVthat have connections to architects,
p243
aVlike, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company,
p244
aVand Alessi, which is a houseware company.
p245
aVThey saw this actually solving a problem:
p246
aVthis ability to differentiate components
p247
aVbut keep them synthetic.
p248
aVSo, not to pick on BMW,
p249
aVor to celebrate them,
p250
aVbut take BMW as an example.
p251
aVThey have to, in 2005,
p252
aVhave a distinct identity
p253
aVfor all their models of cars.
p254
aVSo, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is,
p255
aVthe 100 series that's coming out,
p256
aVhas to look like the 700 series,
p257
aVat the other end of their product line,
p258
aVso they need a distinct, coherent identity,
p259
aVwhich is BMW.
p260
aVAt the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars
p261
aVfor a 300-series car,
p262
aVand a person paying 70,000 dollars
p263
aVfor a 700 series,
p264
aVand that person paying more than double
p265
aVdoesn't want their car to look too much like
p266
aVthe bottom-of-the-market car.
p267
aVSo they have to also discriminate between these products.
p268
aVSo, as manufacturing
p269
aVstarts to allow more
p270
aVdesign options,
p271
aVthis problem gets exacerbated,
p272
aVof the whole and the parts.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships
p275
aVis all I think about,
p276
aVbut in terms of product design
p277
aVit's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.
p278
aVSo, the first kind of test product we did
p279
aVwas with Alessi,
p280
aVwhich was for a coffee and tea set.
p281
aVIt's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set;
p282
aVwe knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew
p283
aVdown south in San Diego,
p284
aVand we used an exploded
p285
aVtitanium forming method
p286
aVthat's used in the aerospace industry.
p287
aVBasically what we can do,
p288
aVis just cut a graphite mold,
p289
aVput it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees,
p290
aVgently inflate titanium that's soft,
p291
aVand then explode it at the last minute into this form.
p292
aVBut what's great about it is,
p293
aVthe forms are only a few hundred dollars.
p294
aVThe titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.
p295
aVSo, we designed a system here
p296
aVof eight curves that could be swapped,
p297
aVvery similar to that housing project I showed you,
p298
aVand we could recombine those together,
p299
aVso that we always had ergonomic shapes
p300
aVthat always had the same volume
p301
aVand could always be produced in the same way.
p302
aVThat way, each one of these tools we could pay for with
p303
aVa few hundred dollars,
p304
aVand get incredible variation in the components.
p305
aVAnd this is one of those examples of the sets.
p306
aVSo, for me, what was important is that
p307
aVthis coffee set \u2014
p308
aVwhich is just a coffee pot, a teapot,
p309
aVand those are the pots sitting on a tray \u2014
p310
aVthat they would have a coherence \u2014
p311
aVso, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots \u2014
p312
aVbut that everyone who bought one
p313
aVwould have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.
p314
aa(lp315
VTo go back to architecture,
p316
aVwhat's organic about architecture as a field,
p317
aVunlike product design,
p318
aVis this whole issue of holism
p319
aVand of monumentality is really our realm.
p320
aVLike, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,
p321
aVbut also break down into small rooms
p322
aVand have an identity of both the big scale
p323
aVand the small scale.
p324
aVArchitects tend to work with signature,
p325
aVso that an architect needs a signature
p326
aVand that signature has to work across the scale of houses
p327
aVup to, say, skyscrapers,
p328
aVand that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining
p329
aVand working with; and intricacy,
p330
aVwhich is the relationship of, say,
p331
aVthe shape of a building, its structure, its windows,
p332
aVits color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, my kind of hero for this in the natural world
p335
aVare these tropical frogs.
p336
aVI got interested in them because they're the most
p337
aVextreme example
p338
aVof a surface where
p339
aVthe texture and the \u2014 let's call it the decoration \u2014
p340
aVI know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works \u2014
p341
aVare all intricately connected to one another.
p342
aVSo a change in the form
p343
aVindicates a change in the color pattern.
p344
aVSo, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,
p345
aVbut they really work together and are fused
p346
aVin some way.
p347
aVSo, when doing a center
p348
aVfor the national parks in Costa Rica,
p349
aVwe tried to use that idea of a gradient color
p350
aVand a change in texture
p351
aVas the structure moves across the surface of the building.
p352
aVWe also used a continuity of change
p353
aVfrom a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum,
p354
aVso it's all one continuous change
p355
aVin the massing,
p356
aVbut within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.
p357
aa(lp358
VIn a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,
p359
aVthe different towers of housing fused together
p360
aVin shared curves so you get a single mass,
p361
aVlike a kind of monolith,
p362
aVbut it breaks down into individual elements.
p363
aVAnd you can see that that change in massing
p364
aValso gives all 48 of the apartments
p365
aVa unique shape and size,
p366
aVbut always within a, kind of, controlled limit,
p367
aVan envelope of change.
p368
aa(lp369
VI work with a group of other architects.
p370
aVWe have a company called United Architects.
p371
aVWe were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
p372
aVAnd I think this just shows how
p373
aVwe were approaching
p374
aVthe problem of incredibly large-scale construction.
p375
aVWe wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral
p376
aVaround the footprints of the World Trade Center site.
p377
aVAnd to do that, we tried to connect up
p378
aVthe five towers into a single system.
p379
aVAnd we looked at, from the 1950s on,
p380
aVthere were numerous examples of other architects
p381
aVtrying to do the same thing.
p382
aVWe really approached it at the level
p383
aVof the typology of the building,
p384
aVwhere we could build these five separate towers,
p385
aVbut they would all join at the 60th floor
p386
aVand make a kind of single monolithic mass.
p387
aVWith United Architects, also,
p388
aVwe made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters
p389
aVthat used the same system,
p390
aVbut this time in a much more monolithic mass,
p391
aVlike a sphere.
p392
aVBut again, you can see this, kind of,
p393
aVorganic fusion
p394
aVof multiple building elements
p395
aVto make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts,
p396
aVbut in an incredibly organic way.
p397
aa(lp398
VFinally, I'd like to just show you
p399
aVsome of the effects of using digital fabrication.
p400
aVAbout six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills,
p401
aVto just replace, kind of,
p402
aVyoung people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.
p403
aVAnd I also bought a laser cutter
p404
aVand started to fabricate within my own shop,
p405
aVkind of, large-scale building elements and models,
p406
aVwhere we could go directly to the tooling.
p407
aVWhat I found out is that the tooling,
p408
aVif you intervened in the software,
p409
aVactually produced decorative effects.
p410
aVSo, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden,
p411
aVor this installation wall in the Netherlands
p412
aVat the Netherlands Architecture Institute,
p413
aVwe could use the texture that the tool would leave
p414
aVto produce a lot of the spatial effects,
p415
aVand we could integrate the texture of the wall
p416
aVwith the form of the wall with the material.
p417
aVSo, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass,
p418
aVand then even at the level of structural steel,
p419
aVwhich you think of as being linear and modular.
p420
aVThe steel industry is so far
p421
aVahead of the design industry
p422
aVthat if you take advantage of it
p423
aVyou can even start to think of beams and columns
p424
aVall rolled together into a single system
p425
aVwhich is highly efficient,
p426
aVbut also produces decorative effects
p427
aVand formal effects
p428
aVthat are very beautiful and organic.
p429
aVThanks very much.
