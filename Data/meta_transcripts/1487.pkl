VEveryone is both a learner
p4
aVand a teacher.
p5
aVThis is me being inspired
p6
aVby my first tutor,
p7
aVmy mom,
p8
aVand this is me teaching
p9
aVIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence
p10
aVto 200 students
p11
aVat Stanford University.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow the students and I
p14
aVenjoyed the class,
p15
aVbut it occurred to me
p16
aVthat while the subject matter
p17
aVof the class is advanced
p18
aVand modern,
p19
aVthe teaching technology isn't.
p20
aVIn fact, I use basically
p21
aVthe same technology as
p22
aVthis 14th-century classroom.
p23
aVNote the textbook,
p24
aVthe sage on the stage,
p25
aVand the sleeping guy
p26
aVin the back. (Laughter)
p27
aVJust like today.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo my co-teacher,
p30
aVSebastian Thrun, and I thought,
p31
aVthere must be a better way.
p32
aVWe challenged ourselves
p33
aVto create an online class
p34
aVthat would be equal or better
p35
aVin quality to our Stanford class,
p36
aVbut to bring it to anyone
p37
aVin the world for free.
p38
aa(lp39
VWe announced the class on July 29th,
p40
aVand within two weeks, 50,000 people
p41
aVhad signed up for it.
p42
aVAnd that grew to 160,000 students
p43
aVfrom 209 countries.
p44
aVWe were thrilled to have
p45
aVthat kind of audience,
p46
aVand just a bit terrified that we
p47
aVhadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo we got to work.
p50
aVWe studied what others had done,
p51
aVwhat we could copy and what we could change.
p52
aVBenjamin Bloom had showed
p53
aVthat one-on-one tutoring works best,
p54
aVso that's what we tried to emulate,
p55
aVlike with me and my mom,
p56
aVeven though we knew
p57
aVit would be one-on-thousands.
p58
aVHere, an overhead video camera
p59
aVis recording me as I'm talking
p60
aVand drawing on a piece of paper.
p61
aa(lp62
VA student said, "This class felt
p63
aVlike sitting in a bar
p64
aVwith a really smart friend
p65
aVwho's explaining something
p66
aVyou haven't grasped, but are about to."
p67
aVAnd that's exactly what we were aiming for.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, from Khan Academy, we saw
p70
aVthat short 10-minute videos
p71
aVworked much better than trying
p72
aVto record an hour-long lecture
p73
aVand put it on the small-format screen.
p74
aVWe decided to go even shorter
p75
aVand more interactive.
p76
aVOur typical video is two minutes,
p77
aVsometimes shorter, never more
p78
aVthan six, and then we pause for
p79
aVa quiz question, to make it
p80
aVfeel like one-on-one tutoring.
p81
aVHere, I'm explaining how a computer uses
p82
aVthe grammar of English
p83
aVto parse sentences, and here,
p84
aVthere's a pause and the student
p85
aVhas to reflect, understand what's going on
p86
aVand check the right boxes
p87
aVbefore they can continue.
p88
aa(lp89
VStudents learn best when
p90
aVthey're actively practicing.
p91
aVWe wanted to engage them, to have them grapple
p92
aVwith ambiguity and guide them to synthesize
p93
aVthe key ideas themselves.
p94
aVWe mostly avoid questions
p95
aVlike, "Here's a formula, now
p96
aVtell me the value of Y
p97
aVwhen X is equal to two."
p98
aVWe preferred open-ended questions.
p99
aa(lp100
VOne student wrote, "Now I'm seeing
p101
aVBayes networks and examples of
p102
aVgame theory everywhere I look."
p103
aVAnd I like that kind of response.
p104
aVThat's just what we were going for.
p105
aVWe didn't want students to memorize the formulas;
p106
aVwe wanted to change the way
p107
aVthey looked at the world.
p108
aVAnd we succeeded.
p109
aVOr, I should say, the students succeeded.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd it's a little bit ironic
p112
aVthat we set about to disrupt traditional education,
p113
aVand in doing so, we ended up
p114
aVmaking our online class
p115
aVmuch more like a traditional college class
p116
aVthan other online classes.
p117
aVMost online classes, the videos are always available.
p118
aVYou can watch them any time you want.
p119
aVBut if you can do it any time,
p120
aVthat means you can do it tomorrow,
p121
aVand if you can do it tomorrow,
p122
aVwell, you may not ever
p123
aVget around to it. (Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VSo we brought back the innovation
p126
aVof having due dates. (Laughter)
p127
aVYou could watch the videos
p128
aVany time you wanted during the week,
p129
aVbut at the end of the week,
p130
aVyou had to get the homework done.
p131
aVThis motivated the students to keep going, and it also
p132
aVmeant that everybody was working
p133
aVon the same thing at the same time,
p134
aVso if you went into a discussion forum,
p135
aVyou could get an answer from a peer within minutes.
p136
aVNow, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which
p137
aVwere self-organized by the students themselves.
p138
aa(lp139
VFrom Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned
p140
aVthe concept of "flipping" the classroom.
p141
aVStudents watched the videos
p142
aVon their own, and then they
p143
aVcome together to discuss them.
p144
aVFrom Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,
p145
aVthat peers can be the best teachers,
p146
aVbecause they're the ones
p147
aVthat remember what it's like to not understand.
p148
aVSebastian and I have forgotten some of that.
p149
aVOf course, we couldn't have
p150
aVa classroom discussion with
p151
aVtens of thousands of students,
p152
aVso we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd finally, from Teach For America,
p155
aVI learned that a class is not
p156
aVprimarily about information.
p157
aVMore important is motivation and determination.
p158
aVIt was crucial that the students see
p159
aVthat we're working hard for them and
p160
aVthey're all supporting each other.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow, the class ran 10 weeks,
p163
aVand in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched
p164
aVat least one video each week,
p165
aVand over 20,000 finished all the homework,
p166
aVputting in 50 to 100 hours.
p167
aVThey got this statement of accomplishment.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo what have we learned?
p170
aVWell, we tried some old ideas
p171
aVand some new and put them together,
p172
aVbut there are more ideas to try.
p173
aVSebastian's teaching another class now.
p174
aVI'll do one in the fall.
p175
aVStanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx
p176
aVand others have more classes coming.
p177
aVIt's a really exciting time.
p178
aa(lp179
VBut to me, the most exciting
p180
aVpart of it is the data that we're gathering.
p181
aVWe're gathering thousands
p182
aVof interactions per student per class,
p183
aVbillions of interactions altogether,
p184
aVand now we can start analyzing that,
p185
aVand when we learn from that,
p186
aVdo experimentations,
p187
aVthat's when the real revolution will come.
p188
aVAnd you'll be able to see the results from
p189
aVa new generation of amazing students.
