aa(lp6
V\u266aA Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects \u266a
p7
aa(lp8
V\u266a But her mind is awhirl \u266a
p9
aa(lp10
V\u266a When she finds the tomb empty \u266a
p11
aa(lp12
V\u266a Straw had been rolled \u266a
p13
aa(lp14
V\u266a Not a sign of a corpse \u266a
p15

V\u266a In the dark and the cold \u266a
p17

V\u266a When she reaches the door \u266a
p19

V\u266a Sees an unholy sight \u266a
p21
aa(lp22
V\u266a There's a solitary figure and a halo of light \u266a

V\u266a He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill \u266a
p25
aa(lp26
V\u266a In an Almighty hurry \u266a
p27
aa(lp28
V\u266a Aye, but she might catch him still \u266a
p29
aa(lp30
V\u266a Tell me where are you gone, Lord \u266a
p31
aa(lp32
V\u266a And why in such haste? \u266a
p33
aa(lp34
V\u266a Oh don't hinder me, woman \u266a
p35
aV\u266a I've no time to waste \u266a
p36
aa(lp37

p46

p48
aa(lp49
V\u266a Through the teeth of this tempest \u266a
p50

p52

V\u266a May the angels protect me \u266a
p54
aa(lp55
V\u266a If all else should fail \u266a
p56
aa(lp57
V\u266a And the last ship sails \u266a
p58
aa(lp59
V\u266a Oh the roar of the chains \u266a
p60
aa(lp61
V\u266a And the cracking of timbers \u266a
p62
aa(lp63
V\u266a The noise at the end of the world in your ears \u266a
p64
aa(lp65
V\u266a As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea \u266a
p66
aa(lp67
V\u266a And the last ship sails \u266a
p68
aa(lp69
VSo I was born and raised
p70
aVin the shadow of a shipyard
p71
aVin a little town on the northeast coast of England.
p72
aVSome of my earliest memories
p73
aVare of giant ships
p74
aVblocking the end of my street,
p75
aVas well as the sun, for a lot of the year.
p76
aVEvery morning as a child,
p77
aVI'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill
p78
aVto work in the shipyard.
p79
aVI'd watch those same men
p80
aVwalking back home every night.
p81
aVIt has to be said, the shipyard was not
p82
aVthe most pleasant place to live next door to,
p83
aVor indeed work in.
p84
aVThe shipyard was noisy, dangerous,
p85
aVhighly toxic,
p86
aVwith an appalling health and safety record.
p87
aa(lp88
VDespite that, the men and women
p89
aVwho worked on those ships
p90
aVwere extraordinarily proud of the work they did,
p91
aVand justifiably so.
p92
aVSome of the largest vessels
p93
aVever constructed on planet Earth
p94
aVwere built right at the end of my street.
p95
aa(lp96
VMy grandfather had been a shipwright,
p97
aVand as a child,
p98
aVas there were few other jobs in the town,
p99
aVI would wonder with some anxiety
p100
aVwhether that would be my destiny too.
p101
aVI was fairly determined that it wouldn't be.
p102
aVI had other dreams,
p103
aVnot necessarily practical ones,
p104
aVbut at the age of eight,
p105
aVI was bequeathed a guitar.
p106
aVIt was a battered old thing
p107
aVwith five rusty strings, and was out of tune,
p108
aVbut quickly I learned to play it
p109
aVand realized that I'd found a friend for life,
p110
aVan accomplice, a co-conspirator
p111
aVin my plan to escape from this surreal
p112
aVindustrial landscape.
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, they say if you dream something hard enough,
p115
aVit will come to pass.
p116
aVEither that, or I was extremely lucky,
p117
aVbut this was my dream.
p118
aVI dreamt I would leave this town,
p119
aVand just like those ships,
p120
aVonce they were launched, I'd never come back.
p121
aVI dreamt I'd become a writer of songs,
p122
aVthat I would sing those songs
p123
aVto vast numbers of people all over the world,
p124
aVthat I would be paid extravagant amounts of money,
p125
aVthat I'd become famous,
p126
aVthat I'd marry a beautiful woman,
p127
aVhave children, raise a family,
p128
aVbuy a big house in the country,
p129
aVkeep dogs, grow wine,
p130
aVhave rooms full of Grammy Awards,
p131
aVplatinum discs, and what have you.
p132
aVSo far, so good, right? (Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd then one day, the songs stopped coming,
p135
aVand while you've suffered from periods
p136
aVof writer's block before, albeit briefly,
p137
aVthis is something chronic.
p138
aVDay after day, you face a blank page,
p139
aVand nothing's coming.
p140
aVAnd those days turned to weeks, and weeks to months,
p141
aVand pretty soon those months
p142
aVhave turned into years
p143
aVwith very little to show for your efforts. No songs.
p144
aVSo you start asking yourself questions.
p145
aVWhat have I done to offend the gods
p146
aVthat they would abandon me so?
p147
aVIs the gift of songwriting taken away
p148
aVas easily as it seems to have been bestowed?
p149
aVOr perhaps there's a more \u2014
p150
aVa deeper psychological reason.
p151
aVIt was always a Faustian pact anyway.
p152
aVYou're rewarded for revealing
p153
aVyour innermost thoughts,
p154
aVyour private emotions on the page
p155
aVfor the entertainment of others,
p156
aVfor the analysis, the scrutiny of others,
p157
aVand perhaps you've given enough
p158
aVof your privacy away.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd yet, if you look at your work,
p161
aVcould it be argued that your best work
p162
aVwasn't about you at all,
p163
aVit was about somebody else?
p164
aVDid your best work occur
p165
aVwhen you sidestepped your own ego
p166
aVand you stopped telling your story,
p167
aVbut told someone else's story,
p168
aVsomeone perhaps without a voice,
p169
aVwhere empathetically, you stood in his shoes
p170
aVfor a while or saw the world through his eyes?
p171
aa(lp172
VWell they say, write what you know.
p173
aVIf you can't write about yourself anymore,
p174
aVthen who do you write about?
p175
aVSo it's ironic that the landscape
p176
aVI'd worked so hard to escape from,
p177
aVand the community that I'd more or less abandoned
p178
aVand exiled myself from
p179
aVshould be the very landscape,
p180
aVthe very community I would have to return to
p181
aVto find my missing muse.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd as soon as I did that,
p184
aVas soon as I decided to honor the community
p185
aVI came from and tell their story,
p186
aVthat the songs started to come thick and fast.
p187
aVI've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,
p188
aVa torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,
p189
aVof verses, couplets, entire songs
p190
aValmost formed whole,
p191
aVmaterialized in front of me
p192
aVas if they'd been bottled up inside me
p193
aVfor many, many years.
p194
aVOne of the first things I wrote was just a list of names
p195
aVof people I'd known,
p196
aVand they become characters
p197
aVin a kind of three-dimensional drama,
p198
aVwhere they explain who they are, what they do,
p199
aVtheir hopes and their fears for the future.
p200
aa(lp201
VThis is Jackie White.
p202
aVHe's the foreman of the shipyard.
p203
aa(lp204
VMy name is Jackie White,
p205
aVand I'm foreman of the yard,
p206
aVand you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
p207
aVI'm as hard as iron plate,
p208
aVwoe betide you if you're late
p209
aVwhen we have to push a boat out on the spring tide.
p210
aVNow you can die and hope for heaven,
p211
aVbut you need to work your shift,
p212
aVand I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt,
p213
aVfor if St. Peter at his gate
p214
aVwere to ask you why you're late,
p215
aVwhy, you tell him that you had to get a ship built.
p216
aVWe build battleships and cruisers
p217
aa(lp218
Vfor Her Majesty the Queen,
p219
aVsupertankers for Onassis, and all the classes in between,
p220
aVWe built the greatest ship in tonnage
p221
aVwhat the world has ever seen
p222
aa(lp223
V\u266a And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard \u266a
p224
aa(lp225
V\u266a Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul \u266a
p226
aa(lp227
V\u266a Would conjure up a ship \u266a
p228
aa(lp229
V\u266a Where there used to be a hull \u266a
p230
aa(lp231
V\u266a And we don't know what we'll do \u266a
p232
aa(lp233
V\u266a If this yard gets sold \u266a
p234
aa(lp235
V\u266a For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard \u266a
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VSo having decided to write about other people
p240
aVinstead of myself,
p241
aVa further irony is that sometimes you reveal
p242
aVmore about yourself than you'd ever intended.
p243
aVThis song is called "Dead Man's Boots,"
p244
aVwhich is an expression
p245
aVwhich describes how difficult it is to get a job;
p246
aVin other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard
p247
aVif somebody else died.
p248
aVOr perhaps your father could finagle you
p249
aVan apprenticeship at the age of 15.
p250
aVBut sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued
p251
aVas controlling,
p252
aVand conversely, the scope of his son's ambition
p253
aVcan seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy.
p254
aV(Music)
p255
aa(lp256
V\u266a You see these work boots in my hands \u266a
p257
aa(lp258
V\u266a They'll probably fit you now, my son \u266a
p259
aa(lp260
V\u266a Take them, they're a gift from me \u266a
p261
aa(lp262
V\u266a Why don't you try them on? \u266a
p263
aa(lp264
V\u266a It would do your old man good to see \u266a
p265
aa(lp266
V\u266a You walking in these boots one day \u266a
p267
aa(lp268
V\u266a And take your place among the men \u266a
p269
aa(lp270
V\u266a Who work upon the slipway \u266a
p271
aa(lp272
V\u266a These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled \u266a
p273
aa(lp274
V\u266a When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world \u266a
p275
aa(lp276
V\u266a And it's time for a man to put down roots \u266a
p277
aa(lp278
V\u266a And walk to the river in his old man's boots \u266a
p279
aa(lp280
V\u266a He said, "I'm dying, son, and asking \u266a
p281
aa(lp282
V\u266a That you do one final thing for me \u266a
p283
aa(lp284
V\u266a You're barely but a sapling, and you think that you're a tree \u266a
p285
aa(lp286
V\u266a If you need a seed to prosper \u266a
p287
aa(lp288
V\u266a You must first put down some roots \u266a
p289
aa(lp290
V\u266a Just one foot then the other in \u266a
p291
aa(lp292
V\u266a These dead man's boots" \u266a
p293
aa(lp294
V\u266a These dead man's boots, though they're old and curled \u266a
p295
aa(lp296
V\u266a When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world \u266a
p297
aa(lp298
V\u266a And it's time for a man to put down roots \u266a
p299
aa(lp300
V\u266a And walk to the river in his old man's boots \u266a
p301
aa(lp302
V\u266a I said, "Why in the hell would I do that? \u266a
p303
aa(lp304
V\u266a Why would I agree?" \u266a
p305
aa(lp306
V\u266a When his hand was all that I'd received \u266a
p307
aa(lp308
V\u266a As far as I remember \u266a
p309
aa(lp310
V\u266a It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness \u266a
p311
aa(lp312
V\u266a Up to then, you see \u266a
p313
aa(lp314
V\u266a I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place \u266a
p315
aa(lp316
V\u266a When I came of age September \u266a
p317
aa(lp318
V\u266a These dead man's boots know their way down the hill \u266a
p319
aa(lp320
V\u266a They could walk there themselves, and they probably will \u266a
p321
aa(lp322
V\u266a I've plenty of choices, I've plenty other routes \u266a
p323
aa(lp324
V\u266a And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots \u266a
p325
aa(lp326
V\u266a What was it made him think \u266a
p327
aa(lp328
V\u266a I'd be happy ending up like him \u266a
p329
aa(lp330
V\u266a When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left \u266a
p331
aa(lp332
V\u266a Or a broken pot to piss in? \u266a
p333
aa(lp334
V\u266a He wanted this same thing for me \u266a
p335
aa(lp336
V\u266a Was that his final wish? \u266a
p337
aa(lp338
V\u266a He said, "What the hell are you gonna do?" \u266a
p339
aa(lp340
V\u266a I said, "Anything but this!" \u266a
p341
aa(lp342
V\u266a These dead man's boots know their way down the hill \u266a
p343
aa(lp344
V\u266a They can walk there themselves and they probably will \u266a
p345
aa(lp346
V\u266a But they won't walk with me \u2018cause I'm off the other way \u266a
p347
aa(lp348
V\u266a I've had it up to here, I'm gonna have my say \u266a
p349
aa(lp350
V\u266a When all you've got left is that cross on the wall \u266a
p351
aa(lp352
V\u266a I want nothing from you, I want nothing at all \u266a
p353
aa(lp354
V\u266a Not a pension, nor a pittance, when your whole life is through \u266a
p355
aa(lp356
V\u266a Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you \u266a
p357
aa(lp358
V\u266a I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more disputes \u266a
p359
aa(lp360
V\u266a And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots \u266a
p361
aa(lp362
V(Applause)
p363
aa(lp364
VThank you.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo whenever they'd launch a big ship,
p367
aVthey would invite some dignitary up from London
p368
aVon the train to make a speech,
p369
aVbreak a bottle of champagne over the bows,
p370
aVlaunch it down the slipway
p371
aVinto the river and out to sea.
p372
aVOccasionally on a really important ship,
p373
aVthey'd get a member of the royal family to come,
p374
aVDuke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody.
p375
aVAnd you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago
p376
aVthat the royal family in England
p377
aVwere considered to have magical healing powers.
p378
aVSick children were held up in crowds
p379
aVto try and touch the cloak
p380
aVof the king or the queen to cure them
p381
aVof some terrible disease.
p382
aVIt wasn't like that in my day, but we still got very excited.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo it's a launch day, it's a Saturday,
p385
aVand my mother has dressed me up in my Sunday best.
p386
aVI'm not very happy with her.
p387
aVAll the kids are out in the street,
p388
aVand we have little Union Jacks to wave,
p389
aVand at the top of the hill,
p390
aVthere's a motorcycle cortege appears.
p391
aVIn the middle of the motorcycles,
p392
aVthere's a big, black Rolls-Royce.
p393
aVInside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother.
p394
aVThis is a big deal.
p395
aVSo the procession is moving
p396
aVat a stately pace down my street,
p397
aVand as it approaches my house,
p398
aVI start to wave my flag vigorously,
p399
aVand there is the Queen Mother.
p400
aVI see her, and she seems to see me.
p401
aVShe acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles.
p402
aVAnd I wave my flag even more vigorously.
p403
aVWe're having a moment,
p404
aVme and the Queen Mother.
p405
aVShe's acknowledged me.
p406
aVAnd then she's gone.
p407
aa(lp408
VWell, I wasn't cured of anything.
p409
aVIt was the opposite, actually.
p410
aVI was infected.
p411
aVI was infected with an idea.
p412
aVI don't belong in this street.
p413
aVI don't want to live in that house.
p414
aVI don't want to end up in that shipyard.
p415
aVI want to be in that car. (Laughter)
p416
aVI want a bigger life.
p417
aVI want a life beyond this town.
p418
aVI want a life that's out of the ordinary.
p419
aVIt's my right.
p420
aVIt's my right as much as hers.
p421
aVAnd so here I am at TED,
p422
aVI suppose to tell that story,
p423
aVand I think it's appropriate to say the obvious
p424
aVthat there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link
p425
aVbetween storytelling and community,
p426
aVbetween community and art,
p427
aVbetween community and science and technology,
p428
aVbetween community and economics.
p429
aVIt's my belief that
p430
aVabstract economic theory
p431
aVthat denies the needs of community
p432
aVor denies the contribution that community makes
p433
aVto economy is shortsighted, cruel
p434
aVand untenable.
p435
aa(lp436
V(Applause)
p437
aa(lp438
VThe fact is, whether you're a rock star
p439
aVor whether you're a welder in a shipyard,
p440
aVor a tribesman in the upper Amazon,
p441
aVor the queen of England,
p442
aVat the end of the day,
p443
aVwe're all in the same boat.
p444
aa(lp445
V\u266a Aye, the footmen are frantic in their indignation \u266a
p446
aa(lp447
V\u266a You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station \u266a
p448
aa(lp449
V\u266a Where the porters, surprised by her lack of royal baggage \u266a
p450
aa(lp451
V\u266a Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage \u266a
p452
aa(lp453
V\u266a For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility \u266a
p454
aa(lp455
V\u266a And there's none of them famous for their compatibility \u266a
p456
aa(lp457
V\u266a There's a fight over seats \u266a
p458
aa(lp459
V\u266a "I beg pardon, Your Grace \u266a
p460
aa(lp461
V\u266a But you'll find that one's mine, so get back in your place!" \u266a
p462
