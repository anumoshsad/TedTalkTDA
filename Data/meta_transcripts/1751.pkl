VWhen I was a young boy,
p4
aVI used to gaze through the microscope of my father
p5
aVat the insects in amber that he kept in the house.
p6
aVAnd they were remarkably well preserved,
p7
aVmorphologically just phenomenal.
p8
aVAnd we used to imagine that someday,
p9
aVthey would actually come to life
p10
aVand they would crawl out of the resin,
p11
aVand, if they could, they would fly away.
p12
aa(lp13
VIf you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not
p14
aVwe would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,
p15
aVI would have told you, it's unlikely.
p16
aVIf you had asked whether or not we would actually be able
p17
aVto revive an extinct species,
p18
aVI would have said, pipe dream.
p19
aVBut I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,
p20
aVto tell you that not only is the sequencing
p21
aVof extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,
p22
aVbut the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,
p23
aVmaybe not from the insects in amber \u2014
p24
aVin fact, this mosquito was actually used
p25
aVfor the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" \u2014
p26
aVbut from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains
p27
aVof woolly mammoths in the permafrost.
p28
aa(lp29
VWoollies are a particularly interesting,
p30
aVquintessential image of the Ice Age.
p31
aVThey were large. They were hairy.
p32
aVThey had large tusks, and we seem to have
p33
aVa very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.
p34
aVMaybe it's because elephants share
p35
aVmany things in common with us.
p36
aVThey bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.
p37
aVThey have social knits that are very close.
p38
aVOr maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,
p39
aVbecause elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa
p40
aVsome seven million years ago,
p41
aVand as habitats changed and environments changed,
p42
aVwe actually, like the elephants, migrated out
p43
aVinto Europe and Asia.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo the first large mammoth that appears on the scene
p46
aVis meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall
p47
aVweighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species
p48
aVand spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,
p49
aVacross the Bering land bridge
p50
aVand into parts of North America.
p51
aVAnd then, again, as climate changed as it always does,
p52
aVand new habitats opened up,
p53
aVwe had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species
p54
aVcalled trogontherii in Central Asia
p55
aVpushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.
p56
aVAnd the open grassland savannas of North America
p57
aVopened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,
p58
aVa large, hairless species in North America.
p59
aVAnd it was really only about 500,000 years later
p60
aVthat we had the arrival of the woolly,
p61
aVthe one that we all know and love so much,
p62
aVspreading from an East Beringian point of origin
p63
aVacross Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii
p64
aVout through Central Europe,
p65
aVand over hundreds of thousands of years
p66
aVmigrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge
p67
aVduring times of glacial peaks
p68
aVand coming into direct contact
p69
aVwith the Columbian relatives living in the south,
p70
aVand there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years
p71
aVduring traumatic climatic shifts.
p72
aVSo there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions
p73
aVin temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.
p74
aVAnd there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,
p75
aVand actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia
p76
aVand Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.
p77
aVSo Egyptians are building pyramids
p78
aVand woollies are still living on islands.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd then they disappear.
p81
aVLike 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,
p82
aVthey go extinct, likely due to a warming climate
p83
aVand fast-encroaching dense forests
p84
aVthat are migrating north,
p85
aVand also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,
p86
aVprobably Pleistocene overkill,
p87
aVso the large game hunters that took them down.
p88
aa(lp89
VFortunately, we find millions of their remains
p90
aVstrewn across the permafrost buried deep
p91
aVin Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there
p92
aVand actually take them out.
p93
aVAnd the preservation is, again,
p94
aVlike those insects in [amber], phenomenal.
p95
aVSo you have teeth, bones with blood
p96
aVwhich look like blood, you have hair,
p97
aVand you have intact carcasses or heads
p98
aVwhich still have brains in them.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo the preservation and the survival of DNA
p101
aVdepends on many factors, and I have to admit,
p102
aVmost of which we still don't quite understand,
p103
aVbut depending upon when an organism dies
p104
aVand how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,
p105
aVthe constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,
p106
aVwill ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive
p107
aVover geologically meaningful time frames.
p108
aVAnd it's probably surprising to many of you
p109
aVsitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,
p110
aVit's not the length of preservation,
p111
aVit's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo if we were to go deep now within the bones
p114
aVand the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,
p115
aVthe DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped
p116
aVaround histone proteins, is now under attack
p117
aVby the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth
p118
aVfor years during its lifetime.
p119
aVSo those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,
p120
aVfree water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA
p121
aVinto smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,
p122
aVuntil all you have are fragments that range
p123
aVfrom 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,
p124
aVa few hundred base pairs in length.
p125
aVSo most fossils out there in the fossil record
p126
aVare actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.
p127
aVBut a few of them actually have DNA fragments
p128
aVthat survive for thousands,
p129
aVeven a few millions of years in time.
p130
aVAnd using state-of-the-art clean room technology,
p131
aVwe've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs
p132
aVaway from all the rest of the gunk in there,
p133
aVand it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room
p134
aVthat if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth
p135
aVand I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,
p136
aVbut I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,
p137
aVand, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA
p138
aVthat survived in that environment with it,
p139
aVso the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.
p140
aVNot surprising then again that a mammoth
p141
aVpreserved in the permafrost will have something
p142
aVon the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,
p143
aVwhereas something like the Columbian mammoth,
p144
aVliving in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment
p145
aVover its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut we've come up with very clever ways
p148
aVthat we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,
p149
aVthe mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,
p150
aVand with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,
p151
aVwe can actually pull out and bioinformatically
p152
aVre-jig all these small mammoth fragments
p153
aVand place them onto a backbone
p154
aVof an Asian or African elephant chromosome.
p155
aVAnd so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points
p156
aVthat discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,
p157
aVand what do we know, then, about a mammoth?
p158
aa(lp159
VWell, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,
p160
aVand we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.
p161
aVSo a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,
p162
aVbut an elephant and mammoth genome
p163
aVis about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that
p164
aVis composed of small, repetitive DNAs
p165
aVthat make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo having this information allows us to answer
p168
aVone of the interesting relationship questions
p169
aVbetween mammoths and their living relatives,
p170
aVthe African and the Asian elephant,
p171
aVall of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,
p172
aVbut the genome of the mammoth shows it to share
p173
aVa most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants
p174
aVabout six million years ago,
p175
aVso slightly closer to the Asian elephant.
p176
aa(lp177
VWith advances in ancient DNA technology,
p178
aVwe can actually now start to begin to sequence
p179
aVthe genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,
p180
aVand I just wanted to talk about two of them,
p181
aVthe woolly and the Columbian mammoth,
p182
aVboth of which were living very close to each other
p183
aVduring glacial peaks,
p184
aVso when the glaciers were massive in North America,
p185
aVthe woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,
p186
aVand came into contact with the relatives living to the south,
p187
aVand there they shared refugia,
p188
aVand a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.
p189
aVIt looks like they were interbreeding.
p190
aVAnd that this is not an uncommon feature
p191
aVin Proboscideans, because it turns out
p192
aVthat large savanna male elephants will outcompete
p193
aVthe smaller forest elephants for their females.
p194
aVSo large, hairless Columbians
p195
aVoutcompeting the smaller male woollies.
p196
aVIt reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VSo this is not trivial, given the idea that we want
p201
aVto revive extinct species, because it turns out
p202
aVthat an African and an Asian elephant
p203
aVcan actually interbreed and have live young,
p204
aVand this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo
p205
aVin Chester, U.K., in 1978.
p206
aVSo that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,
p207
aVmodify them into all those positions we've actually now
p208
aVbeen able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,
p209
aVwe can put that into an enucleated cell,
p210
aVdifferentiate that into a stem cell,
p211
aVsubsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,
p212
aVartificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,
p213
aVand over a long and arduous procedure,
p214
aVactually bring back something that looks like this.
p215
aVNow, this wouldn't be an exact replica,
p216
aVbecause the short DNA fragments that I told you about
p217
aVwill prevent us from building the exact structure,
p218
aVbut it would make something that looked and felt
p219
aVvery much like a woolly mammoth did.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, when I bring up this with my friends,
p222
aVwe often talk about, well, where would you put it?
p223
aVWhere are you going to house a mammoth?
p224
aVThere's no climates or habitats suitable.
p225
aVWell, that's not actually the case.
p226
aVIt turns out that there are swaths of habitat
p227
aVin the north of Siberia and Yukon
p228
aVthat actually could house a mammoth.
p229
aVRemember, this was a highly plastic animal
p230
aVthat lived over tremendous climate variation.
p231
aVSo this landscape would be easily able to house it,
p232
aVand I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,
p233
aVthe boy in me, that would love to see
p234
aVthese majestic creatures walk across the permafrost
p235
aVof the north once again, but I do have to admit
p236
aVthat part of the adult in me sometimes wonders
p237
aVwhether or not we should.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you very much.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Applause)
p242
aa(lp243
VRyan Phelan: Don't go away.
p244
aVYou've left us with a question.
p245
aVI'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?"
p246
aVit feels like you're reticent there,
p247
aVand yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.
p248
aVWhat's your reticence?
p249
aa(lp250
VHendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.
p251
aVI think it's just that we have to think very deeply
p252
aVabout the implications, ramifications of our actions,
p253
aVand so as long as we have good, deep discussion
p254
aVlike we're having now, I think
p255
aVwe can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.
p256
aVBut I just want to make sure that we spend time
p257
aVthinking about why we're doing it first.
p258
aa(lp259
VRP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.
p260
aa(lp261
