VEvery weekend for as long as I can remember,
p4
aVmy father would get up on a Saturday,
p5
aVput on a worn sweatshirt
p6
aVand he'd scrape away
p7
aVat the squeaky old wheel of a house that we lived in.
p8
aVI wouldn't even call it restoration;
p9
aVit was a ritual, catharsis.
p10
aVHe would spend all year scraping paint with this old heat gun
p11
aVand a spackle knife,
p12
aVand then he would repaint where he scraped,
p13
aVonly to begin again the following year.
p14
aVScraping and re-scraping, painting and repainting:
p15
aVthe work of an old house is never meant to be done.
p16
aa(lp17
VThe day my father turned 52, I got a phone call.
p18
aVMy mother was on the line
p19
aVto tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach \u2014
p20
aVterminal cancer, she told me,
p21
aVand he had been given only three weeks to live.
p22
aa(lp23
VI immediately moved home to Poughkeepsie, New York,
p24
aVto sit with my father on death watch,
p25
aVnot knowing what the next days would bring us.
p26
aVTo keep myself distracted,
p27
aVI rolled up my sleeves,
p28
aVand I went about finishing what he could now no longer complete \u2014
p29
aVthe restoration of our old home.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhen that looming three-week deadline came
p32
aVand then went,
p33
aVhe was still alive.
p34
aVAnd at three months,
p35
aVhe joined me.
p36
aVWe gutted and repainted the interior.
p37
aVAt six months, the old windows were refinished,
p38
aVand at 18 months,
p39
aVthe rotted porch was finally replaced.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd there was my father,
p42
aVstanding with me outside, admiring a day's work,
p43
aVhair on his head, fully in remission,
p44
aVwhen he turned to me and he said,
p45
aV"You know, Michael,
p46
aVthis house saved my life."
p47
aa(lp48
VSo the following year, I decided to go to architecture school.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VBut there, I learned something different about buildings.
p53
aVRecognition seemed to come
p54
aVto those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms,
p55
aVlike ribbons, or ...
p56
aVpickles?
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I think this is supposed to be a snail.
p61
aa(lp62
VSomething about this bothered me.
p63
aVWhy was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture \u2014
p64
aVall beautiful and visionary and innovative \u2014
p65
aVis also so rare,
p66
aVand seems to serve so very few?
p67
aVAnd more to the point:
p68
aVWith all of this creative talent, what more could we do?
p69
aa(lp70
VJust as I was about to start my final exams,
p71
aVI decided to take a break from an all-nighter
p72
aVand go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,
p73
aVa leading health activist for the global poor.
p74
aVI was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture.
p75
aVBuildings are making people sicker, he said,
p76
aVand for the poorest in the world,
p77
aVthis is causing epidemic-level problems.
p78
aVIn this hospital in South Africa,
p79
aVpatients that came in with, say, a broken leg,
p80
aVto wait in this unventilated hallway,
p81
aVwalked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis.
p82
aVSimple designs for infection control had not been thought about,
p83
aVand people had died because of it.
p84
aa(lp85
V"Where are the architects?" Paul said.
p86
aVIf hospitals are making people sicker,
p87
aVwhere are the architects and designers
p88
aVto help us build and design hospitals that allow us to heal?
p89
aa(lp90
VThat following summer,
p91
aVI was in the back of a Land Rover with a few classmates,
p92
aVbumping over the mountainous hillside of Rwanda.
p93
aVFor the next year, I'd be living in Butaro in this old guesthouse,
p94
aVwhich was a jail after the genocide.
p95
aVI was there to design and build a new type of hospital
p96
aVwith Dr. Farmer and his team.
p97
aVIf hallways are making patients sicker,
p98
aVwhat if we could design a hospital that flips the hallways on the outside,
p99
aVand makes people walk in the exterior?
p100
aVIf mechanical systems rarely work,
p101
aVwhat if we could design a hospital that could breathe
p102
aVthrough natural ventilation,
p103
aVand meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd what about the patients' experience?
p106
aVEvidence shows that a simple view of nature
p107
aVcan radically improve health outcomes,
p108
aVSo why couldn't we design a hospital
p109
aVwhere every patient had a window with a view?
p110
aVSimple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals.
p111
aa(lp112
VDesigning it is one thing;
p113
aVgetting it built, we learned, is quite another.
p114
aa(lp115
VWe worked with Bruce Nizeye,
p116
aVa brilliant engineer,
p117
aVand he thought about construction differently
p118
aVthan I had been taught in school.
p119
aVWhen we had to excavate this enormous hilltop
p120
aVand a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site,
p121
aVBruce suggested doing it by hand,
p122
aVusing a method in Rwanda called "Ubudehe,"
p123
aVwhich means "community works for the community."
p124
aVHundreds of people came with shovels and hoes,
p125
aVand we excavated that hill
p126
aVin half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer.
p127
aVInstead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild,
p128
aVand he brought in master carpenters to train others
p129
aVin how to make furniture by hand.
p130
aVAnd on this job site,
p131
aV15 years after the Rwandan genocide,
p132
aVBruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds,
p133
aVand that half of them be women.
p134
aa(lp135
VBruce was using the process of building to heal,
p136
aVnot just for those who were sick,
p137
aVbut for the entire community as a whole.
p138
aVWe call this the locally fabricated way of building, or "lo-fab,"
p139
aVand it has four pillars:
p140
aVhire locally,
p141
aVsource regionally,
p142
aVtrain where you can
p143
aVand most importantly,
p144
aVthink about every design decision as an opportunity
p145
aVto invest in the dignity of the places where you serve.
p146
aVThink of it like the local food movement,
p147
aVbut for architecture.
p148
aVAnd we're convinced that this way of building
p149
aVcan be replicated across the world,
p150
aVand change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture.
p151
aa(lp152
VUsing the lo-fab way of building,
p153
aVeven aesthetic decisions can be designed to impact people's lives.
p154
aVIn Butaro, we chose to use a local volcanic stone
p155
aVfound in abundance within the area,
p156
aVbut often considered a nuisance by farmers,
p157
aVand piled on the side of the road.
p158
aVWe worked with these masons to cut these stones
p159
aVand form them into the walls of the hospital.
p160
aVAnd when they began on this corner
p161
aVand wrapped around the entire hospital,
p162
aVthey were so good at putting these stones together,
p163
aVthey asked us if they could take down the original wall and rebuild it.
p164
aVAnd you see what is possible.
p165
aVIt's beautiful.
p166
aVAnd the beauty, to me,
p167
aVcomes from the fact that I know that hands cut these stones,
p168
aVand they formed them into this thick wall,
p169
aVmade only in this place with rocks from this soil.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhen you go outside today and you look at your built world,
p172
aVask not only:
p173
aV"What is the environmental footprint?" \u2014 an important question \u2014
p174
aVbut what if we also asked,
p175
aV"What is the human handprint of those who made it?"
p176
aa(lp177
VWe started a new practice based around these questions,
p178
aVand we tested it around the world.
p179
aVLike in Haiti,
p180
aVwhere we asked if a new hospital could help end the epidemic of cholera.
p181
aVIn this 100-bed hospital,
p182
aVwe designed a simple strategy
p183
aVto clean contaminated medical waste before it enters the water table,
p184
aVand our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO
p185
aVare already saving lives because of it.
p186
aa(lp187
VOr Malawi:
p188
aVwe asked if a birthing center could radically reduce
p189
aVmaternal and infant mortality.
p190
aVMalawi has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant death
p191
aVin the world.
p192
aVUsing a simple strategy to be replicated nationally,
p193
aVwe designed a birthing center
p194
aVthat would attract women and their attendants
p195
aVto come to the hospital earlier and therefore have safer births.
p196
aa(lp197
VOr in the Congo, where we asked
p198
aVif an educational center could also be used
p199
aVto protect endangered wildlife.
p200
aVPoaching for ivory and bushmeat
p201
aVis leading to global epidemic, disease transfer and war.
p202
aVIn one of the hardest-to-reach places in the world,
p203
aVwe used the mud and the dirt and the wood around us
p204
aVto construct a center
p205
aVthat would show us ways to protect and conserve our rich biodiversity.
p206
aa(lp207
VEven here in the US,
p208
aVwe were asked to rethink
p209
aVthe largest university for the deaf and hard of hearing in the world.
p210
aVThe deaf community, through sign language,
p211
aVshows us the power of visual communication.
p212
aVWe designed a campus that would awaken the ways
p213
aVin which we as humans all communicate,
p214
aVboth verbally and nonverbally.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,
p217
aVwe thought about old industrial infrastructure.
p218
aVWe wondered:
p219
aVCould we use arts and culture and design to revitalize this city
p220
aVand other Rust Belt cities across our nation,
p221
aVand turn them into centers for innovation and growth?
p222
aVIn each of these projects, we asked a simple question:
p223
aVWhat more can architecture do?
p224
aVAnd by asking that question,
p225
aVwe were forced to consider how we could create jobs,
p226
aVhow we could source regionally
p227
aVand how we could invest in the dignity of the communities
p228
aVin which we serve.
p229
aa(lp230
VI have learned
p231
aVthat architecture can be a transformative engine for change.
p232
aa(lp233
VAbout a year ago, I read an article
p234
aVabout a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader
p235
aVnamed Bryan Stevenson.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd Bryan had a bold architectural vision.
p240
aVHe and his team had been documenting
p241
aVthe over 4,000 lynchings of African-Americans
p242
aVthat have happened in the American South.
p243
aVAnd they had a plan to mark every county where these lynchings occurred,
p244
aVand build a national memorial to the victims of lynching
p245
aVin Montgomery, Alabama.
p246
aa(lp247
VCountries like Germany and South Africa
p248
aVand, of course, Rwanda,
p249
aVhave found it necessary to build memorials
p250
aVto reflect on the atrocities of their past,
p251
aVin order to heal their national psyche.
p252
aVWe have yet to do this in the United States.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo I sent a cold email to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:
p255
aV"Dear Bryan," it said,
p256
aV"I think your building project
p257
aVis maybe the most important project we could do in America
p258
aVand could change the way we think about racial injustice.
p259
aVBy any chance,
p260
aVdo you know who will design it?"
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VSurprisingly, shockingly,
p265
aVBryan got right back to me,
p266
aVand invited me down to meet with his team and talk to them.
p267
aVNeedless to say, I canceled all my meetings
p268
aVand I jumped on a plane to Montgomery, Alabama.
p269
aVWhen I got there,
p270
aVBryan and his team picked me up, and we walked around the city.
p271
aVAnd they took the time to point out
p272
aVthe many markers that have been placed all over the city
p273
aVto the history of the Confederacy,
p274
aVand the very few that mark the history of slavery.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd then he walked me to a hill.
p277
aVIt overlooked the whole city.
p278
aVHe pointed out the river and the train tracks
p279
aVwhere the largest domestic slave-trading port in America
p280
aVhad once prospered.
p281
aVAnd then to the Capitol rotunda,
p282
aVwhere George Wallace had stood on its steps
p283
aVand proclaimed, "Segregation forever."
p284
aVAnd then to the very hill below us.
p285
aVHe said, "Here we will build a new memorial
p286
aVthat will change the identity of this city and of this nation."
p287
aa(lp288
VOur two teams have worked together over the last year
p289
aVto design this memorial.
p290
aVThe memorial will take us on a journey
p291
aVthrough a classical, almost familiar building type,
p292
aVlike the Parthenon or the colonnade at the Vatican.
p293
aVBut as we enter,
p294
aVthe ground drops below us and our perception shifts,
p295
aVwhere we realize that these columns evoke the lynchings,
p296
aVwhich happened in the public square.
p297
aVAnd as we continue,
p298
aVwe begin to understand the vast number
p299
aVof those who have yet to be put to rest.
p300
aVTheir names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us.
p301
aVAnd just outside will be a field of identical columns.
p302
aVBut these are temporary columns, waiting in purgatory,
p303
aVto be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred.
p304
aVOver the next few years,
p305
aVthis site will bear witness,
p306
aVas each of these markers is claimed
p307
aVand visibly placed in those counties.
p308
aVOur nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence.
p309
aa(lp310
VWhen we think about how it should be built,
p311
aVwe were reminded of Ubudehe,
p312
aVthe building process we learned about in Rwanda.
p313
aVWe wondered if we could fill those very columns
p314
aVwith the soil from the sites of where these killings occurred.
p315
aVBrian and his team have begun collecting that soil
p316
aVand preserving it in individual jars
p317
aVwith family members, community leaders and descendants.
p318
aVThe act of collecting soil itself
p319
aVhas lead to a type of spiritual healing.
p320
aVIt's an act of restorative justice.
p321
aa(lp322
VAs one EJI team member noted
p323
aVin the collection of the soil from where Will McBride was lynched,
p324
aV"If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,
p325
aVone drop of blood,
p326
aVone hair follicle \u2014
p327
aVI pray that I dug it up,
p328
aVand that his whole body would be at peace."
p329
aa(lp330
VWe plan to break ground on this memorial later this year,
p331
aVand it will be a place to finally speak of the unspeakable acts
p332
aVthat have scarred this nation.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VWhen my father told me that day that this house \u2014
p337
aVour house \u2014
p338
aVhad saved his life,
p339
aVwhat I didn't know
p340
aVwas that he was referring to a much deeper relationship
p341
aVbetween architecture and ourselves.
p342
aVBuildings are not simply expressive sculptures.
p343
aVThey make visible our personal and our collective aspirations
p344
aVas a society.
p345
aVGreat architecture can give us hope.
p346
aVGreat architecture can heal.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you very much.
