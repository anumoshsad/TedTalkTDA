VWhat I'm going to do is, I'm going to explain to you
p4
aVan extreme green concept
p5
aVthat was developed at NASA's Glenn Research Center
p6
aVin Cleveland, Ohio.
p7
aVBut before I do that, we have to go over
p8
aVthe definition of what green is,
p9
aV'cause a lot of us have a different definition of it.
p10
aVGreen. The product is created through
p11
aVenvironmentally and socially conscious means.
p12
aVThere's plenty of things that are being called green now.
p13
aVWhat does it actually mean?
p14
aVWe use three metrics to determine green.
p15
aVThe first metric is: Is it sustainable?
p16
aVWhich means, are you preserving what you are doing for future use
p17
aVor for future generations?
p18
aVIs it alternative? Is it different than what is being used today,
p19
aVor does it have a lower carbon footprint
p20
aVthan what's used conventionally?
p21
aVAnd three: Is it renewable?
p22
aVDoes it come from Earth's natural replenishing resources,
p23
aVsuch as sun, wind and water?
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, my task at NASA is to develop
p26
aVthe next generation of aviation fuels.
p27
aVExtreme green. Why aviation?
p28
aVThe field of aviation uses more fuel than just about
p29
aVevery other combined. We need to find an alternative.
p30
aVAlso it's a national aeronautics directive.
p31
aVOne of the national aeronautics goals is to develop
p32
aVthe next generation of fuels, biofuels,
p33
aVusing domestic and safe, friendly resources.
p34
aVNow, combating that challenge
p35
aVwe have to also meet the big three metric \u2014
p36
aVActually, extreme green for us is all three together;
p37
aVthat's why you see the plus there. I was told to say that.
p38
aVSo it has to be the big three at GRC. That's another metric.
p39
aVNinety-seven percent of the world's water is saltwater.
p40
aVHow about we use that? Combine that with number three.
p41
aVDo not use arable land.
p42
aVBecause crops are already growing on that land
p43
aVthat's very scarce around the world.
p44
aVNumber two: Don't compete with food crops.
p45
aVThat's already a well established entity, they don't need another entry.
p46
aVAnd lastly the most precious resource we have on this Earth
p47
aVis fresh water. Don't use fresh water.
p48
aVIf 97.5 percent of the world's water is saltwater,
p49
aV2.5 percent is fresh water. Less than a half percent
p50
aVof that is accessible for human use.
p51
aVBut 60 percent of the population lives within that one percent.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, combating my problem was, now I have to be extreme green
p54
aVand meet the big three. Ladies and gentlemen,
p55
aVwelcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.
p56
aVThis is a facility dedicated to the next generation
p57
aVof aviation fuels using halophytes.
p58
aVA halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.
p59
aVMost plants don't like salt, but halophytes tolerate salt.
p60
aVWe also are using weeds
p61
aVand we are also using algae.
p62
aVThe good thing about our lab is, we've had
p63
aV3,600 visitors in the last two years.
p64
aVWhy do you think that's so?
p65
aVBecause we are on to something special.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo, in the lower you see the GreenLab obviously,
p68
aVand on the right hand side you'll see algae.
p69
aVIf you are into the business of the next generation
p70
aVof aviation fuels, algae is a viable option,
p71
aVthere's a lot of funding right now,
p72
aVand we have an algae to fuels program.
p73
aVThere's two types of algae growing.
p74
aVOne is a closed photobioreactor that you see here,
p75
aVand what you see on the other side is our species \u2014
p76
aVwe are currently using a species called Scenedesmus dimorphus.
p77
aVOur job at NASA is to take the experimental and computational
p78
aVand make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors.
p79
aVNow the problems with closed photobioreactors are:
p80
aVThey are quite expensive, they are automated,
p81
aVand it's very difficult to get them in large scale.
p82
aVSo on large scale what do they use?
p83
aVWe use open pond systems. Now, around the world
p84
aVthey are growing algae, with this racetrack design
p85
aVthat you see here. Looks like an oval with
p86
aVa paddle wheel and mixes really well,
p87
aVbut when it gets around the last turn, which I call turn four \u2014 it's stagnant.
p88
aVWe actually have a solution for that.
p89
aVIn the GreenLab in our open pond system
p90
aVwe use something that happens in nature: waves.
p91
aVWe actually use wave technology on our open pond systems.
p92
aVWe have 95 percent mixing and our lipid content is higher
p93
aVthan a closed photobioreactor system,
p94
aVwhich we think is significant.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere is a drawback to algae, however: It's very expensive.
p97
aVIs there a way to produce algae inexpensively?
p98
aVAnd the answer is: yes.
p99
aVWe do the same thing we do with halophytes,
p100
aVand that is: climatic adaptation.
p101
aVIn our GreenLab we have six primary ecosystems
p102
aVthat range from freshwater all the way to saltwater.
p103
aVWhat we do: We take a potential species, we start at freshwater,
p104
aVwe add a little bit more salt, when the second tank here
p105
aVwill be the same ecosystem as Brazil \u2014
p106
aVright next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants \u2014
p107
aVthe next tank represents Africa, the next tank represents Arizona,
p108
aVthe next tank represents Florida,
p109
aVand the next tank represents California or the open ocean.
p110
aVWhat we are trying to do is to come up with a single species
p111
aVthat can survive anywhere in the world, where there's barren desert.
p112
aVWe are being very successful so far.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, here's one of the problems.
p115
aVIf you are a farmer, you need five things to be successful: You need seeds,
p116
aVyou need soil, you need water and you need sun,
p117
aVand the last thing that you need is fertilizer.
p118
aVMost people use chemical fertilizers. But guess what?
p119
aVWe do not use chemical fertilizer.
p120
aVWait a second! I just saw lots of greenery in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.
p121
aVBelieve it or not, in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems
p122
aV80 percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves.
p123
aVThe 20 percent that's missing is nitrogen and phosphorous.
p124
aVWe have a natural solution: fish.
p125
aVNo we don't cut up the fish and put them in there.
p126
aVFish waste is what we use. As a matter of fact
p127
aVwe use freshwater mollies, that we've used our climatic adaptation technique
p128
aVfrom freshwater all the way to seawater.
p129
aVFreshwater mollies: cheap, they love to make babies,
p130
aVand they love to go to the bathroom.
p131
aVAnd the more they go to the bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,
p132
aVthe better off we are, believe it or not.
p133
aVIt should be noted that we use sand as our soil,
p134
aVregular beach sand. Fossilized coral.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo a lot of people ask me, "How did you get started?"
p137
aVWell, we got started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab.
p138
aVIt's a seedling lab. We have 26 different species of halophytes,
p139
aVand five are winners. What we do here is \u2014
p140
aVactually it should be called a death lab, 'cause we try to
p141
aVkill the seedlings, make them rough \u2014
p142
aVand then we come to the GreenLab.
p143
aVWhat you see in the lower corner
p144
aVis a wastewater treatment plant experiment
p145
aVthat we are growing, a macro-algae that I'll talk about in a minute.
p146
aVAnd lastly, it's me actually working in the lab to prove to you I do work,
p147
aVI don't just talk about what I do.
p148
aVHere's the plant species. Salicornia virginica.
p149
aVIt's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.
p150
aVEverywhere we go we see it. It's all over the place, from Maine
p151
aVall the way to California. We love that plant.
p152
aVSecond is Salicornia bigelovii. Very difficult to get around the world.
p153
aVIt is the highest lipid content that we have,
p154
aVbut it has a shortcoming: It's short.
p155
aVNow you take europaea, which is the largest or the tallest plant that we have.
p156
aVAnd what we are trying to do
p157
aVwith natural selection or adaptive biology \u2014 combine all three
p158
aVto make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.
p159
aVNext, when a hurricane decimated the Delaware Bay \u2014 soybean fields gone \u2014
p160
aVwe came up with an idea: Can you have a plant
p161
aVthat has a land reclamation positive in Delaware? And the answer is yes.
p162
aVIt's called seashore mallow. Kosteletzkya virginica \u2014
p163
aVsay that five times fast if you can.
p164
aVThis is a 100 percent usable plant. The seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.
p165
aVIt's there for 10 years; it's working very well.
p166
aVNow we get to Chaetomorpha.
p167
aVThis is a macro-algae that loves
p168
aVexcess nutrients. If you are in the aquarium industry
p169
aVyou know we use it to clean up dirty tanks.
p170
aVThis species is so significant to us.
p171
aVThe properties are very close to plastic.
p172
aVWe are trying right now to convert this macro-algae into a bioplastic.
p173
aVIf we are successful, we will revolutionize the plastics industry.
p174
aa(lp175
VSo, we have a seed to fuel program.
p176
aVWe have to do something with this biomass that we have.
p177
aVAnd so we do G.C. extraction, lipid optimization, so on and so forth,
p178
aVbecause our goal really is to come up with
p179
aVthe next generation of aviation fuels, aviation specifics, so on and so forth.
p180
aVSo far we talked about water and fuel,
p181
aVbut along the way we found out something interesting about Salicornia:
p182
aVIt's a food product.
p183
aVSo we talk about ideas worth spreading, right?
p184
aVHow about this: In sub-Saharan Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,
p185
aVbarren desert, how about we take that plant,
p186
aVplant it, half use for food, half use for fuel.
p187
aVWe can make that happen, inexpensively.
p188
aVYou can see there's a greenhouse in Germany
p189
aVthat sells it as a health food product.
p190
aVThis is harvested, and in the middle here is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.
p191
aVSo I have to tell you a joke. Salicornia is known as sea beans,
p192
aVsaltwater asparagus and pickle weed.
p193
aVSo we are pickling pickle weed in the middle.
p194
aVOh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)
p195
aVAnd at the bottom is seaman's mustard. It does make sense,
p196
aVthis is a logical snack. You have mustard,
p197
aVyou are a seaman, you see the halophyte, you mix it together,
p198
aVit's a great snack with some crackers.
p199
aVAnd last, garlic with Salicornia, which is what I like.
p200
aVSo, water, fuel and food.
p201
aa(lp202
VNone of this is possible without the GreenLab team.
p203
aVJust like the Miami Heat has the big three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.
p204
aVThat's myself, professor Bob Hendricks, our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.
p205
aVThe backbone of the GreenLab is students.
p206
aVOver the last two years we've had 35 different students
p207
aVfrom around the world working at GreenLab.
p208
aVAs a matter fact my division chief says a lot, "You have a green university."
p209
aVI say, "I'm okay with that, 'cause we are nurturing
p210
aVthe next generation of extreme green thinkers, which is significant."
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, in first summary I presented to you what we think
p213
aVis a global solution for food, fuel and water.
p214
aVThere's something missing to be complete.
p215
aVClearly we use electricity. We have a solution for you \u2014
p216
aVWe're using clean energy sources here.
p217
aVSo, we have two wind turbines connected to the GreenLab,
p218
aVwe have four or five more hopefully coming soon.
p219
aVWe are also using something that is quite interesting \u2014
p220
aVthere is a solar array field at NASA's Glenn Research Center,
p221
aVhasn't been used for 15 years.
p222
aVAlong with some of my electrical engineering colleagues,
p223
aVwe realized that they are still viable,
p224
aVso we are refurbishing them right now.
p225
aVIn about 30 days or so they'll be connected to the GreenLab.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd the reason why you see red, red and yellow, is
p228
aVa lot of people think NASA employees don't work on Saturday \u2014
p229
aVThis is a picture taken on Saturday.
p230
aVThere are no cars around, but you see my truck in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)
p231
aVThis is a proof to you that I'm working.
p232
aV'Cause we do what it takes to get the job done, most people know that.
p233
aVHere's a concept with this:
p234
aVWe are using the GreenLab for a micro-grid test bed
p235
aVfor the smart grid concept in Ohio.
p236
aVWe have the ability to do that, and I think it's going to work.
p237
aVSo, GreenLab Research Facility.
p238
aVA self-sustainable renewable energy ecosystem was presented today.
p239
aVWe really, really hope this concept catches on worldwide.
p240
aVWe think we have a solution for food, water, fuel and now energy. Complete.
p241
aVIt's extreme green, it's sustainable, alternative and renewable
p242
aVand it meets the big three at GRC:
p243
aVDon't use arable land, don't compete with food crops,
p244
aVand most of all, don't use fresh water.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo I get a lot of questions about, "What are you doing in that lab?"
p247
aVAnd I usually say, "None of your business, that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)
p248
aVAnd believe it or not, my number one goal
p249
aVfor working on this project is
p250
aVI want to help save the world.
