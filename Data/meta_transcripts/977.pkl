VOne of my favorite parts
p4
aVof my job at the Gates Foundation
p5
aVis that I get to travel to the developing world,
p6
aVand I do that quite regularly.
p7
aVAnd when I meet the mothers
p8
aVin so many of these remote places,
p9
aVI'm really struck by the things
p10
aVthat we have in common.
p11
aVThey want what we want for our children
p12
aVand that is for their children to grow up successful,
p13
aVto be healthy, and to have a successful life.
p14
aVBut I also see lots of poverty,
p15
aVand it's quite jarring,
p16
aVboth in the scale and the scope of it.
p17
aVMy first trip in India, I was in a person's home
p18
aVwhere they had dirt floors, no running water,
p19
aVno electricity,
p20
aVand that's really what I see all over the world.
p21
aVSo in short, I'm startled by all the things
p22
aVthat they don't have.
p23
aVBut I am surprised by one thing that they do have:
p24
aVCoca-Cola.
p25
aa(lp26
VCoke is everywhere.
p27
aVIn fact, when I travel to the developing world,
p28
aVCoke feels ubiquitous.
p29
aVAnd so when I come back from these trips,
p30
aVand I'm thinking about development,
p31
aVand I'm flying home and I'm thinking,
p32
aV"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"
p33
aVyou know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:
p34
aVhow is it that they can get Coke
p35
aVto these far-flung places?
p36
aVIf they can do that,
p37
aVwhy can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
p38
aVAnd I'm not the first person to ask this question.
p39
aVBut I think, as a community,
p40
aVwe still have a lot to learn.
p41
aVIt's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
p42
aVThey sell 1.5 billion servings
p43
aVevery single day.
p44
aVThat's like every man, woman and child on the planet
p45
aVhaving a serving of Coke every week.
p46
aVSo why does this matter?
p47
aVWell, if we're going to speed up the progress
p48
aVand go even faster
p49
aVon the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,
p50
aVwe need to learn from the innovators,
p51
aVand those innovators
p52
aVcome from every single sector.
p53
aVI feel that, if we can understand
p54
aVwhat makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,
p55
aVwe can apply those lessons then for the public good.
p56
aa(lp57
VCoke's success is relevant,
p58
aVbecause if we can analyze it, learn from it,
p59
aVthen we can save lives.
p60
aVSo that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
p61
aVAnd I think there are really three things
p62
aVwe can take away from Coca-Cola.
p63
aVThey take real-time data
p64
aVand immediately feed it back into the product.
p65
aVThey tap into local entrepreneurial talent,
p66
aVand they do incredible marketing.
p67
aVSo let's start with the data.
p68
aVNow Coke has a very clear bottom line \u2014
p69
aVthey report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
p70
aVSo they take the data,
p71
aVand they use it to measure progress.
p72
aVThey have this very continuous feedback loop.
p73
aVThey learn something, they put it back into the product,
p74
aVthey put it back into the market.
p75
aVThey have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
p76
aVIt's a lot like other consumer companies.
p77
aVSo if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,
p78
aVand you have a 107 constituencies,
p79
aVyou know where every can versus bottle
p80
aVof Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,
p81
aVwhether it was a corner store,
p82
aVa supermarket or a pushcart.
p83
aVSo if sales start to drop,
p84
aVthen the person can identify the problem
p85
aVand address the issue.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet's contrast that for a minute to development.
p88
aVIn development, the evaluation comes
p89
aVat the very end of the project.
p90
aVI've sat in a lot of those meetings,
p91
aVand by then,
p92
aVit is way too late to use the data.
p93
aVI had somebody from an NGO
p94
aVonce describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
p95
aVThey said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
p96
aVIt's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,
p97
aVand then you an see your impact."
p98
aVReal-time data
p99
aVturns on the lights.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo what's the second thing that Coke's good at?
p102
aVThey're good at tapping into
p103
aVthat local entrepreneurial talent.
p104
aVCoke's been in Africa since 1928,
p105
aVbut most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,
p106
aVbecause they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,
p107
aVwhich was a large truck rolling down the street.
p108
aVAnd in Africa, the remote places,
p109
aVit's hard to find a good road.
p110
aVBut Coke noticed something \u2014
p111
aVthey noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk
p112
aVand then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
p113
aVAnd so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
p114
aVAnd they decided in 1990
p115
aVthat they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,
p116
aVgiving them small loans.
p117
aVThey set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,
p118
aVand those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,
p119
aVwho go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows
p120
aVto sell the product.
p121
aVThere are now some 3,000 of these centers
p122
aVemploying about 15,000 people in Africa.
p123
aVIn Tanzania and Uganda,
p124
aVthey represent 90 percent
p125
aVof Coke's sales.
p126
aVLet's look at the development side.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhat is it that governments and NGOs
p129
aVcan learn from Coke?
p130
aVGovernments and NGOs
p131
aVneed to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,
p132
aVbecause the locals know how to reach
p133
aVthe very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,
p134
aVand they know what motivates them to make change.
p135
aVI think a great example of this
p136
aVis Ethiopia's new health extension program.
p137
aVThe government noticed in Ethiopia
p138
aVthat many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,
p139
aVthey were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
p140
aVSo if you're in an emergency situation \u2014 or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby \u2014
p141
aVforget it, to get to the health care center.
p142
aVThey decided that wasn't good enough,
p143
aVso they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala
p144
aVthat also had a system like this,
p145
aVand they adapted it for Ethiopia.
p146
aVAnd in 2003, the government of Ethiopia
p147
aVstarted this new system in their own country.
p148
aVThey trained 35,000 health extension workers
p149
aVto deliver care directly to the people.
p150
aVIn just five years,
p151
aVtheir ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people
p152
aVto one worker for every 2,500 people.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, think about
p155
aVhow this can change people's lives.
p156
aVHealth extension workers can help with so many things,
p157
aVwhether it's family planning, prenatal care,
p158
aVimmunizations for the children,
p159
aVor advising the woman to get to the facility on time
p160
aVfor an on-time delivery.
p161
aVThat is having real impact
p162
aVin a country like Ethiopia,
p163
aVand it's why you see their child mortality numbers
p164
aVcoming down 25 percent
p165
aVfrom 2000 to 2008.
p166
aVIn Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living
p167
aVbecause of this health extension worker program.
p168
aVSo what's the next step for Ethiopia?
p169
aVWell, they're already starting talk about this.
p170
aVThey're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers
p171
aVgenerate their own ideas?
p172
aVHow do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting
p173
aVout in those remote villages?"
p174
aVThat's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent
p175
aVand you unlock people's potential.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe third component of Coke's success
p178
aVis marketing.
p179
aVUltimately, Coke's success
p180
aVdepends on one crucial fact
p181
aVand that is that people want
p182
aVa Coca-Cola.
p183
aVNow the reason these micro-entrepreneurs
p184
aVcan sell or make a profit
p185
aVis they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
p186
aVSo, they rely on Coca-Cola
p187
aVin terms of its marketing,
p188
aVand what's the secret to their marketing?
p189
aVWell, it's aspirational.
p190
aVIt is associated that product
p191
aVwith a kind of life that people want to live.
p192
aVSo even though it's a global company,
p193
aVthey take a very local approach.
p194
aVCoke's global campaign slogan
p195
aVis "Open Happiness."
p196
aVBut they localize it.
p197
aVAnd they don't just guess what makes people happy;
p198
aVthey go to places like Latin America
p199
aVand they realize that happiness there
p200
aVis associated with family life.
p201
aVAnd in South Africa,
p202
aVthey associate happiness
p203
aVwith seriti or community respect.
p204
aVNow, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
p205
aVLet's listen to this song that Coke created for it,
p206
aV"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Video) K'Naan: \u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p209
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh \u266b
p210
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p211
aV\u266b Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh \u266b
p212
aV\u266bGive you freedom, give you fire\u266b
p213
aV\u266b Give you reason, take you higher \u266b
p214
aV\u266b See the champions take the field now \u266b
p215
aV\u266b You define us, make us feel proud \u266b
p216
aV\u266b In the streets our heads are lifted \u266b
p217
aV\u266b As we lose our inhibition \u266b
p218
aV\u266b Celebration, it's around us \u266b
p219
aV\u266b Every nation, all around us \u266b
p220
aa(lp221
VMelinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?
p222
aVWell, they didn't stop there \u2014
p223
aVthey localized it into 18 different languages.
p224
aVAnd it went number one on the pop chart
p225
aVin 17 countries.
p226
aVIt reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,
p227
aV"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"
p228
aVthat also went number one on the pop charts.
p229
aVBoth songs have something in common:
p230
aVthat same appeal
p231
aVof celebration and unity.
p232
aVSo how does health and development market?
p233
aVWell, it's based on avoidance,
p234
aVnot aspirations.
p235
aVI'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
p236
aV"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
p237
aV"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
p238
aVIt doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd I think we make a fundamental mistake \u2014
p241
aVwe make an assumption,
p242
aVthat we think that, if people need something,
p243
aVwe don't have to make them want that.
p244
aVAnd I think that's a mistake.
p245
aVAnd there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
p246
aVOne example is sanitation.
p247
aVWe know that a million and a half children
p248
aVdie a year from diarrhea
p249
aVand a lot of it is because of open defecation.
p250
aVBut there's a solution: you build a toilet.
p251
aVBut what we're finding around the world, over and over again,
p252
aVis, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,
p253
aVit doesn't get used.
p254
aVPeople reuse it for a slab for their home.
p255
aVThey sometimes store grain in it.
p256
aVI've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVBut what does marketing really entail
p259
aVthat would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
p260
aVWell, you work with the community.
p261
aVYou start to talk to them about why open defecation
p262
aVis something that shouldn't be done in the village,
p263
aVand they agree to that.
p264
aVBut then you take the toilet and you position it
p265
aVas a modern, trendy convenience.
p266
aVOne state in Northern India has gone so far
p267
aVas to link toilets to courtship.
p268
aVAnd it works \u2014 look at these headlines.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVI'm not kidding.
p271
aVWomen are refusing to marry men without toilets.
p272
aVNo loo, no "I do."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, it's not just a funny headline \u2014
p277
aVit's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
p278
aVBut more importantly,
p279
aVit saves lives.
p280
aVTake a look at this \u2014
p281
aVthis is a room full of young men
p282
aVand my husband, Bill.
p283
aVAnd can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
p284
aVThey're waiting to be circumcised.
p285
aVCan you you believe that?
p286
aVWe know that circumcision reduces HIV infection
p287
aVby 60 percent in men.
p288
aVAnd when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,
p289
aVI have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit
p290
aVand we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
p291
aVBut it turns out the men do,
p292
aVbecause they're hearing from their girlfriends
p293
aVthat they prefer it,
p294
aVand the men also believe it improves their sex life.
p295
aVSo if we can start to understand
p296
aVwhat people really want
p297
aVin health and development,
p298
aVwe can change communities
p299
aVand we can change whole nations.
p300
aa(lp301
VWell, why is all of this so important?
p302
aVSo let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,
p303
aVwhen you tie the three things together.
p304
aVAnd polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
p305
aVWe've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
p306
aVSo if you look back to 1988,
p307
aVthere are about 350,000 cases of polio
p308
aVon the planet that year.
p309
aVIn 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
p310
aVWell how did that happen?
p311
aVLet's look at a country like India.
p312
aVThey have over a billion people in this country,
p313
aVbut they have 35,000 local doctors
p314
aVwho report paralysis,
p315
aVand clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
p316
aVThey have two and a half million vaccinators.
p317
aVBut let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
p318
aVLet me tell you the story of Shriram,
p319
aVan 18 month boy in Bihar,
p320
aVa northern state in India.
p321
aVThis year on August 8th, he felt paralysis
p322
aVand on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
p323
aVOn August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,
p324
aVand by the 25th of August,
p325
aVit was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
p326
aVBy August 30th, a genetic test was done,
p327
aVand we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
p328
aa(lp329
VNow it could have come from one of two places.
p330
aVIt could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,
p331
aVor from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
p332
aVLuckily, the genetic testing proved
p333
aVthat, in fact, this strand came north,
p334
aVbecause, had it come from the south,
p335
aVit would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
p336
aVSo many more people would have been affected.
p337
aVSo what's the endgame?
p338
aVWell on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,
p339
aVwhich is what you do in polio.
p340
aVThey went out and where Shriram lives,
p341
aVthey vaccinated two million people.
p342
aVSo in less than a month,
p343
aVwe went from one case of paralysis
p344
aVto a targeted vaccination program.
p345
aVAnd I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
p346
aVThat's how you keep
p347
aVa huge outbreak from spreading,
p348
aVand it shows what can happen
p349
aVwhen local people have the data in their hands;
p350
aVthey can save lives.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,
p353
aVbut it might not be what you think.
p354
aVIt's not the marketing on the ground.
p355
aVIt's not telling the parents,
p356
aV"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor
p357
aVor get your child vaccinated."
p358
aVWe have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
p359
aVThe G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio
p360
aVover the last 20 years,
p361
aVbut we're starting to have something called polio fatigue
p362
aVand that is that the donor nations
p363
aVaren't willing to fund polio any longer.
p364
aVSo by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
p365
aVSo we are 99 percent
p366
aVof the way there on this goal
p367
aVand we're about to run short of money.
p368
aVAnd I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,
p369
aVif we could focus as a community
p370
aVon how far we've come
p371
aVand how amazing it would be
p372
aVto eradicate this disease,
p373
aVwe could put polio fatigue
p374
aVand polio behind us.
p375
aVAnd if we could do that,
p376
aVwe could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,
p377
aVin all of our countries for polio.
p378
aVAnd it would only be the second disease ever
p379
aVwiped off the face of the planet.
p380
aVAnd we are so close.
p381
aVAnd this victory is so possible.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo if Coke's marketers came to me
p384
aVand asked me to define happiness,
p385
aVI'd say my vision of happiness
p386
aVis a mother holding healthy baby
p387
aVin her arms.
p388
aVTo me, that is deep happiness.
p389
aVAnd so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,
p390
aVthen in the future we make together,
p391
aVthat happiness
p392
aVcan be just as ubiquitous
p393
aVas Coca-Cola.
