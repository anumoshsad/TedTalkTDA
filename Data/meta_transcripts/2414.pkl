VI'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer
p4
aVwith National Geographic,
p5
aVbut I want to share a secret.
p6
aVThis image is totally incorrect,
p7
aVtotally incorrect.
p8
aVI see a couple of people crying in the back
p9
aVthat I've blown their idea of mermaids.
p10
aVAll right, the mermaid is indeed real,
p11
aVbut anyone who's gone on a dive
p12
aVwill know that the ocean looks more like this.
p13
aVIt's because the ocean is this massive filter,
p14
aVand as soon as you start going underwater,
p15
aVyou're going to lose your colors,
p16
aVand it's going to get dark and blue very quickly.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut we're humans \u2014 we're terrestrial mammals.
p19
aVAnd we've got trichromatic vision,
p20
aVso we see in red, green and blue,
p21
aVand we're just complete color addicts.
p22
aVWe love eye-popping color,
p23
aVand we try to bring this eye-popping color
p24
aVunderwater with us.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater,
p27
aVand it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,
p28
aVwho were trying to take the first underwater color photograph.
p29
aVAnd they're in there with old-school scuba suits,
p30
aVwhere you're pumping air down to them,
p31
aVand they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder,
p32
aVand the poor people at the surface are not sure
p33
aVwhen they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus,
p34
aVand \u2014 boom! \u2014 a pound of high explosives would go off
p35
aVso they could put a little bit of light underwater
p36
aVand get an image like this beautiful hogfish.
p37
aVI mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real.
p38
aVThey're creating an artificial environment
p39
aVso we can satisfy our own addiction to color.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd looking at it the other way, what we've been finding
p42
aVis that instead of bringing color underwater with us,
p43
aVthat we've been looking at the blue ocean,
p44
aVand it's a crucible of blue,
p45
aVand these animals living there for millions of years
p46
aVhave been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light
p47
aVand give off other colors.
p48
aVAnd here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like.
p49
aVIt's like an underwater light show.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
VAgain, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image.
p54
aVThese animals are absorbing the blue light
p55
aVand immediately transforming this light.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet,
p58
aVand blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters.
p59
aVAs we go down underwater,
p60
aVafter about 10 meters, all the red is gone.
p61
aVSo if you see anything under 10 meters that's red,
p62
aVit's an animal transforming and creating its own red.
p63
aVThis is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals.
p66
aVAnd I want to give a full TED Talk on corals
p67
aVand just how cool these things are.
p68
aVOne of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats,
p69
aVis they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins,
p70
aVfluorescent molecules.
p71
aVAnd in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass \u2014
p72
aVcould be this fluorescent protein.
p73
aVSo you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it,
p74
aVso it's likely doing something that has a functional role.
p75
aVAnd for the last 10, 15 years, this was so special to me,
p76
aVbecause this molecule has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary tools
p77
aVin biomedical science,
p78
aVand it's allowing us to better see inside ourselves.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, how do I study this?
p81
aVIn order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night.
p82
aVAnd when I started out,
p83
aVI was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe,
p84
aVso I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light
p85
aVthat's being transformed by the animals.
p86
aVWe're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History,
p87
aVand we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef,
p88
aVand something happened that just blew me away:
p89
aVthis.
p90
aVIn the middle of our corals,
p91
aVis this green fluorescent fish.
p92
aVIt's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish
p93
aVor any vertebrate for that matter.
p94
aVAnd we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters,
p95
aVthinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera,
p96
aVbut the eel was real.
p97
aa(lp98
VIt was the first green fluorescent eel that we found,
p99
aVand this just changed my trajectory completely.
p100
aVSo I had to put down my corals and team up
p101
aVwith a fish scientist, John Sparks,
p102
aVand begin a search around the world
p103
aVto see how prevalent this phenomenon is.
p104
aVAnd fish are much more interesting than corals,
p105
aVbecause they have really advanced vision,
p106
aVand some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it,
p107
aVthey have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence.
p108
aVSo I wanted to seek this out further.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo we designed a new set of gear
p111
aVand we're scouring the reefs around the world,
p112
aVlooking for fluorescent life.
p113
aVAnd it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."
p114
aVWe're out there swimming with this blue light,
p115
aVand we're looking for a response,
p116
aVfor animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us.
p117
aVAnd eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.
p118
aVIt's a really shy, reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about.
p119
aVThey're only about the size of my finger,
p120
aVand they spend about 99.9 percent of their time hidden under a rock.
p121
aVBut these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights,
p122
aVand that full-moon night translates underwater to blue.
p123
aVPerhaps they're using this as a way to see each other,
p124
aVquickly find each other, mate,
p125
aVgo back into their hole for the next long stint of time.
p126
aVBut then we started to find other fluorescent marine life,
p127
aVlike this green fluorescent bream,
p128
aVwith its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape,
p129
aVand it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity
p130
aVas the fluorescent coral there.
p131
aa(lp132
VAfter this fish,
p133
aVwe were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish
p134
aVcloaked and hidden on this rock.
p135
aVThe only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae
p136
aVor red fluorescent coral.
p137
aa(lp138
VLater, we found this stealthy green fluorescent lizardfish.
p139
aVThese lizardfish come in many varieties,
p140
aVand they look almost exactly alike under white light.
p141
aVBut if you look at them under fluorescent light,
p142
aVyou see lots of patterns,
p143
aVyou can really see the differences among them.
p144
aVAnd in total \u2014 we just reported this last year \u2014
p145
aVwe found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish.
p146
aa(lp147
VOne of my inspirations is French artist and biologist Jean Painlevé.
p148
aVHe really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology.
p149
aVHe would design his own gear, make his own cameras,
p150
aVand he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus,
p151
aVand he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth.
p152
aVSo this is the male seahorse.
p153
aVThey were one of the first fish to start swimming upright
p154
aVwith their brain above their head.
p155
aVThe males give birth,
p156
aVjust phenomenal creatures.
p157
aVSo he stayed awake for days.
p158
aVHe even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him,
p159
aVso he could capture this moment.
p160
aVNow, I wish I could have shown Painlevé
p161
aVthe moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses
p162
aVin the exact same species that he was studying.
p163
aVAnd here's our footage.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Music)
p166
aa(lp167
VThey're the most cryptic fish.
p168
aVYou could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
p169
aVThey would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red,
p170
aVbut they've got great vision,
p171
aVand they go through this long mating ritual,
p172
aVand perhaps they're using it in that effect.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut things got pretty edgy
p175
aVwhen we found green fluorescence in the stingray,
p176
aVbecause stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class,
p177
aVwhich includes ...
p178
aVsharks.
p179
aVSo I'm, like, a coral biologist.
p180
aVSomebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent.
p181
aVAnd there I am.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals."
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VIt turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent.
p190
aVAnd then we found it.
p191
aVIn a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California,
p192
aVwe found the first biofluorescent swellshark,
p193
aVright underneath all the surfers.
p194
aVHere it is.
p195
aVThey're just about a meter long. It's called a swellshark.
p196
aVAnd they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened,
p197
aVthey can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube,
p198
aVabout twice their size,
p199
aVand wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator.
p200
aVAnd here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks.
p201
aVJust magnificent \u2014 I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns,
p202
aVand there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent,
p203
aVbut they've also got these twinkling spots on them
p204
aVthat are much brighter than other parts of the shark.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut this is all beautiful to see.
p207
aVI was like, this is gorgeous.
p208
aVBut what does it mean to the shark?
p209
aVCan they see this?
p210
aVAnd we looked in the literature,
p211
aVand nothing was known about this shark's vision.
p212
aVSo I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University,
p213
aVand we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely
p214
aVin the blue-green interface,
p215
aVprobably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark,
p216
aVbut they only see blue-green.
p217
aVSo what it's doing is taking this blue world
p218
aVand it's absorbing the blue, creating green.
p219
aVIt's creating contrast that they can indeed see.
p220
aVSo we have a model,
p221
aVshowing that it creates an ability for them to see all these patterns.
p222
aVAnd males and females also have, we're finding,
p223
aVdistinct patterns among them.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now,
p226
aVin the Solomon Islands.
p227
aVSwimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle.
p228
aVSo now it's going from fish and sharks into reptiles,
p229
aVwhich, again, this is only one month old,
p230
aVbut it shows us that we know almost nothing
p231
aVabout this hawksbill turtle's vision.
p232
aVAnd it makes me think about how much more there is to learn.
p233
aVAnd here in the Solomon Islands,
p234
aVthere's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left,
p235
aVand this is one of the hotspots for them.
p236
aVSo it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals
p237
aVwhile they're still here, and understand them.
p238
aa(lp239
VIn thinking about biofluorescence,
p240
aVI wanted to know, how deep does it go?
p241
aVDoes this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean?
p242
aVSo we started using submarines, and we equipped them
p243
aVwith special blue lights on the front here.
p244
aVAnd we dropped down,
p245
aVand we noticed one important thing \u2014
p246
aVthat as we get down to 1,000 meters,
p247
aVit drops off.
p248
aVThere's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters \u2014
p249
aValmost nothing, it's just darkness.
p250
aVSo it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.
p251
aVAnd below 1,000 meters,
p252
aVwe encountered the bioluminescent zone,
p253
aVwhere nine out of 10 animals are actually making their own lights
p254
aVand flashing and blinking.
p255
aa(lp256
VAs I try to get deeper,
p257
aVthis is slapping on a one-person submarine suit \u2014
p258
aVsome people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VBut as we explore down here,
p263
aVI was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately?
p264
aVBecause we're entering a new age of exploration,
p265
aVwhere we have to take great care,
p266
aVand we have to set examples how we explore.
p267
aVSo I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University,
p268
aVand we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers,
p269
aVso we can delicately interact with the marine life down there.
p270
aVThe idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean
p271
aVcome from oil and gas and military,
p272
aVwho, you know, they're not really caring to be gentle.
p273
aVSome corals could be 1,000 years old.
p274
aVYou don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw.
p275
aVSo my dream is something like this.
p276
aVAt night, I'm in a submarine,
p277
aVI have force-feedback gloves,
p278
aVand I could delicately set up a lab in the front of my submarine,
p279
aVwhere the squishy robot fingers
p280
aVare delicately collecting and putting things in jars,
p281
aVand we can conduct our research.
p282
aa(lp283
VBack to the powerful applied applications.
p284
aVHere, you're looking at a living brain
p285
aVthat's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures,
p286
aVthis one from jellyfish and corals,
p287
aVto illuminate the living brain and see its connections.
p288
aVIt's funny that we're using RGB
p289
aVjust to kind of satisfy our own human intuition,
p290
aVso we can see our brains better.
p291
aVAnd even more mind-blowing,
p292
aVis my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale,
p293
aVwho has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein
p294
aVthat responds to voltage.
p295
aVSo he could see when a single neuron fires.
p296
aVYou're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness
p297
aVthat was designed by marine creatures.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo this brings me all back to perspective and relationship.
p300
aVFrom deep space,
p301
aVour universe looks like a human brain cell,
p302
aVand then here we are in the deep ocean,
p303
aVand we're finding marine creatures and cells
p304
aVthat can illuminate the human mind.
p305
aVAnd it's my hope that with illuminated minds,
p306
aVwe could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life,
p307
aVand fathom how much more lies in store
p308
aVif we keep our oceans healthy.
p309
aa(lp310
VThank you.
