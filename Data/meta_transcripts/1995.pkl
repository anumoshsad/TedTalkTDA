VI study ants
p4
aVin the desert, in the tropical forest
p5
aVand in my kitchen,
p6
aVand in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.
p7
aVI've recently realized that ants
p8
aVare using interactions differently
p9
aVin different environments,
p10
aVand that got me thinking that we could learn from this
p11
aVabout other systems,
p12
aVlike brains and data networks that we engineer,
p13
aVand even cancer.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo what all these systems have in common
p16
aVis that there's no central control.
p17
aVAn ant colony consists of sterile female workers \u2014
p18
aVthose are the ants you see walking around \u2014
p19
aVand then one or more reproductive females
p20
aVwho just lay the eggs.
p21
aVThey don't give any instructions.
p22
aVEven though they're called queens,
p23
aVthey don't tell anybody what to do.
p24
aVSo in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,
p25
aVand all systems like this without central control
p26
aVare regulated using very simple interactions.
p27
aVAnts interact using smell.
p28
aVThey smell with their antennae,
p29
aVand they interact with their antennae,
p30
aVso when one ant touches another with its antennae,
p31
aVit can tell, for example, if the other ant
p32
aVis a nestmate
p33
aVand what task that other ant has been doing.
p34
aVSo here you see a lot of ants moving around
p35
aVand interacting in a lab arena
p36
aVthat's connected by tubes to two other arenas.
p37
aVSo when one ant meets another,
p38
aVit doesn't matter which ant it meets,
p39
aVand they're actually not transmitting
p40
aVany kind of complicated signal or message.
p41
aVAll that matters to the ant is the rate
p42
aVat which it meets other ants.
p43
aVAnd all of these interactions, taken together,
p44
aVproduce a network.
p45
aVSo this is the network of the ants
p46
aVthat you just saw moving around in the arena,
p47
aVand it's this constantly shifting network
p48
aVthat produces the behavior of the colony,
p49
aVlike whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,
p50
aVor how many are going out to forage.
p51
aVA brain actually works in the same way,
p52
aVbut what's great about ants is
p53
aVthat you can see the whole network as it happens.
p54
aa(lp55
VThere are more than 12,000 species of ants,
p56
aVin every conceivable environment,
p57
aVand they're using interactions differently
p58
aVto meet different environmental challenges.
p59
aVSo one important environmental challenge
p60
aVthat every system has to deal with
p61
aVis operating costs, just what it takes
p62
aVto run the system.
p63
aVAnd another environmental challenge is resources,
p64
aVfinding them and collecting them.
p65
aVIn the desert, operating costs are high
p66
aVbecause water is scarce,
p67
aVand the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert
p68
aVhave to spend water to get water.
p69
aVSo an ant outside foraging,
p70
aVsearching for seeds in the hot sun,
p71
aVjust loses water into the air.
p72
aVBut the colony gets its water
p73
aVby metabolizing the fats out of the seeds
p74
aVthat they eat.
p75
aVSo in this environment, interactions are used
p76
aVto activate foraging.
p77
aVAn outgoing forager doesn't go out unless
p78
aVit gets enough interactions with returning foragers,
p79
aVand what you see are the returning foragers
p80
aVgoing into the tunnel, into the nest,
p81
aVand meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
p82
aVThis makes sense for the ant colony,
p83
aVbecause the more food there is out there,
p84
aVthe more quickly the foragers find it,
p85
aVthe faster they come back,
p86
aVand the more foragers they send out.
p87
aVThe system works to stay stopped,
p88
aVunless something positive happens.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo interactions function to activate foragers.
p91
aVAnd we've been studying the evolution of this system.
p92
aVFirst of all, there's variation.
p93
aVIt turns out that colonies are different.
p94
aVOn dry days, some colonies forage less,
p95
aVso colonies are different in how
p96
aVthey manage this trade-off
p97
aVbetween spending water to search for seeds
p98
aVand getting water back in the form of seeds.
p99
aVAnd we're trying to understand why
p100
aVsome colonies forage less than others
p101
aVby thinking about ants as neurons,
p102
aVusing models from neuroscience.
p103
aVSo just as a neuron adds up its stimulation
p104
aVfrom other neurons to decide whether to fire,
p105
aVan ant adds up its stimulation from other ants
p106
aVto decide whether to forage.
p107
aVAnd what we're looking for is whether there might be
p108
aVsmall differences among colonies
p109
aVin how many interactions each ant needs
p110
aVbefore it's willing to go out and forage,
p111
aVbecause a colony like that would forage less.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd this raises an analogous question about brains.
p114
aVWe talk about the brain,
p115
aVbut of course every brain is slightly different,
p116
aVand maybe there are some individuals
p117
aVor some conditions
p118
aVin which the electrical properties of neurons are such
p119
aVthat they require more stimulus to fire,
p120
aVand that would lead to differences in brain function.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo in order to ask evolutionary questions,
p123
aVwe need to know about reproductive success.
p124
aVThis is a map of the study site
p125
aVwhere I have been tracking this population
p126
aVof harvester ant colonies for 28 years,
p127
aVwhich is about as long as a colony lives.
p128
aVEach symbol is a colony,
p129
aVand the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had,
p130
aVbecause we were able to use genetic variation
p131
aVto match up parent and offspring colonies,
p132
aVthat is, to figure out which colonies
p133
aVwere founded by a daughter queen
p134
aVproduced by which parent colony.
p135
aVAnd this was amazing for me, after all these years,
p136
aVto find out, for example, that colony 154,
p137
aVwhom I've known well for many years,
p138
aVis a great-grandmother.
p139
aVHere's her daughter colony,
p140
aVhere's her granddaughter colony,
p141
aVand these are her great-granddaughter colonies.
p142
aVAnd by doing this, I was able to learn
p143
aVthat offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
p144
aVin their decisions about which days are so hot
p145
aVthat they don't forage,
p146
aVand the offspring of parent colonies
p147
aVlive so far from each other that the ants never meet,
p148
aVso the ants of the offspring colony
p149
aVcan't be learning this from the parent colony.
p150
aVAnd so our next step is to look
p151
aVfor the genetic variation underlying this resemblance.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?
p154
aVOver the time of the study,
p155
aVand especially in the past 10 years,
p156
aVthere's been a very severe and deepening drought
p157
aVin the Southwestern U.S.,
p158
aVand it turns out that the colonies that conserve water,
p159
aVthat stay in when it's really hot outside,
p160
aVand thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,
p161
aVare the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.
p162
aVSo all this time, I thought that colony 154
p163
aVwas a loser, because on really dry days,
p164
aVthere'd be just this trickle of foraging,
p165
aVwhile the other colonies were out
p166
aVforaging, getting lots of food,
p167
aVbut in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.
p168
aVShe's a matriarch.
p169
aVShe's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.
p170
aVTo my knowledge, this is the first time
p171
aVthat we've been able to track
p172
aVthe ongoing evolution of collective behavior
p173
aVin a natural population of animals
p174
aVand find out what's actually working best.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow, the Internet uses an algorithm
p177
aVto regulate the flow of data
p178
aVthat's very similar to the one
p179
aVthat the harvester ants are using to regulate
p180
aVthe flow of foragers.
p181
aVAnd guess what we call this analogy?
p182
aVThe anternet is coming.
p183
aV(Applause)
p184
aVSo data doesn't leave the source computer
p185
aVunless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth
p186
aVfor it to travel on.
p187
aVIn the early days of the Internet,
p188
aVwhen operating costs were really high
p189
aVand it was really important not to lose any data,
p190
aVthen the system was set up for interactions
p191
aVto activate the flow of data.
p192
aVIt's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm
p193
aVthat's so similar to the one that we recently invented,
p194
aVbut this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms
p195
aVthat we know about,
p196
aVand ants have had 130 million years
p197
aVto evolve a lot of good ones,
p198
aVand I think it's very likely
p199
aVthat some of the other 12,000 species
p200
aVare going to have interesting algorithms
p201
aVfor data networks
p202
aVthat we haven't even thought of yet.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo what happens when operating costs are low?
p205
aVOperating costs are low in the tropics,
p206
aVbecause it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants
p207
aVto be outside walking around.
p208
aVBut the ants are so abundant
p209
aVand diverse in the tropics
p210
aVthat there's a lot of competition.
p211
aVWhatever resource one species is using,
p212
aVanother species is likely to be using that
p213
aVat the same time.
p214
aVSo in this environment, interactions are used
p215
aVin the opposite way.
p216
aVThe system keeps going
p217
aVunless something negative happens,
p218
aVand one species that I study makes circuits
p219
aVin the trees of foraging ants
p220
aVgoing from the nest to a food source and back,
p221
aVjust round and round,
p222
aVunless something negative happens,
p223
aVlike an interaction
p224
aVwith ants of another species.
p225
aVSo here's an example of ant security.
p226
aVIn the middle, there's an ant
p227
aVplugging the nest entrance with its head
p228
aVin response to interactions with another species.
p229
aVThose are the little ones running around
p230
aVwith their abdomens up in the air.
p231
aVBut as soon as the threat is passed,
p232
aVthe entrance is open again,
p233
aVand maybe there are situations
p234
aVin computer security
p235
aVwhere operating costs are low enough
p236
aVthat we could just block access temporarily
p237
aVin response to an immediate threat,
p238
aVand then open it again,
p239
aVinstead of trying to build
p240
aVa permanent firewall or fortress.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo another environmental challenge
p243
aVthat all systems have to deal with
p244
aVis resources, finding and collecting them.
p245
aVAnd to do this, ants solve the problem
p246
aVof collective search,
p247
aVand this is a problem that's of great interest
p248
aVright now in robotics,
p249
aVbecause we've understood that,
p250
aVrather than sending a single,
p251
aVsophisticated, expensive robot out
p252
aVto explore another planet
p253
aVor to search a burning building,
p254
aVthat instead, it may be more effective
p255
aVto get a group of cheaper robots
p256
aVexchanging only minimal information,
p257
aVand that's the way that ants do it.
p258
aVSo the invasive Argentine ant
p259
aVmakes expandable search networks.
p260
aVThey're good at dealing with the main problem
p261
aVof collective search,
p262
aVwhich is the trade-off between
p263
aVsearching very thoroughly
p264
aVand covering a lot of ground.
p265
aVAnd what they do is,
p266
aVwhen there are many ants in a small space,
p267
aVthen each one can search very thoroughly
p268
aVbecause there will be another ant nearby
p269
aVsearching over there,
p270
aVbut when there are a few ants
p271
aVin a large space,
p272
aVthen they need to stretch out their paths
p273
aVto cover more ground.
p274
aVI think they use interactions to assess density,
p275
aVso when they're really crowded,
p276
aVthey meet more often,
p277
aVand they search more thoroughly.
p278
aVDifferent ant species must use different algorithms,
p279
aVbecause they've evolved to deal with
p280
aVdifferent resources,
p281
aVand it could be really useful to know about this,
p282
aVand so we recently asked ants
p283
aVto solve the collective search problem
p284
aVin the extreme environment
p285
aVof microgravity
p286
aVin the International Space Station.
p287
aVWhen I first saw this picture, I thought,
p288
aVOh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,
p289
aVbut then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.
p290
aVSo the idea here is that the ants
p291
aVare working so hard to hang on
p292
aVto the wall or the floor or whatever you call it
p293
aVthat they're less likely to interact,
p294
aVand so the relationship between
p295
aVhow crowded they are and how often they meet
p296
aVwould be messed up.
p297
aVWe're still analyzing the data.
p298
aVI don't have the results yet.
p299
aVBut it would be interesting to know
p300
aVhow other species solve this problem
p301
aVin different environments on Earth,
p302
aVand so we're setting up a program
p303
aVto encourage kids around the world
p304
aVto try this experiment with different species.
p305
aVIt's very simple.
p306
aVIt can be done with cheap materials.
p307
aVAnd that way, we could make a global map
p308
aVof ant collective search algorithms.
p309
aVAnd I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,
p310
aVthe ones that come into our buildings,
p311
aVare going to be really good at this,
p312
aVbecause they're in your kitchen
p313
aVbecause they're really good at finding food and water.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo the most familiar resource for ants
p316
aVis a picnic,
p317
aVand this is a clustered resource.
p318
aVWhen there's one piece of fruit,
p319
aVthere's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,
p320
aVand the ants that specialize on clustered resources
p321
aVuse interactions for recruitment.
p322
aVSo when one ant meets another,
p323
aVor when it meets a chemical deposited
p324
aVon the ground by another,
p325
aVthen it changes direction to follow
p326
aVin the direction of the interaction,
p327
aVand that's how you get the trail of ants
p328
aVsharing your picnic.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow this is a place where I think we might be able
p331
aVto learn something from ants about cancer.
p332
aVI mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot
p333
aVto prevent cancer
p334
aVby not allowing people to spread around
p335
aVor sell the toxins that promote
p336
aVthe evolution of cancer in our bodies,
p337
aVbut I don't think the ants can help us much with this
p338
aVbecause ants never poison their own colonies.
p339
aVBut we might be able to learn something from ants
p340
aVabout treating cancer.
p341
aVThere are many different kinds of cancer.
p342
aVEach one originates in a particular part of the body,
p343
aVand then some kinds of cancer will spread
p344
aVor metastasize to particular other tissues
p345
aVwhere they must be getting resources that they need.
p346
aVSo if you think from the perspective
p347
aVof early metastatic cancer cells
p348
aVas they're out searching around
p349
aVfor the resources that they need,
p350
aVif those resources are clustered,
p351
aVthey're likely to use interactions for recruitment,
p352
aVand if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting,
p353
aVthen maybe we could set traps
p354
aVto catch them before they become established.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo ants are using interactions in different ways
p357
aVin a huge variety of environments,
p358
aVand we could learn from this
p359
aVabout other systems that operate
p360
aVwithout central control.
p361
aVUsing only simple interactions,
p362
aVant colonies have been performing
p363
aVamazing feats for more than 130 million years.
p364
aVWe have a lot to learn from them.
