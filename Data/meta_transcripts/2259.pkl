VSo I grew up in Orlando, Florida.
p4
aVI was the son of an aerospace engineer.
p5
aVI lived and breathed the Apollo program.
p6
aVWe either saw the launches from our backyard
p7
aVor we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape.
p8
aVI was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it,
p9
aVbut I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.
p10
aa(lp11
VBehind me you see an amazing view,
p12
aVa picture that was taken from the International Space Station,
p13
aVand it shows a portion of our planet
p14
aVthat's rarely seen and rarely studied
p15
aVand almost never explored.
p16
aVThat place is called the stratosphere.
p17
aa(lp18
VIf you start on the planet and you go up and up and up,
p19
aVit gets colder and colder and colder,
p20
aVuntil you reach the beginning of the stratosphere,
p21
aVand then an amazing thing happens.
p22
aVIt gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up,
p23
aVand then it gets warmer and warmer
p24
aVuntil the point where you can almost survive without any protection,
p25
aVabout zero degrees,
p26
aVand then you end up getting colder and colder,
p27
aVand that's the top of the stratosphere.
p28
aVIt is one of the least accessible places on our planet.
p29
aVMost often, when it's visited,
p30
aVit's by astronauts who are blazing up at it
p31
aVat probably several times the speed of sound,
p32
aVand they get a few seconds on the way up,
p33
aVand then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in,
p34
aVon the way back in.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere?
p37
aVIs it possible to experience the stratosphere?
p38
aVIs it possible to explore the stratosphere?
p39
aa(lp40
VI studied this using my favorite search engine
p41
aVfor quite a while, about a year,
p42
aVand then I made a scary phone call.
p43
aVIt was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum
p44
aVfrom Paragon Space Development Corporation,
p45
aVand I asked him the question:
p46
aVis it possible to build
p47
aVa system to go into the stratosphere?
p48
aVAnd he said it was.
p49
aVAnd after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that.
p50
aVAnd on October 24 of last year,
p51
aVin this suit,
p52
aVI started on the ground,
p53
aVI went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet \u2014
p54
aVbut who's counting?
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VCame back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.
p59
aVIt was a four-minute and 27-second descent.
p60
aVAnd when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Applause)
p63
aa(lp64
VBut this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk,
p65
aVand what was amazing to me about that experience
p66
aVis that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit,
p67
aVand more than that, come down tomorrow
p68
aVand let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group
p69
aVthat actually built it.
p70
aVAnd they did something which I think is important,
p71
aVwhich is they took the analogy of scuba diving.
p72
aVSo in scuba diving,
p73
aVyou have a self-contained system.
p74
aVYou have everything that you could ever need.
p75
aVYou have a scuba tank.
p76
aVYou have a wetsuit.
p77
aVYou have visibility.
p78
aVAnd that scuba is exactly this system,
p79
aVand we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.
p80
aa(lp81
VThree years later, this is what we have.
p82
aVWe've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover.
p83
aVILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits
p84
aVand all of the extravehicular activity suits.
p85
aVThey had never sold a suit commercially,
p86
aVonly to the government,
p87
aVbut they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for.
p88
aVUp here we have a parachute. This was all about safety.
p89
aVEveryone on the team knew
p90
aVthat I have a wife and two small children \u2014
p91
aV10 and 15 \u2014
p92
aVand I wanted to come back safely.
p93
aVSo there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute,
p94
aVand if I do nothing,
p95
aVthe reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device.
p96
aVThe suit itself can protect me from the cold.
p97
aVThis area in the front here has thermal protection.
p98
aVIt will actually heat water that will wrap around my body.
p99
aVIt has two redundant oxygen tanks.
p100
aVEven if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit,
p101
aVwhich is extremely unlikely,
p102
aVthis system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe main advantage of this system is weight and complexity.
p105
aVSo the system weighs about 500 pounds,
p106
aVand if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere,
p107
aVthey used a capsule.
p108
aVAnd to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it,
p109
aVand it weighed about 3,000 pounds,
p110
aVand to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet,
p111
aVwhich was my target altitude,
p112
aVit would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.
p113
aVBecause I only weighed 500 pounds in this system,
p114
aVwe could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that,
p115
aVand that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
p116
aVthan what needs to be done for a much larger balloon.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.
p119
aVWe had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night.
p120
aVAnd here's the suit.
p121
aVAgain, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second,
p122
aVand I want to play you a video of the actual launch.
p123
aVRoswell's a great place to launch balloons,
p124
aVbut it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute,
p125
aVespecially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started.
p126
aVThat's a helium truck in the background.
p127
aVIt's darkness.
p128
aVI've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing.
p129
aVAnd then here you see the suit going on.
p130
aVIt takes about an hour to get the suit on.
p131
aVAstronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van
p132
aVto go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VYou can see the top. You can see the balloon up there.
p137
aVThat's where the helium is.
p138
aVThis is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles.
p139
aVAnd there we go.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VThat's me waving with my left hand.
p144
aVThe reason I'm waving with my left hand
p145
aVis because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VMy team forbade me from using my right hand.
p150
aVSo the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VIt took two hours and seven minutes to go up,
p155
aVand it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes.
p156
aVI was mostly trying to relax.
p157
aVMy heart rate was very low
p158
aVand I was trying not to use very much oxygen.
p159
aVYou can see how the fields in the background
p160
aVare relatively big at this point,
p161
aVand you can see me going up and up.
p162
aa(lp163
VIt's interesting here, because if you look,
p164
aVI'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,
p165
aVbut immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind
p166
aVof over 120 miles an hour.
p167
aVThis is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher
p168
aVthan anybody else had ever gone in a balloon,
p169
aVand I was about 4,000 feet from release.
p170
aVThis is what it looks like.
p171
aVYou can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth,
p172
aVthe fragile planet below.
p173
aVI'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now.
p174
aVIf anything goes wrong, I want to be ready.
p175
aVAnd the main thing that I want to do here
p176
aVis to have a release and fall and stay completely stable.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?
p179
aVFive. Four. Three. Two. One.
p180
aa(lp181
VAlan Eustace: There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point.
p182
aVAnd there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second,
p183
aVbecause that's really important.
p184
aVThere's the balloon going by a second time.
p185
aVRight now, I'm about at the speed of sound.
p186
aVThere's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound,
p187
aVand very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get,
p188
aV822 miles an hour.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.
p191
aa(lp192
VAE: So now I'm down low right now
p193
aVand you can basically see the parachute come out right there.
p194
aVAt this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out.
p195
aVI thought I was the only one happy,
p196
aVbut it turns out mission control was really happy as well.
p197
aVThe really nice thing about this is the moment I opened \u2014
p198
aVI had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy.
p199
aVHe flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out
p200
aVand landed right next to me.
p201
aVHe was my wingman on the descent.
p202
aVThis is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VI hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
V(Video) Man: How are you doing?
p213
aa(lp214
VAE: Hi there!
p215
aVYay.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo I want to tell you one thing
p220
aVthat you might not have seen in that video,
p221
aVbut one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release
p222
aVand what happens right after you release.
p223
aVAnd what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute,
p224
aVand a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me.
p225
aVAnd I'll show you one of those right now.
p226
aVIf any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving,
p227
aVyou probably used one of these.
p228
aVBut the problem with one of these things
p229
aVis right when you release, you're in zero gravity.
p230
aVSo it's very easy for this to just turn right around you.
p231
aVAnd before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning,
p232
aVor you can release this drogue late,
p233
aVin which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,
p234
aVand this thing is going to destroy itself
p235
aVand not be very useful.
p236
aVBut the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea,
p237
aVand it was a roll that looks like that,
p238
aVbut watch what happens when I pull it out.
p239
aVIt's forming a pipe.
p240
aVThis pipe is so solid
p241
aVthat you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around,
p242
aVand there's no way it will ever tangle with you.
p243
aVAnd that prevented a very serious potential problem.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo nothing is possible without an amazing team of people.
p246
aVThe core of this was about 20 people
p247
aVthat worked on this for the three years,
p248
aVand they were incredible.
p249
aVPeople asked me what the best part of this whole thing was,
p250
aVand it was a chance to work with the best experts
p251
aVin meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology
p252
aVand environmental systems and high altitude medicine.
p253
aVIt was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people.
p254
aVAnd I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google,
p255
aVboth for supporting me during this effort
p256
aVand also covering for me in the times that I was away.
p257
aVBut there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family.
p258
aVYay.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VI would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology,
p263
aVand they weren't hearing any of it.
p264
aVIt was super hard on them,
p265
aVand the only reason that my wife put up with it
p266
aVwas because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests,
p267
aVand she didn't want to take that away from me.
p268
aVSo I want to close with a story.
p269
aVMy daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car,
p270
aVand we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there,
p271
aVand she had this idea, and she goes, "Dad, I've got this idea."
p272
aVAnd so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."
p273
aVAnd she looks at me
p274
aVand she goes, "Dad, after what you just did,
p275
aVhow can you call anything impossible?"
p276
aVAnd I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible,
p277
aVit's just very, very hard."
p278
aVAnd then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn,
p279
aVit may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard,
p280
aVit's just that I don't know how to do it."
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Applause)
