VA human child is born,
p4
aVand for quite a long time
p5
aVis a consumer.
p6
aVIt cannot be consciously a contributor.
p7
aVIt is helpless.
p8
aVIt doesn't know how to survive,
p9
aVeven though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
p10
aVIt needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
p11
aVIt can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
p12
aVIt has to totally surrender,
p13
aVas one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
p14
aa(lp15
VIt has to totally surrender.
p16
aVThat implies a lot of trust.
p17
aVThat implies the trusted person
p18
aVwon't violate the trust.
p19
aVAs the child grows,
p20
aVit begins to discover
p21
aVthat the person trusted is violating the trust.
p22
aVIt doesn't know even the word "violation."
p23
aVTherefore, it has to blame itself,
p24
aVa wordless blame,
p25
aVwhich is more difficult to really resolve \u2014
p26
aVthe wordless self-blame.
p27
aa(lp28
VAs the child grows to become an adult:
p29
aVso far, it has been a consumer,
p30
aVbut the growth of a human being
p31
aVlies in his or her capacity to contribute,
p32
aVto be a contributor.
p33
aVOne cannot contribute unless one feels secure,
p34
aVone feels big,
p35
aVone feels: I have enough.
p36
aa(lp37
VTo be compassionate is not a joke.
p38
aVIt's not that simple.
p39
aVOne has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
p40
aVThat bigness should be centered on oneself,
p41
aVnot in terms of money,
p42
aVnot in terms of power you wield,
p43
aVnot in terms of any status that you can command in the society,
p44
aVbut it should be centered on oneself.
p45
aVThe self: you are self-aware.
p46
aVOn that self, it should be centered \u2014 a bigness, a wholeness.
p47
aVOtherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
p48
aa(lp49
VYou can be compassionate occasionally,
p50
aVmore moved by empathy
p51
aVthan by compassion.
p52
aVThank God we are empathetic.
p53
aVWhen somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
p54
aa(lp55
VIn a Wimbledon final match,
p56
aVthese two guys fight it out.
p57
aVEach one has got two games.
p58
aVIt can be anybody's game.
p59
aVWhat they have sweated so far has no meaning.
p60
aVOne person wins.
p61
aVThe tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net
p62
aVand shake hands.
p63
aVThe winner boxes the air
p64
aVand kisses the ground,
p65
aVthrows his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVAnd this guy has to come to the net.
p68
aVWhen he comes to the net,
p69
aVyou see, his whole face changes.
p70
aVIt looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
p71
aVWhy? Empathy.
p72
aa(lp73
VThat's human heart.
p74
aVNo human heart is denied of that empathy.
p75
aVNo religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
p76
aVNo culture, no nation and nationalism \u2014
p77
aVnothing can touch it
p78
aVbecause it is empathy.
p79
aVAnd that capacity to empathize
p80
aVis the window through which you reach out to people,
p81
aVyou do something that makes a difference in somebody's life \u2014
p82
aVeven words, even time.
p83
aa(lp84
VCompassion is not defined in one form.
p85
aVThere's no Indian compassion.
p86
aVThere's no American compassion.
p87
aVIt transcends nation, the gender, the age.
p88
aVWhy? Because it is there in everybody.
p89
aVIt's experienced by people occasionally.
p90
aa(lp91
VThen this occasional compassion,
p92
aVwe are not talking about \u2014
p93
aVit will never remain occasional.
p94
aVBy mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
p95
aVYou can't say, "Please love me."
p96
aVLove is something you discover.
p97
aVIt's not an action,
p98
aVbut in the English language, it is also an action.
p99
aVI will come to it later.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
p102
aVI am going to cite the possibility of being whole,
p103
aVwhich is within our experience, everybody's experience.
p104
aVIn spite of a very tragic life,
p105
aVone is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
p106
aVAnd the one who is happy,
p107
aVeven for a slapstick joke,
p108
aVaccepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
p109
aa(lp110
VThat means the whole universe,
p111
aVknown things and unknown things.
p112
aVAll of them are totally accepted
p113
aVbecause you discover your wholeness in yourself.
p114
aVThe subject \u2014 "me" \u2014
p115
aVand the object \u2014 the scheme of things \u2014
p116
aVfuse into oneness,
p117
aVan experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"
p118
aVan experience common to all and sundry.
p119
aa(lp120
VThat experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations \u2014
p121
aVall your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards
p122
aVand layoffs
p123
aVand, finally, baldness \u2014
p124
aVyou can be happy.
p125
aVBut the extension of the logic is
p126
aVthat you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
p127
aVYou are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere's no choice in this:
p130
aVthat only confirms the reality
p131
aVthat the wholeness cannot be different from you,
p132
aVcannot be minus you.
p133
aVIt has got to be you.
p134
aVYou cannot be a part of wholeness
p135
aVand still be whole.
p136
aVYour moment of happiness reveals that reality,
p137
aVthat realization, that recognition:
p138
aV"Maybe I am the whole.
p139
aVMaybe the swami is right.
p140
aa(lp141
VMaybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
p142
aVThen everything becomes meaningful.
p143
aVI have no more reason to blame myself.
p144
aVIf one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
p145
aVBut if I say, in spite of my body being limited \u2014
p146
aVif it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:
p147
aVbody is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
p148
aa(lp149
VYour knowledge is limited, health is limited,
p150
aVand power is therefore limited,
p151
aVand the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
p152
aVCompassion is going to be limited.
p153
aVEverything is going to be limitless.
p154
aVYou cannot command compassion
p155
aVunless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,
p156
aVeither you are or you are not. Period.
p157
aVAnd there is no way of your being not limitless too.
p158
aa(lp159
VYour own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
p160
aVAnd the wholeness is the reality of you
p161
aVwhen you relate to the world.
p162
aVIt is love first.
p163
aVWhen you relate to the world,
p164
aVthe dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
p165
aVis, what we say, love.
p166
aVAnd itself becomes compassion
p167
aVif the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
p168
aVThen that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
p169
aVYou express yourself because you have compassion.
p170
aa(lp171
VTo discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
p172
aVTo discover the capacity to give and share,
p173
aVyou need to be giving and sharing.
p174
aVThere is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
p175
aVYou learn swimming by swimming.
p176
aVYou cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aVYou learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
p179
aVYou learn cooking by cooking,
p180
aVhaving some sympathetic people around you
p181
aVto eat what you cook.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd, therefore, what I say,
p185
aVyou have to fake it and make it.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVYou need to.
p188
aVMy predecessor meant that.
p189
aVYou have to act it out.
p190
aVYou have to act compassionately.
p191
aa(lp192
VThere is no verb for compassion,
p193
aVbut you have an adverb for compassion.
p194
aVThat's interesting to me.
p195
aVYou act compassionately.
p196
aVBut then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
p197
aVThat is where you fake.
p198
aVYou fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VYou fake it and make it.
p202
aVYou act compassionately as though you have compassion:
p203
aVgrind your teeth,
p204
aVtake all the support system.
p205
aVIf you know how to pray, pray.
p206
aVAsk for compassion.
p207
aVLet me act compassionately.
p208
aVDo it.
p209
aVYou'll discover compassion
p210
aVand also slowly a relative compassion,
p211
aVand slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,
p212
aVyou'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation
p213
aVof the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,
p214
aVand that's what you are.
p215
aa(lp216
VWith these words, thank you very much.
