VSo today, I'm going to tell you about some people
p4
aVwho didn't move out of their neighborhoods.
p5
aVThe first one is happening right here in Chicago.
p6
aVBrenda Palms-Farber was hired
p7
aVto help ex-convicts reenter society
p8
aVand keep them from going back into prison.
p9
aVCurrently, taxpayers spend
p10
aVabout 60,000 dollars per year
p11
aVsending a person to jail.
p12
aVWe know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
p13
aVI find it interesting that, for every one dollar
p14
aVwe spend, however, on early childhood education,
p15
aVlike Head Start,
p16
aVwe save 17 dollars
p17
aVon stuff like incarceration in the future.
p18
aVOr \u2014 think about it \u2014 that 60,000 dollars
p19
aVis more than what it costs
p20
aVto send one person to Harvard as well.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,
p23
aVtook a look at her challenge
p24
aVand came up
p25
aVwith a not-so-obvious solution:
p26
aVcreate a business
p27
aVthat produces skin care products from honey.
p28
aVOkay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.
p29
aVIt's the basis of growing a form of social innovation
p30
aVthat has real potential.
p31
aVShe hired seemingly unemployable men and women
p32
aVto care for the bees, harvest the honey
p33
aVand make value-added products
p34
aVthat they marketed themselves,
p35
aVand that were later sold at Whole Foods.
p36
aVShe combined employment experience and training
p37
aVwith life skills they needed,
p38
aVlike anger-management and teamwork,
p39
aVand also how to talk to future employers
p40
aVabout how their experiences
p41
aVactually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned
p42
aVand their eagerness to learn more.
p43
aVLess than four percent
p44
aVof the folks that went through her program
p45
aVactually go back to jail.
p46
aVSo these young men and women learned job-readiness
p47
aVand life skills through bee keeping
p48
aVand became productive citizens in the process.
p49
aVTalk about a sweet beginning.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,
p52
aVand lots of people know
p53
aVthat L.A. has its issues.
p54
aVBut I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.
p55
aVThey have not enough water on most days
p56
aVand too much to handle when it rains.
p57
aVCurrently, 20 percent
p58
aVof California's energy consumption
p59
aVis used to pump water
p60
aVinto mostly Southern California.
p61
aVTheir spending loads, loads,
p62
aVto channel that rainwater out into the ocean
p63
aVwhen it rains and floods as well.
p64
aVNow Andy Lipkis is working to help
p65
aVL.A. cut infrastructure costs
p66
aVassociated with water management and urban heat island \u2014
p67
aVlinking trees, people and technology
p68
aVto create a more livable city.
p69
aVAll that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,
p70
aValso helps cool our cities.
p71
aVBecause, come to think about it,
p72
aVdo you really want air-conditioning,
p73
aVor is it a cooler room that you want?
p74
aVHow you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo a few years ago,
p77
aVL.A. County
p78
aVdecided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars
p79
aVto repair the city schools.
p80
aVAnd Andy and his team discovered
p81
aVthat they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars
p82
aVon asphalt to surround the schools themselves.
p83
aVAnd by presenting a really strong economic case,
p84
aVthey convinced the L.A. government
p85
aVthat replacing that asphalt
p86
aVwith trees and other greenery,
p87
aVthat the schools themselves would save the system more on energy
p88
aVthan they spend on horticultural infrastructure.
p89
aVSo ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt
p90
aVwas replaced or avoided,
p91
aVand electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,
p92
aVwhile employment
p93
aVfor people to maintain those grounds went up,
p94
aVresulting in a net-savings to the system,
p95
aVbut also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow Judy Bonds
p98
aVis a coal miner's daughter.
p99
aVHer family has eight generations
p100
aVin a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.
p101
aVAnd if anyone should be clinging
p102
aVto the former glory of the coal mining history,
p103
aVand of the town,
p104
aVit should be Judy.
p105
aVBut the way coal is mined right now is different
p106
aVfrom the deep mines that her father
p107
aVand her father's father would go down into
p108
aVand that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
p109
aVNow, two dozen men
p110
aVcan tear down a mountain in several months,
p111
aVand only for about a few years' worth of coal.
p112
aVThat kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."
p113
aVIt can make a mountain go from this to this
p114
aVin a few short months.
p115
aVJust imagine that the air surrounding these places \u2014
p116
aVit's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
p117
aVWhen we visited, it gave some of the people we were with
p118
aVthis strange little cough
p119
aVafter being only there for just a few hours or so \u2014
p120
aVnot just miners, but everybody.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd Judy saw her landscape being destroyed
p123
aVand her water poisoned.
p124
aVAnd the coal companies just move on
p125
aVafter the mountain was emptied,
p126
aVleaving even more unemployment in their wake.
p127
aVBut she also saw the difference in potential wind energy
p128
aVon an intact mountain,
p129
aVand one that was reduced in elevation
p130
aVby over 2,000 feet.
p131
aVThree years of dirty energy with not many jobs,
p132
aVor centuries of clean energy
p133
aVwith the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency
p134
aVbased on technical skills,
p135
aVand developing local knowledge
p136
aVabout how to get the most out of that region's wind.
p137
aVShe calculated the up-front cost
p138
aVand the payback over time,
p139
aVand it's a net-plus on so many levels
p140
aVfor the local, national and global economy.
p141
aVIt's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,
p142
aVbut the wind energy actually pays back forever.
p143
aVNow mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,
p144
aVand it gives them a lot of misery.
p145
aVThe water is turned into goo.
p146
aVMost people are still unemployed,
p147
aVleading to most of the same kinds of social problems
p148
aVthat unemployed people in inner cities also experience \u2014
p149
aVdrug and alcohol abuse,
p150
aVdomestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.
p151
aa(lp152
VNow Judy and I \u2014 I have to say \u2014
p153
aVtotally related to each other.
p154
aVNot quite an obvious alliance.
p155
aVI mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.
p156
aVI mean, they are not \u2014
p157
aVthey ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title
p158
aVor anything like that.
p159
aVBut the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,
p160
aVsays, "Save the endangered hillbillies."
p161
aVSo homegirls and hillbillies we got it together
p162
aVand totally understand that this is what it's all about.
p163
aVBut just a few months ago,
p164
aVJudy was diagnosed
p165
aVwith stage-three lung cancer.
p166
aVYeah.
p167
aVAnd it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
p168
aVAnd I just find it so bizarre
p169
aVthat she's suffering from the same thing
p170
aVthat she tried so hard to protect people from.
p171
aVBut her dream
p172
aVof Coal River Mountain Wind
p173
aVis her legacy.
p174
aVAnd she might not
p175
aVget to see that mountaintop.
p176
aVBut rather than writing
p177
aVyet some kind of manifesto or something,
p178
aVshe's leaving behind
p179
aVa business plan to make it happen.
p180
aVThat's what my homegirl is doing.
p181
aVSo I'm so proud of that.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VBut these three people
p186
aVdon't know each other,
p187
aVbut they do have an awful lot in common.
p188
aVThey're all problem solvers,
p189
aVand they're just some of the many examples
p190
aVthat I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from
p191
aVin the examples of the work that I do now.
p192
aVI was really lucky to have them all featured
p193
aVon my Corporation for Public Radio radio show
p194
aVcalled ThePromisedLand.org.
p195
aVNow they're all very practical visionaries.
p196
aVThey take a look at the demands that are out there \u2014
p197
aVbeauty products, healthy schools, electricity \u2014
p198
aVand how the money's flowing to meet those demands.
p199
aVAnd when the cheapest solutions
p200
aVinvolve reducing the number of jobs,
p201
aVyou're left with unemployed people,
p202
aVand those people aren't cheap.
p203
aVIn fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,
p204
aVand they include generationally impoverished,
p205
aVtraumatized vets returning from the Middle East,
p206
aVpeople coming out of jail.
p207
aVAnd for the veterans in particular,
p208
aVthe V.A. said there's a six-fold increase
p209
aVin mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.
p210
aVI think that number's probably going to go up.
p211
aVThey're not the largest number of people,
p212
aVbut they are some of the most expensive \u2014
p213
aVand in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,
p214
aVpoor performance by their kids in schools
p215
aVand also poor health as a result of stress.
p216
aVSo these three guys all understand
p217
aVhow to productively channel dollars
p218
aVthrough our local economies
p219
aVto meet existing market demands,
p220
aVreduce the social problems that we have now
p221
aVand prevent new problems in the future.
p222
aa(lp223
VAnd there are plenty of other examples like that.
p224
aVOne problem: waste handling and unemployment.
p225
aVEven when we think or talk about recycling,
p226
aVlots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills
p227
aVand leaving many municipalities, diversion rates \u2014
p228
aVthey leave much to be recycled.
p229
aVAnd where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.
p230
aVAnd we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models \u2014
p231
aVthere's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,
p232
aVwhere either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,
p233
aVor you use recycled materials
p234
aVto make goods that you can actually use and sell.
p235
aVWe can create these local markets and incentives
p236
aVfor recycled materials
p237
aVto be used as raw materials for manufacturing.
p238
aVAnd in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,
p239
aVbut our mayor decided what he wanted to see
p240
aVwas a jail on that same spot.
p241
aVFortunately \u2014 because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs \u2014
p242
aVbut after many years,
p243
aVthe city wanted to build a jail.
p244
aVThey've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnother problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.
p247
aVWorking-class and poor urban Americans
p248
aVare not benefiting economically
p249
aVfrom our current food system.
p250
aVIt relies too much on transportation,
p251
aVchemical fertilization, big use of water
p252
aVand also refrigeration.
p253
aVMega agricultural operations
p254
aVoften are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,
p255
aVand it produces this incredibly unhealthy product
p256
aVthat costs us billions in healthcare
p257
aVand lost productivity.
p258
aVAnd so we know "urban ag"
p259
aVis a big buzz topic this time of the year,
p260
aVbut it's mostly gardening,
p261
aVwhich has some value in community building \u2014 lots of it \u2014
p262
aVbut it's not in terms of creating jobs
p263
aVor for food production.
p264
aVThe numbers just aren't there.
p265
aVPart of my work now is really laying the groundwork
p266
aVto integrate urban ag and rural food systems
p267
aVto hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad
p268
aVby creating a national brand of urban-grown produce
p269
aVin every city,
p270
aVthat uses regional growing power
p271
aVand augments it with indoor growing facilities,
p272
aVowned and operated by small growers,
p273
aVwhere now there are only consumers.
p274
aVThis can support seasonal farmers around metro areas
p275
aVwho are losing out because they really can't meet
p276
aVthe year-round demand for produce.
p277
aVIt's not a competition with rural farm;
p278
aVit's actually reinforcements.
p279
aVIt allies in a really positive
p280
aVand economically viable food system.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands
p283
aVfor hospitals,
p284
aVsenior centers, schools, daycare centers,
p285
aVand produce a network of regional jobs, as well.
p286
aVThis is smart infrastructure.
p287
aVAnd how we manage our built environment
p288
aVaffects the health and well-being of people every single day.
p289
aVOur municipalities, rural and urban,
p290
aVplay the operational course of infrastructure \u2014
p291
aVthings like waste disposal, energy demand,
p292
aVas well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates
p293
aVand the impacts of various public health costs.
p294
aVSmart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways
p295
aVfor municipalities to handle
p296
aVboth infrastructure and social needs.
p297
aVAnd we want to shift the systems
p298
aVthat open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens
p299
aVto become part of the tax base.
p300
aVAnd imagine a national business model
p301
aVthat creates local jobs and smart infrastructure
p302
aVto improve local economic stability.
p303
aVSo I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
p304
aa(lp305
VThese examples indicate a trend.
p306
aVI haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
p307
aVI'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,
p308
aVand the good news is that it's growing.
p309
aVAnd we all need to be invested in it.
p310
aVIt is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
p311
aVAnd I call it "hometown security."
p312
aVThe recession has us reeling and fearful,
p313
aVand there's something in the air these days
p314
aVthat is also very empowering.
p315
aVIt's a realization
p316
aVthat we are the key
p317
aVto our own recovery.
p318
aVNow is the time for us to act in our own communities
p319
aVwhere we think local and we act local.
p320
aVAnd when we do that, our neighbors \u2014
p321
aVbe they next-door, or in the next state,
p322
aVor in the next country \u2014
p323
aVwill be just fine.
p324
aVThe sum of the local is the global.
p325
aVHometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,
p326
aVputting people to work,
p327
aVrestoring our natural systems.
p328
aVHometown security means creating wealth here at home,
p329
aVinstead of destroying it overseas.
p330
aVTackling social and environmental problems
p331
aVat the same time with the same solution
p332
aVyields great cost savings,
p333
aVwealth generation and national security.
p334
aVMany great and inspiring solutions
p335
aVhave been generated across America.
p336
aVThe challenge for us now
p337
aVis to identify and support countless more.
p338
aa(lp339
VNow, hometown security is about taking care of your own,
p340
aVbut it's not like the old saying,
p341
aV"charity begins at home."
p342
aVI recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.
p343
aVAnd it's about leading in a world
p344
aVthat really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
p345
aVAnd reading that book made me reexamine that theory
p346
aVbecause I need to explain what I mean by that.
p347
aVSee, my dad
p348
aVwas a great, great man in many ways.
p349
aVHe grew up in the segregated South,
p350
aVescaped lynching and all that
p351
aVduring some really hard times,
p352
aVand he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings
p353
aVand a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.
p354
aVBut, like all of us, he had some problems.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVAnd his was gambling,
p357
aVcompulsively.
p358
aVTo him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"
p359
aVmeant that my payday \u2014 or someone else's \u2014
p360
aVwould just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
p361
aVSo you need to help him out.
p362
aVAnd sometimes I would loan him money
p363
aVfrom my after-school or summer jobs,
p364
aVand he always had the great intention
p365
aVof paying me back with interest,
p366
aVof course, after he hit it big.
p367
aVAnd he did sometimes, believe it or not,
p368
aVat a racetrack in Los Angeles \u2014
p369
aVone reason to love L.A. \u2014 back in the 1940s.
p370
aVHe made 15,000 dollars cash
p371
aVand bought the house that I grew up in.
p372
aVSo I'm not that unhappy about that.
p373
aVBut listen, I did feel obligated to him,
p374
aVand I grew up \u2014 then I grew up.
p375
aVAnd I'm a grown woman now,
p376
aVand I have learned a few things along the way.
p377
aa(lp378
VTo me, charity
p379
aVoften is just about giving,
p380
aVbecause you're supposed to,
p381
aVor because it's what you've always done,
p382
aVor it's about giving until it hurts.
p383
aVI'm about providing the means
p384
aVto build something that will grow
p385
aVand intensify its original investment
p386
aVand not just require greater giving next year \u2014
p387
aVI'm not trying to feed the habit.
p388
aVI spent some years
p389
aVwatching how good intentions for community empowerment,
p390
aVthat were supposed to be there
p391
aVto support the community and empower it,
p392
aVactually left people
p393
aVin the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.
p394
aVAnd over the past 20 years,
p395
aVwe've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars
p396
aVon social problems,
p397
aVyet educational outcomes,
p398
aVmalnutrition, incarceration,
p399
aVobesity, diabetes, income disparity,
p400
aVthey've all gone up with some exceptions \u2014
p401
aVin particular, infant mortality
p402
aVamong people in poverty \u2014
p403
aVbut it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
p404
aa(lp405
VAnd I know a little bit about these issues,
p406
aVbecause, for many years, I spent a long time
p407
aVin the non-profit industrial complex,
p408
aVand I'm a recovering executive director,
p409
aVtwo years clean.
p410
aV(Laughter)
p411
aVBut during that time, I realized that it was about projects
p412
aVand developing them on the local level
p413
aVthat really was going to do the right thing for our communities.
p414
aVBut I really did struggle for financial support.
p415
aVThe greater our success,
p416
aVthe less money came in from foundations.
p417
aVAnd I tell you, being on the TED stage
p418
aVand winning a MacArthur in the same exact year
p419
aVgave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
p420
aVAnd by the time I'd moved on,
p421
aVI was actually covering a third
p422
aVof my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.
p423
aVAnd I think because early on, frankly,
p424
aVmy programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.
p425
aVBut since then,
p426
aVthe park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk
p427
aVbecame this little thing.
p428
aVBut I did in fact get married in it.
p429
aVOver here.
p430
aVThere goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.
p431
aVThe South Bronx Greenway
p432
aVwas also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.
p433
aVSince then, we got
p434
aVabout 50 million dollars in stimulus package money
p435
aVto come and get here.
p436
aVAnd we love this, because I love construction now,
p437
aVbecause we're watching these things actually happen.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo I want everyone to understand
p440
aVthe critical importance
p441
aVof shifting charity into enterprise.
p442
aVI started my firm to help communities across the country
p443
aVrealize their own potential
p444
aVto improve everything about the quality of life for their people.
p445
aVHometown security
p446
aVis next on my to-do list.
p447
aVWhat we need are people who see the value
p448
aVin investing in these types of local enterprises,
p449
aVwho will partner with folks like me
p450
aVto identify the growth trends and climate adaptation
p451
aVas well as understand the growing social costs
p452
aVof business as usual.
p453
aVWe need to work together
p454
aVto embrace and repair our land,
p455
aVrepair our power systems
p456
aVand repair ourselves.
p457
aVIt's time to stop building
p458
aVthe shopping malls, the prisons,
p459
aVthe stadiums
p460
aVand other tributes to all of our collective failures.
p461
aVIt is time that we start building
p462
aVliving monuments to hope and possibility.
p463
