VOK, so today I want to talk about how we talk about love.
p4
aVAnd specifically,
p5
aVI want to talk about what's wrong with how we talk about love.
p6
aa(lp7
VMost of us will probably fall in love a few times
p8
aVover the course of our lives,
p9
aVand in the English language, this metaphor, falling,
p10
aVis really the main way that we talk about that experience.
p11
aVI don't know about you,
p12
aVbut when I conceptualize this metaphor,
p13
aVwhat I picture is straight out of a cartoon \u2014
p14
aVlike there's a man,
p15
aVhe's walking down the sidewalk,
p16
aVwithout realizing it, he crosses over an open manhole,
p17
aVand he just plummets into the sewer below.
p18
aVAnd I picture it this way because falling is not jumping.
p19
aVFalling is accidental,
p20
aVit's uncontrollable.
p21
aVIt's something that happens to us without our consent.
p22
aVAnd this \u2014
p23
aVthis is the main way we talk about starting a new relationship.
p24
aa(lp25
VI am a writer and I'm also an English teacher,
p26
aVwhich means I think about words for a living.
p27
aVYou could say that I get paid to argue that the language we use matters,
p28
aVand I would like to argue that many of the metaphors we use
p29
aVto talk about love \u2014
p30
aVmaybe even most of them \u2014
p31
aVare a problem.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, in love, we fall.
p34
aVWe're struck.
p35
aVWe are crushed.
p36
aVWe swoon.
p37
aVWe burn with passion.
p38
aVLove makes us crazy,
p39
aVand it makes us sick.
p40
aVOur hearts ache,
p41
aVand then they break.
p42
aVSo our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone
p43
aVto extreme violence or illness.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VThey do.
p48
aVAnd they position us as the victims
p49
aVof unforeseen and totally unavoidable circumstances.
p50
aVMy favorite one of these is "smitten,"
p51
aVwhich is the past participle of the word "smite."
p52
aVAnd if you look this word up in the dictionary \u2014
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
Vyou will see that it can be defined as both "grievous affliction,"
p57
aVand, "to be very much in love."
p58
aVI tend to associate the word "smite" with a very particular context,
p59
aVwhich is the Old Testament.
p60
aVIn the Book of Exodus alone, there are 16 references to smiting,
p61
aVwhich is the word that the Bible uses for the vengeance of an angry God.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VHere we are using the same word to talk about love
p66
aVthat we use to explain a plague of locusts.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VRight?
p71
aa(lp72
VSo, how did this happen?
p73
aVHow have we come to associate love with great pain and suffering?
p74
aVAnd why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience
p75
aVas if we are victims?
p76
aVThese are difficult questions,
p77
aVbut I have some theories.
p78
aVAnd to think this through,
p79
aVI want to focus on one metaphor in particular,
p80
aVwhich is the idea of love as madness.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhen I first started researching romantic love,
p83
aVI found these madness metaphors everywhere.
p84
aVThe history of Western culture
p85
aVis full of language that equates love to mental illness.
p86
aVThese are just a few examples.
p87
aVWilliam Shakespeare:
p88
aV"Love is merely a madness,"
p89
aVfrom "As You Like It."
p90
aVFriedrich Nietzsche:
p91
aV"There is always some madness in love."
p92
aV"Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love \u2014 "
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
Vfrom the great philosopher, Beyoncé Knowles.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VI fell in love for the first time when I was 20,
p101
aVand it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start.
p102
aVAnd it was long distance for the first couple of years,
p103
aVso for me that meant very high highs and very low lows.
p104
aVI can remember one moment in particular.
p105
aVI was sitting on a bed in a hostel in South America,
p106
aVand I was watching the person I love walk out the door.
p107
aVAnd it was late,
p108
aVit was nearly midnight,
p109
aVwe'd gotten into an argument over dinner,
p110
aVand when we got back to our room,
p111
aVhe threw his things in the bag and stormed out.
p112
aVWhile I can no longer remember what that argument was about,
p113
aVI very clearly remember how I felt watching him leave.
p114
aa(lp115
VI was 22, it was my first time in the developing world,
p116
aVand I was totally alone.
p117
aVI had another week until my flight home,
p118
aVand I knew the name of the town that I was in,
p119
aVand the name of the city that I needed to get to to fly out,
p120
aVbut I had no idea how to get around.
p121
aVI had no guidebook and very little money,
p122
aVand I spoke no Spanish.
p123
aa(lp124
VSomeone more adventurous than me
p125
aVmight have seen this as a moment of opportunity,
p126
aVbut I just froze.
p127
aVI just sat there.
p128
aVAnd then I burst into tears.
p129
aVBut despite my panic,
p130
aVsome small voice in my head thought,
p131
aV"Wow. That was dramatic.
p132
aVI must really be doing this love thing right."
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VBecause some part of me wanted to feel miserable in love.
p137
aVAnd it sounds so strange to me now, but at 22,
p138
aVI longed to have dramatic experiences,
p139
aVand in that moment, I was irrational and furious and devastated,
p140
aVand weirdly enough,
p141
aVI thought that this somehow legitimized the feelings I had
p142
aVfor the guy who had just left me.
p143
aa(lp144
VI think on some level I wanted to feel a little bit crazy,
p145
aVbecause I thought that that was how loved worked.
p146
aVThis really should not be surprising,
p147
aVconsidering that according to Wikipedia,
p148
aVthere are eight films,
p149
aV14 songs,
p150
aVtwo albums and one novel with the title "Crazy Love."
p151
aa(lp152
VAbout half an hour later, he came back to our room.
p153
aVWe made up.
p154
aVWe spent another mostly happy week traveling together.
p155
aVAnd then, when I got home,
p156
aVI thought, "That was so terrible and so great.
p157
aVThis must be a real romance."
p158
aVI expected my first love to feel like madness,
p159
aVand of course, it met that expectation very well.
p160
aVBut loving someone like that \u2014
p161
aVas if my entire well-being depended on him loving me back \u2014
p162
aVwas not very good for me
p163
aVor for him.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut I suspect this experience of love is not that unusual.
p166
aVMost of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love.
p167
aVIn fact, there is research to confirm that this is somewhat normal,
p168
aVbecause, neurochemically speaking,
p169
aVromantic love and mental illness are not that easily distinguished.
p170
aVThis is true.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis study from 1999 used blood tests
p173
aVto confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love
p174
aVvery closely resembled the serotonin levels
p175
aVof people who had been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VYes, and low levels of serotonin
p180
aVare also associated with seasonal affective disorder
p181
aVand depression.
p182
aVSo there is some evidence
p183
aVthat love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors.
p184
aVAnd there are other studies to confirm
p185
aVthat most relationships begin this way.
p186
aa(lp187
VResearchers believe that the low levels of serotonin
p188
aVis correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love,
p189
aVwhich is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain.
p190
aVAnd most of us feel this way when we first fall in love.
p191
aVBut the good news is, it doesn't always last that long \u2014
p192
aVusually from a few months to a couple of years.
p193
aa(lp194
VWhen I got back from my trip to South America,
p195
aVI spent a lot of time alone in my room,
p196
aVchecking my email,
p197
aVdesperate to hear from the guy I loved.
p198
aVI decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction,
p199
aVthen I did not need their friendship.
p200
aVSo I stopped hanging out with most of them.
p201
aVAnd it was probably the most unhappy year of my life.
p202
aVBut I think I felt like it was my job to be miserable,
p203
aVbecause if I could be miserable,
p204
aVthen I would prove how much I loved him.
p205
aVAnd if I could prove it,
p206
aVthen we would have to end up together eventually.
p207
aa(lp208
VThis is the real madness,
p209
aVbecause there is no cosmic rule
p210
aVthat says that great suffering equals great reward,
p211
aVbut we talk about love as if this is true.
p212
aa(lp213
VOur experiences of love are both biological and cultural.
p214
aVOur biology tells us that love is good
p215
aVby activating these reward circuits in our brain,
p216
aVand it tells us that love is painful when, after a fight or a breakup,
p217
aVthat neurochemical reward is withdrawn.
p218
aVAnd in fact \u2014 and maybe you've heard this \u2014
p219
aVneurochemically speaking,
p220
aVgoing through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal,
p221
aVwhich I find reassuring.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd then our culture uses language
p226
aVto shape and reinforce these ideas about love.
p227
aVIn this case, we're talking about metaphors about pain
p228
aVand addiction and madness.
p229
aVIt's kind of an interesting feedback loop.
p230
aVLove is powerful and at times painful,
p231
aVand we express this in our words and stories,
p232
aVbut then our words and stories prime us
p233
aVto expect love to be powerful and painful.
p234
aa(lp235
VWhat's interesting to me is that all of this happens
p236
aVin a culture that values lifelong monogamy.
p237
aVIt seems like we want it both ways:
p238
aVwe want love to feel like madness,
p239
aVand we want it to last an entire lifetime.
p240
aVThat sounds terrible.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VTo reconcile this,
p245
aVwe need to either change our culture or change our expectations.
p246
aVSo, imagine if we were all less passive in love.
p247
aVIf we were more assertive, more open-minded, more generous
p248
aVand instead of falling in love,
p249
aVwe stepped into love.
p250
aVI know that this is asking a lot,
p251
aVbut I'm not actually the first person to suggest this.
p252
aVIn their book, "Metaphors We Live By,"
p253
aVlinguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff suggest a really interesting solution
p254
aVto this dilemma,
p255
aVwhich is to change our metaphors.
p256
aVThey argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world,
p257
aVand that they can even act as a guide for future actions,
p258
aVlike self-fulfilling prophecies.
p259
aa(lp260
VJohnson and Lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love:
p261
aVlove as a collaborative work of art.
p262
aVI really like this way of thinking about love.
p263
aVLinguists talk about metaphors as having entailments,
p264
aVwhich is essentially a way of considering all the implications of,
p265
aVor ideas contained within, a given metaphor.
p266
aVAnd Johnson and Lakoff talk about everything
p267
aVthat collaborating on a work of art entails:
p268
aVeffort, compromise, patience, shared goals.
p269
aVThese ideas align nicely with our cultural investment
p270
aVin long-term romantic commitment,
p271
aVbut they also work well for other kinds of relationships \u2014
p272
aVshort-term, casual, polyamorous, non-monogamous, asexual \u2014
p273
aVbecause this metaphor brings much more complex ideas
p274
aVto the experience of loving someone.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo if love is a collaborative work of art,
p277
aVthen love is an aesthetic experience.
p278
aVLove is unpredictable,
p279
aVlove is creative,
p280
aVlove requires communication and discipline,
p281
aVit is frustrating and emotionally demanding.
p282
aVAnd love involves both joy and pain.
p283
aVUltimately, each experience of love is different.
p284
aa(lp285
VWhen I was younger,
p286
aVit never occurred to me that I was allowed to demand more from love,
p287
aVthat I didn't have to just accept whatever love offered.
p288
aVWhen 14-year-old Juliet first meets \u2014
p289
aVor, when 14-year-old Juliet cannot be with Romeo,
p290
aVwhom she has met four days ago,
p291
aVshe does not feel disappointed or angsty.
p292
aVWhere is she?
p293
aVShe wants to die.
p294
aVRight?
p295
aVAnd just as a refresher, at this point in the play,
p296
aVact three of five,
p297
aVRomeo is not dead.
p298
aVHe's alive,
p299
aVhe's healthy,
p300
aVhe's just been banished from the city.
p301
aVI understand that 16th-century Verona is unlike contemporary North America,
p302
aVand yet when I first read this play,
p303
aValso at age 14,
p304
aVJuliet's suffering made sense to me.
p305
aa(lp306
VReframing love as something I get to create with someone I admire,
p307
aVrather than something that just happens to me
p308
aVwithout my control or consent,
p309
aVis empowering.
p310
aVIt's still hard.
p311
aVLove still feels totally maddening and crushing some days,
p312
aVand when I feel really frustrated,
p313
aVI have to remind myself:
p314
aVmy job in this relationship is to talk to my partner
p315
aVabout what I want to make together.
p316
aVThis isn't easy, either.
p317
aVBut it's just so much better than the alternative,
p318
aVwhich is that thing that feels like madness.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis version of love is not about winning or losing someone's affection.
p321
aVInstead, it requires that you trust your partner
p322
aVand talk about things when trusting feels difficult,
p323
aVwhich sounds so simple,
p324
aVbut is actually a kind of revolutionary, radical act.
p325
aVThis is because you get to stop thinking about yourself
p326
aVand what you're gaining or losing in your relationship,
p327
aVand you get to start thinking about what you have to offer.
p328
aVThis version of love allows us to say things like,
p329
aV"Hey, we're not very good collaborators. Maybe this isn't for us."
p330
aVOr, "That relationship was shorter than I had planned,
p331
aVbut it was still kind of beautiful."
p332
aa(lp333
VThe beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art
p334
aVis that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself.
p335
aVThis version of love allows us to decide what it looks like.
p336
aa(lp337
VThank you.
