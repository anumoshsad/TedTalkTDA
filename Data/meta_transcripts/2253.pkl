VI know what you're thinking:
p4
aV"Why does that guy get to sit down?"
p5
aVThat's because this is radio.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Music)
p8
aa(lp9
VI tell radio stories about design,
p10
aVand I report on all kinds of stories:
p11
aVbuildings and toothbrushes, mascots and wayfinding and fonts.
p12
aVMy mission is to get people to engage with the design that they care about
p13
aVso they begin to pay attention to all forms of design.
p14
aVWhen you decode the world with design intent in mind,
p15
aVthe world becomes kind of magical.
p16
aVInstead of seeing the broken things,
p17
aVyou see all the little bits of genius
p18
aVthat anonymous designers have sweated over to make our lives better.
p19
aVAnd that's essentially the definition of design:
p20
aVmaking life better and providing joy.
p21
aVAnd few things give me greater joy
p22
aVthan a well-designed flag.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VYeah!
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VHappy 50th anniversary on your flag, Canada.
p31
aVIt is beautiful, gold standard.
p32
aVLove it.
p33
aa(lp34
VI'm kind of obsessed with flags.
p35
aVSometimes I bring up the topic of flags,
p36
aVand people are like, "I don't care about flags,"
p37
aVand then we start talking about flags, and trust me,
p38
aV100 percent of people care about flags.
p39
aVThere's just something about them that works on our emotions.
p40
aa(lp41
VMy family wrapped my Christmas presents as flags this year,
p42
aVincluding the blue gift bag that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.
p43
aVI put this picture online, and sure enough,
p44
aVwithin the first few minutes, someone left a comment that said,
p45
aV"You can take that Scottish Saltire and shove it up your ass."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSee, people are passionate about flags, you know?
p50
aVThat's the way it is.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat I love about flags
p53
aVis that once you understand the design of flags,
p54
aVwhat makes a good flag, what makes a bad flag,
p55
aVyou can understand the design of almost anything.
p56
aVSo what I'm going to do here is,
p57
aVI cracked open an episode of my radio show,
p58
aV"99% Invisible," and I'm going to reconstruct it here on stage,
p59
aVso when I press a button over here \u2014
p60
aVVoice: S for Sound \u2014
p61
aVRoman Mars: It's going to make a sound,
p62
aVand so whenever you hear a sound or a voice or a piece of music,
p63
aVit's because I pressed a button.
p64
aa(lp65
VVoice: Sound.
p66
aa(lp67
VRM: All right, got it? Here we go.
p68
aVThree, two.
p69
aa(lp70
VThis is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Music)
p73
aa(lp74
VNarrator: The five basic principles of flag design.
p75
aa(lp76
VRoman Mars: According to the North American Vexillological Association.
p77
aVVexillological.
p78
aa(lp79
VTed Kaye: Vexillology is the study of flags.
p80
aa(lp81
VRM: It's that extra "lol" that makes it sound weird.
p82
aa(lp83
VNarrator: Number one, keep it simple.
p84
aVThe flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
p85
aa(lp86
VRM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,
p87
aVI didn't even know cities had their own flags.
p88
aa(lp89
VTK: Most larger cities do have flags.
p90
aa(lp91
VRM: Well, I didn't know that, that's Ted Kaye, by the way.
p92
aa(lp93
VTK: Hello.
p94
aVRM: He's a flag expert, he's a totally awesome guy.
p95
aa(lp96
VTK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited a scholarly journal on flag studies,
p97
aVand I am currently involved with the Portland Flag Association
p98
aVand the North American Vexillological Association.
p99
aa(lp100
VRM: Ted literally wrote the book on flag design.
p101
aa(lp102
VNarrator: "Good Flag, Bad Flag."
p103
aa(lp104
VRM: It's more of a pamphlet, really, it's about 16 pages.
p105
aa(lp106
VTK: Yes, it's called "Good Flag, Bad Flag: How to Design a Great Flag."
p107
aa(lp108
VRM: And that first city flag I discovered in Chicago
p109
aVis a beaut:
p110
aVwhite field, two horizontal blue stripes,
p111
aVand four six-pointed red stars down the middle.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Sound)
p114
aa(lp115
VNarrator: Number two, use meaningful symbolism.
p116
aa(lp117
VTK: The blue stripes represent the water, the river and the lake.
p118
aa(lp119
VNarrator: The flag's images, colors or pattern
p120
aVshould relate to what it symbolizes.
p121
aa(lp122
VTK: The red stars represent significant events in Chicago's history.
p123
aa(lp124
VRM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn on the future site of Chicago,
p125
aVthe Great Chicago Fire,
p126
aVthe World Columbian Exposition, which everyone remembers
p127
aVbecause of the White City,
p128
aVand the Century of Progress Exposition, which no one remembers at all.
p129
aa(lp130
VNarrator: Number three, use two to three basic colors.
p131
aa(lp132
VTK: The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors
p133
aVfrom the standard color set: red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.
p134
aa(lp135
VRM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in
p136
aVwith an entire cross-section of the city.
p137
aVIt is everywhere;
p138
aVevery municipal building flies the flag.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhet Moser: There's probably at least one store on every block
p141
aVnear where I work that sells some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.
p142
aa(lp143
VRM: That's Whet Moser from Chicago magazine.
p144
aa(lp145
VWM: Today, just for example, I went to get a haircut,
p146
aVand when I sat down in the barber's chair,
p147
aVthere was a Chicago flag on the box that the barber kept all his tools in,
p148
aVand then in the mirror, there was a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.
p149
aVWhen I left, a guy passed me who had a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.
p150
aa(lp151
VRM: It's adaptable and remixable.
p152
aVThe six-pointed stars in particular show up in all kinds of places.
p153
aa(lp154
VWM: The coffee I bought the other day had a Chicago star on it.
p155
aa(lp156
VRM: It's a distinct symbol of Chicago pride.
p157
aa(lp158
VTK: When a police officer or a firefighter dies in Chicago,
p159
aVoften it's not the flag of the United States on his casket.
p160
aVIt can be the flag of the city of Chicago.
p161
aVThat's how deeply the flag has gotten into the civic imagery of Chicago.
p162
aa(lp163
VRM: And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag.
p164
aVI also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool.
p165
aa(lp166
VTK: A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride.
p167
aa(lp168
VRM: OK, so when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008,
p169
aVI researched its flag,
p170
aVbecause I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.
p171
aVAnd I found it, I am sorry to say,
p172
aVsadly lacking.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VI know.
p177
aVIt hurts me, too.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VTK: Well, let me start from the top.
p182
aa(lp183
VNarrator: Number one, keep it simple.
p184
aa(lp185
VTK: Keeping it simple.
p186
aa(lp187
VNarrator: The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
p188
aa(lp189
VTK: It's a relatively complex flag.
p190
aa(lp191
VRM: OK, here we go, OK.
p192
aVThe main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix
p193
aVrepresenting the city rising from the ashes
p194
aVafter the devastating fires of the 1850s.
p195
aa(lp196
VTK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.
p197
aa(lp198
VRM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.
p199
aVDesign-wise, it manages to both be too crude
p200
aVand have too many details at the same time,
p201
aVwhich if you were trying for that,
p202
aVyou wouldn't be able to do it,
p203
aVand it just looks bad at a distance,
p204
aVbut having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column.
p205
aVBehind the phoenix, the background is mostly white,
p206
aVand then it has a substantial gold border around it.
p207
aa(lp208
VTK: Which is a very attractive design element.
p209
aa(lp210
VRM: I think it's OK, but \u2014
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aVhere come the big no-nos of flag design.
p214
aa(lp215
VNarrator: Number four, no lettering or seals.
p216
aVNever use writing of any kind.
p217
aa(lp218
VRM: Underneath the phoenix, there's a motto on a ribbon
p219
aVthat translates to "Gold in peace, iron in war,"
p220
aVplus \u2014 and this is the big problem \u2014
p221
aVit says San Francisco across the bottom.
p222
aa(lp223
VTK: If you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag,
p224
aVyour symbolism has failed.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VRM: The United States flag doesn't say "USA" across the front.
p231
aVIn fact, country flags, they tend to behave.
p232
aVLike, hats off to South Africa and Turkey and Israel
p233
aVand Somalia and Japan and Gambia.
p234
aVThere's a bunch of really great country flags,
p235
aVbut they obey good design principles because the stakes are high.
p236
aVThey're on the international stage.
p237
aVBut city, state and regional flags are another story.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VThere is a scourge of bad flags \u2014
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
Vand they must be stopped.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Laughter)
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
VThat is the truth and that is the dare.
p252
aVThe first step is to recognize that we have a problem.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VA lot of people tend to think that good design
p257
aVis just a matter of taste,
p258
aVand quite honestly, sometimes it is, actually,
p259
aVbut sometimes it isn't, all right?
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VHere's the full list of NAVA flag design principles.
p264
aa(lp265
VNarrator: The five basic principles of flag design.
p266
aa(lp267
VNarrator: Number one. TK: Keep it simple.
p268
aa(lp269
VNarrator: Number two. TK: Use meaningful symbolism.
p270
aa(lp271
VNarrator: Number three. TK: Use two to three basic colors.
p272
aa(lp273
VNarrator: Number four. TK: No lettering or seals.
p274
aa(lp275
VNarrator: Never use writing of any kind.
p276
aa(lp277
VTK: Because you can't read that at a distance.
p278
aa(lp279
VNarrator: Number five. TK: And be distinctive.
p280
aa(lp281
VRM: All the best flags tend to stick to these principles.
p282
aVAnd like I said before, most country flags are OK.
p283
aVBut here's the thing:
p284
aVif you showed this list of principles to any designer of almost anything,
p285
aVthey would say these principles \u2014 simplicity, deep meaning,
p286
aVhaving few colors or being thoughtful about colors,
p287
aVuniqueness, don't have writing you can't read \u2014
p288
aVall those principles apply to them, too.
p289
aVBut sadly, good design principles are rarely invoked in US city flags.
p290
aVOur biggest problem seems to be that fourth one.
p291
aVWe just can't stop ourselves from putting our names on our flags,
p292
aVor little municipal seals with tiny writing on them.
p293
aVHere's the thing about municipal seals:
p294
aVThey were designed to be on pieces of paper
p295
aVwhere you can read them,
p296
aVnot on flags 100 feet away flapping in the breeze.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo here's a bunch of flags again.
p299
aVVexillologists call these SOBs:
p300
aVSeals on a bedsheet \u2014
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
Vand if you can't tell what city they go to,
p305
aVyeah, that's exactly the problem,
p306
aVexcept for Anaheim, apparently, they fixed it.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VThese flags are everywhere in the US.
p311
aVThe European equivalent of the municipal seal
p312
aVis the city coat of arms ...
p313
aVand this is where we can learn a lesson for how to do things right.
p314
aVSo this is the city coat of arms of Amsterdam.
p315
aVNow, if this were a United States city,
p316
aVthe flag would probably look like this.
p317
aVYou know, yeah.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VBut instead, the flag of Amsterdam
p322
aVlooks like this.
p323
aVRather than plopping the whole coat of arms
p324
aVon a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it,
p325
aVthey just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield,
p326
aVand they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd because it's so badass,
p333
aVthose flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam,
p334
aVjust like Chicago, they're used.
p335
aa(lp336
VEven though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags are particularly painful
p337
aVand offensive to me,
p338
aVnothing can quite prepare you
p339
aVfor one of the biggest train wrecks in vexillological history.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VAre you ready?
p344
aVIt's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VI mean, it's distinctive,
p349
aVI'll give them that.
p350
aa(lp351
VSteve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.
p352
aa(lp353
VRM: The city ran a contest
p354
aVand gathered a bunch of submissions with all kinds of designs.
p355
aa(lp356
VSK: And an alderman by the name of Fred Steffan
p357
aVcobbled together parts of the submissions to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.
p358
aa(lp359
VRM: It's a kitchen sink flag.
p360
aVThere's a gigantic gear representing industry,
p361
aVthere's a ship recognizing the port,
p362
aVa giant stalk of wheat
p363
aVpaying homage to the brewing industry.
p364
aVIt's a hot mess,
p365
aVand Steve Kodis, a graphic designer from Milwaukee, wants to change it.
p366
aa(lp367
VSK: It's really awful.
p368
aVIt's a misstep on the city's behalf,
p369
aVto say the least.
p370
aa(lp371
VRM: But what puts the Milwaukee flag over the top,
p372
aValmost to the point of self-parody,
p373
aVis on it is a picture of the Civil War battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.
p374
aa(lp375
VSK: So that's the final element in it
p376
aVthat just makes it that much more ridiculous,
p377
aVthat there is a flag design within the Milwaukee flag.
p378
aa(lp379
VRM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VYeah.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Music)
p386
aa(lp387
VNow, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.
p388
aVI've been there, I love it.
p389
aVThe most depressing part of this flag, though,
p390
aVis that there have been two major redesign contests.
p391
aVThe last one was held in 2001.
p392
aV105 entries were received.
p393
aa(lp394
VTK: But in the end, the members of the Milwaukee Arts Board
p395
aVdecided that none of the new entries were worthy of flying over the city.
p396
aa(lp397
VRM: They couldn't agree to change that thing!
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VThat's discouraging enough to make you think
p402
aVthat good design and democracy just simply do not go together.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Laughter)
p405
aa(lp406
VBut Steve Kotas is going to try one more time
p407
aVto redesign the Milwaukee flag.
p408
aa(lp409
VSK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.
p410
aVEvery great city deserves a great flag.
p411
aa(lp412
VRM: Steve isn't ready to reveal his design yet.
p413
aVOne of the things about proposing one of these things
p414
aVis you have to get people on board,
p415
aVand then you reveal your design.
p416
aVBut here's the trick:
p417
aVIf you want to design a great flag,
p418
aVa kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's, which also has a great flag,
p419
aVstart by drawing a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
p420
aVon a piece of paper.
p421
aVYour design has to fit within that tiny rectangle.
p422
aVHere's why.
p423
aa(lp424
VTK: A three-by-five-foot flag on a pole 100 feet away
p425
aVlooks about the same size as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
p426
aVseen about 15 inches from your eye.
p427
aVYou'd be surprised by how compelling and simple the design can be
p428
aVwhen you hold yourself to that limitation.
p429
aa(lp430
VRM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.
p431
aVIs there anything we can do?
p432
aa(lp433
VTK: I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.
p434
aVThe way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag
p435
aVis to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance.
p436
aVTake the name off,
p437
aVand the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.
p438
aVAnd I would simply take the phoenix
p439
aVand make it a great big element in the middle of the flag.
p440
aa(lp441
VRM: But the current phoenix, that's got to go.
p442
aa(lp443
VTK: I would simplify or stylize the phoenix.
p444
aVDepict a big, wide-winged bird
p445
aVcoming out of flames.
p446
aVEmphasize those flames.
p447
aa(lp448
VRM: So this San Francisco flag was designed by Frank Chimero
p449
aVbased on Ted Kaye's suggestions.
p450
aVI don't know what he would do if we was completely unfettered
p451
aVand didn't follow those guidelines.
p452
aVFans of my radio show and podcast, heard me complain about bad flags.
p453
aVThey've sent me other suggested designs.
p454
aVThis one's by Neil Mussett.
p455
aVBoth are so much better.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Laughter)
p458
aa(lp459
VAnd I think if they were adopted,
p460
aVI would see them around the city.
p461
aa(lp462
VIn my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful,
p463
aVmany listeners have taken it upon themselves
p464
aVto redesign their flags and look into the feasibility
p465
aVof getting them officially adopted.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Music)
p468
aa(lp469
VIf you see your city flag and like it,
p470
aVfly it,
p471
aVeven if it violates a design rule or two.
p472
aVI don't care.
p473
aVBut if you don't see your city flag,
p474
aVmaybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,
p475
aVand it just sucks,
p476
aVand I dare you to join the effort to try to change that.
p477
aa(lp478
VAs we move more and more into cities,
p479
aVthe city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place,
p480
aVbut also, it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself,
p481
aVespecially today, as the populace is becoming more design-aware.
p482
aVAnd I think design awareness is at an all-time high.
p483
aVA well-designed flag could be seen as an indicator of how a city
p484
aVconsiders all of its design systems:
p485
aVits public transit,
p486
aVits parks, its signage.
p487
aVIt might seem frivolous, but it's not.
p488
aa(lp489
VTK: Often when city leaders say,
p490
aV"We have more important things to do than worry about a city flag,"
p491
aVmy response is,
p492
aV"If you had a great city flag,
p493
aVyou would have a banner for people to rally under
p494
aVto face those more important things."
p495
aa(lp496
V(Music)
p497
aa(lp498
VRM: I've seen firsthand what a good city flag can do
p499
aVin the case of Chicago.
p500
aVThe marriage of good design and civic pride
p501
aVis something that we need in all places.
p502
aVThe best part about municipal flags is that we own them.
p503
aVThey are an open-source,
p504
aVpublicly owned design language of the community.
p505
aVWhen they are done well,
p506
aVthey are remixable, adaptable, and they are powerful.
p507
aVWe could control the branding and graphical imagery
p508
aVof our cities with a good flag,
p509
