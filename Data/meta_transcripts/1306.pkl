(lp3
VSo, my name is Roger Doiron,
p4
aVand I have a subversive plot.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
V(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VIt is so subversive, in fact,
p11
aVthat it has the potential to radically alter the balance of power,
p12
aVnot only in our own country,
p13
aVbut in the entire world.
p14
aVNow I realize, I'm sounding \u2014
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
Va little bit like Dr. Evil now.
p19
aVI understand that.
p20
aVBut trust me \u2014 we have very, very little in common.
p21
aVHis plots are all about destruction and secrecy,
p22
aVwhereas my plots are about creation and openness.
p23
aVIn fact, my plot can only work
p24
aVif I share it with as many people as possible.
p25
aVSo I'm going to share it with you now,
p26
aVbut you have to promise me you're going to share it in turn.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo here it is.
p29
aVHuh. That's not so good, is it?
p30
aVThere's nothing particularly radical or revolutionary about a patch of grass.
p31
aVWhat starts to get interesting is when we turn it into this.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, I would like to suggest to you all
p34
aVthat gardening is a subversive activity.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThink about this: food is a form of energy.
p39
aVIt's what our body runs on,
p40
aVbut it's also a form of power.
p41
aVAnd when we encourage people to grow some of their own food,
p42
aVwe're encouraging them to take power into their hands,
p43
aVpower over their diet,
p44
aVpower over their health
p45
aVand some power over their pocketbooks.
p46
aVSo I think that's quite subversive, because we're also necessarily
p47
aVtalking about taking that power away
p48
aVfrom someone else,
p49
aVfrom other actors in society that currently have power
p50
aVover food and health.
p51
aVYou can think about who those actors might be.
p52
aa(lp53
VI also look at gardening as a sort of healthy gateway drug,
p54
aVyou might say, to other forms of food freedom.
p55
aVIt's not long after you plant a garden
p56
aVthat you start to say, "Hey, I need to start to learn how to cook."
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
V"You know, I might want to look into food preservation
p61
aVor I might want to look up where my local farmer's market
p62
aVis located in my town."
p63
aa(lp64
VNow the other thing, of course, with planting a garden,
p65
aVespecially a garden in front of a white house
p66
aVand on a sunny south lawn,
p67
aVis you never know who you might influence.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, I'm not exactly sure what my white house garden's influence
p72
aVwas on the First Lady's,
p73
aVbut I can tell you this:
p74
aVshe's had an enormous influence on me
p75
aVsince planting hers.
p76
aVNow it hasn't been \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
Vit hasn't been in the area of fashion.
p81
aVI understand that she's just in a completely different league there,
p82
aVand I'm not even trying to compete.
p83
aVBut she's really inspired me to think much more boldly
p84
aVabout the role that I want to have in the garden movement.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd so this is sort of what I'm aspiring to here.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, pretty modest, right?
p91
aVI like this picture.
p92
aVI think it sort of captures me well,
p93
aVnot that I have any divine connections whatsoever,
p94
aVbut I like my facial expression there,
p95
aVbecause, if I've got a worried look on my face,
p96
aVit's not simply because I've got 20 pounds of squash over my head,
p97
aVbut it's because I've got some pretty heavy topics on my mind.
p98
aVAnd I want to share some of those with you right now,
p99
aVstarting off in the form of a very short video I've produced for you,
p100
aVwhich is my best effort to sum up the history of gastronomy
p101
aVin about 15 seconds.
p102
aa(lp103
V("Also sprach Zarathustra" plays)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VSo, here we are.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, that's a funny little clip,
p112
aVbut it'd be even funnier if it weren't so tragic
p113
aVand if it weren't so true.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe reality is that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic,
p116
aVand it's not simply limited to our country.
p117
aVIt's spreading around the world right now.
p118
aVAnd in a sort of parallel universe,
p119
aVwe're also seeing that hunger is on the rise.
p120
aVOver 900 million people right now are affected by it.
p121
aVThat's three times the population of the United States.
p122
aVBut at the same time,
p123
aVworld food prices are rising
p124
aVand world population is rising and is set to reach 10 billion people
p125
aVby the end of the century.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, another thing about the population is we know that it's increasing,
p128
aVbut a lot of us don't realize that it's also changing.
p129
aVThere's a fundamental shift taking place.
p130
aVAs of 2007, we went from being a primarily rural planet
p131
aVto being a primarily urban one,
p132
aVand that has implications for how we're going to feed these people,
p133
aVhow we're going to get the food to the people in the cities.
p134
aVNow, I imagine that there are some Stephen King fans
p135
aVin the audience here,
p136
aVand I'm one of them.
p137
aVBut I can tell you, I haven't read anything scarier than this here,
p138
aVand that's this statistic:
p139
aVin order to keep up with the growing population,
p140
aVwe're going to need to grow more food over the course of the next 50 years
p141
aVthan we have grown over the course of the past 10,000 years combined.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat makes this even more challenging
p144
aVis that we're going to need to grow all this food with less,
p145
aVand when I say less,
p146
aVI mean a number of things.
p147
aVLess oil, for example.
p148
aVMost reputable geologists believe that we've already reached
p149
aVpeak oil production in the world.
p150
aVNow, you might not think in terms of oil and food as being linked,
p151
aVbut there's a very strong link, in fact.
p152
aVIt takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy
p153
aVin our highly industrialized food system
p154
aVin order to produce one calorie of food energy.
p155
aVWe'll also need to grow more food with less water.
p156
aVThese three images come from three very different parts of the planet,
p157
aVbut they all tell the same story of catastrophic drought.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe'll also need to grow more food with less farmland.
p160
aVHere, the pressures differ from one place to the next.
p161
aVIn the Global South, we're seeing desertification,
p162
aVwhereas in the north, we're seeing suburban sprawl.
p163
aa(lp164
VWe'll also have to grow more food with less climate stability
p165
aVand less genetic diversity.
p166
aVNow, this is really important.
p167
aVWe need our genetic varieties
p168
aVbecause they're a sort of insurance policy against climate change.
p169
aVWe heard earlier today
p170
aV"not putting all of our eggs in one basket."
p171
aVWell, we shouldn't be doing the same with our tomatoes, either.
p172
aa(lp173
VWe're also going to need to grow more food with less time.
p174
aVNow here, I'm not simply talking about the ticking time bomb
p175
aVthat is the global population.
p176
aVI'm talking about the amount of time we all have
p177
aVin order to put a decent meal on the table.
p178
aVAnd that "31" figure there is not something arbitrary.
p179
aVThat's the average amount of time the American family spends
p180
aVpreparing, eating and cleaning up after meals per day.
p181
aV31 minutes.
p182
aVSo somewhere in there, we're going to need to also fit in growing food.
p183
aVAlright?
p184
aVAnd I think we do need to do that,
p185
aVbut that's also going to mean that somewhere along the way,
p186
aVsomething's going to have to give.
p187
aVSo it sort of leaves us feeling like this.
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VYou know?
p192
aVIt's time to leave town or even perhaps leave planets.
p193
aVBut where do we go?
p194
aVWhere do we go when we only have one planet?
p195
aVAnd where do we go where the going gets tough?
p196
aa(lp197
VWell, if we were to listen to a lot of our political leaders over the years,
p198
aVwe would simply go shopping.
p199
aVRight?
p200
aVBecause we have this unwavering belief,
p201
aVespecially in American political culture,
p202
aVthat we can shop our way out of just about any problem.
p203
aVBut the reality is something different.
p204
aVWe're not going to solve our food problems and our health problems
p205
aVsimply by switching from regular Coke
p206
aVto some future green iteration thereof.
p207
aVAnd although the large food companies would like us to believe
p208
aVthat we can give our children all of the vitamins, minerals
p209
aVand immunity-building substances that they need
p210
aVwithout even leaving the chocolatey cereal aisle \u2014
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
Vthe truth is something quite different.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, what's become even more troublesome of late
p217
aVis that even the foods that ought to be healthy aren't always so,
p218
aVand we're starting to lose confidence in our food system, I think.
p219
aVThe bigger it becomes and the more complex it becomes.
p220
aVAnd we've seen this time and time again.
p221
aVThis is an image from the latest E. coli outbreak.
p222
aVIn this case, it was in Europe,
p223
aVand we think it was started with bean sprouts, of all things.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo we have this sort of shopper's dilemma right now.
p226
aVWe have all of these different foods \u2014
p227
aV30,000 foods in the average big-box grocery store \u2014
p228
aVbut we have less confidence in those foods,
p229
aVand we have less confidence in the actors
p230
aVthat are putting those foods on the shelves.
p231
aVI think we need to redefine what good food is.
p232
aVThis is an interesting image from Berlin, Germany,
p233
aVwhere somebody started planting shopping carts and leaving them around.
p234
aVThose are potatoes, by the way.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut in addition to redefining what good food is,
p237
aVI think we need to redefine our living spaces.
p238
aVInstead of seeing this as a yard,
p239
aVwe need to think of it more as like a full-service greengrocer.
p240
aVThat's, in fact, my yard, and that's how I look at it.
p241
aVThat's what we transformed our yard into,
p242
aVand I think a really key message is this one:
p243
aVgardens grow good food.
p244
aVAnd when I say good food,
p245
aVI mean a number of different things.
p246
aVI mean food that is safe,
p247
aVfood that is healthy,
p248
aVfood that is absolutely gorgeous
p249
aVand delicious.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnother important message is this one:
p252
aVgardens grow healthy kids and families.
p253
aVThose happen to be my two youngest sons,
p254
aVand they look healthy and they are healthy,
p255
aVand I think it has to do with the fact that they grew up in gardens
p256
aVand they know where good food comes from.
p257
aVAnd in fact, they know how to grow some of it themselves.
p258
aVBut in the current economy, I think it's key to get this message out,
p259
aVthat gardens also grow important economic savings for families.
p260
aVAnd you can pretty much take my word on this one,
p261
aVbecause in addition to crunching the vegetables a couple of years ago,
p262
aVmy wife and I also crunched the numbers,
p263
aVand we found out that at the end,
p264
aVwe had saved well over 2,000 dollars by growing our own food.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo you could be asking this question now:
p267
aVIf gardens grow all of these great things, how do we grow more gardens?
p268
aVThat's, in fact, the question that my organization,
p269
aVKitchen Gardens International,
p270
aVis both asking and answering.
p271
aVAnd our answer is essentially this one:
p272
aVwe're going to need to leverage the resources and power that we have,
p273
aVthe gardens and gardeners that we have,
p274
aVin order to grow and inspire even more.
p275
aVAnd as I said before, you never know who you might inspire.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VNow if this campaign was successful,
p280
aVI think it wasn't simply because we had a visionary First Lady
p281
aVtaking up residence at the White House \u2014
p282
aVthat certainly was a major part of it \u2014
p283
aVand it wasn't simply because we had some celebrity chefs and authors
p284
aVsaying this would be a good idea to do.
p285
aVI think it was ultimately made possible
p286
aVby the fact that there were a lot of people who wanted it to happen.
p287
aVThere was a movement that made it happen.
p288
aVAnd my organization tried to sort of channel some of that energy
p289
aVof the movement
p290
aVand direct it towards the White House.
p291
aVAnd we had a lot of luck
p292
aVin terms of getting our message out there to the media.
p293
aVWe had a petition on Facebook, 110,000 signatures.
p294
aVWe had viral images and videos,
p295
aVand we did crazy things like symbolically putting the White House lawn
p296
aVup for sale on eBay.
p297
aa(lp298
VBut we need to do even more,
p299
aVand what we're trying to do in my organization
p300
aVis to connect people online,
p301
aVbut also to connect people in person.
p302
aVThis is an image from a little holiday we invented
p303
aVcalled "World Kitchen Garden Day."
p304
aVIt's at the end of August each year,
p305
aVand it's just about bringing people together in gardens
p306
aVto learn from one another,
p307
aVto experience a garden as a community experience.
p308
aVWe also need to grow the next generation of gardeners,
p309
aVand we're doing that in the United States and abroad.
p310
aa(lp311
VBut there's still so much more that needs to be done,
p312
aVand I think this slide sort of captures where we need to go.
p313
aVWe need a road map,
p314
aVand I picked this slide for a reason.
p315
aVWe've got a bike garden on the left
p316
aVand a map of the Netherlands on the right.
p317
aVI was in the Netherlands early this year
p318
aVand was absolutely amazed by the amount of bikes on the road;
p319
aV26 percent of all trips taken in the Netherlands are by bicycle,
p320
aVand it's gotten me thinking:
p321
aVHow do we get that happening in terms of food and gardens?
p322
aVHow would we get 26 percent of all produce coming from backyard gardens?
p323
aVThat might sound like a lot,
p324
aVbecause we're probably at about two percent at the most right now.
p325
aVBut if you take into consideration
p326
aVthat at the peak of the victory garden movement last century,
p327
aV40 percent of all produce was coming from gardens.
p328
aVWe can get there again.
p329
aVAnd I think this is a really good start.
p330
aVThe White House garden is certainly very inspirational.
p331
aVThat's actually sort of a snapshot of what the garden looked like
p332
aVwhen it was planted earlier this spring \u2014
p333
aVlots of diversity, lots of healthy crops.
p334
aVHowever, this is not a good representation
p335
aVof our federal agriculture policy.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VIf we were to take the model here, the diagram of that particular garden,
p340
aVand sort of transpose it onto our federal agriculture policy,
p341
aVwe'd get this:
p342
aVbillions of billions of dollars going to support
p343
aVjust a handful of commodity crops
p344
aVwith just that tiny little bit at the top for fruits and vegetables.
p345
aVThis is scandalous. This is scandalous.
p346
aVWe need to do something about this.
p347
aVI think one place we could start is we could look at the tax code.
p348
aVWe're already using the tax code to encourage green transport
p349
aVand green shelter.
p350
aVWhy not green food?
p351
aVWe're in the midst now of talking about another stimulus package.
p352
aVWhy not a garden stimulus package?
p353
aVWhy not?
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VIn terms of other things that we need to be doing,
p358
aVwe need to move down to the local level
p359
aVand we need to make sure that gardens are legal.
p360
aVThis is an illegal garden. At least it was.
p361
aVIt's from Michigan earlier this year.
p362
aVIt was planted by a woman, a mother of four,
p363
aVand she nearly faced a 93-day jail sentence
p364
aVbecause she planted it in her front yard.
p365
aVWe still have laws from the 20th century.
p366
aVWe need to bring our codes up to the realities that we are facing now.
p367
aVWe need to figure out also new ways of getting people into gardens,
p368
aVpeople who don't have yards.
p369
aVI think we also need to set garden entrepreneurism free,
p370
aVand I'm happy to say, as a Mainer,
p371
aVthat we are leading the way in this area.
p372
aVEarlier this year, a number of Maine towns
p373
aVpassed local food sovereignty laws
p374
aVthat allow town residents to not only grow food
p375
aVwhere they want to grow it
p376
aVbut to also sell it the way they want to sell it
p377
aVand to the people they want to sell it to.
p378
aVI think that's an incentive.
p379
aVThere are a lot of gardeners out there
p380
aVthat would be interested in scaling up their production if they could,
p381
aVif they had a financial incentive.
p382
aa(lp383
VI also think that we need to examine
p384
aVthe composition of the movement right now.
p385
aa(lp386
V(Laughter)
p387
aa(lp388
VIf the movement were a 1960s beach flick,
p389
aVit would be "Where The Boys Aren't."
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
VSo I'm going to take you to task, guys.
p394
aVIt's not right and it's not fair that the burden of this responsibility \u2014
p395
aVfeeding our country and the world \u2014
p396
aVshould be with the women.
p397
aVOK?
p398
aa(lp399
V(Applause)
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd I'm going to challenge the women
p402
aVto come up with really clever, creative ways of getting guys
p403
aVinto the gardens, too.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VPerhaps wearing a bathing suit?
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VBut beyond that, I think we need to reexamine the infrastructure
p412
aVthat we have in place for gardens.
p413
aVI think we need to create new infrastructure.
p414
aVAnd this is one of the things my organization is working on right now,
p415
aVsort of a local communications infrastructure, very place-based,
p416
aVthat allows people in the same area to connect with one another
p417
aVand to help each other out.
p418
aVI think we're lacking this at the moment \u2014
p419
aa(lp420
V(Laughter)
p421
aa(lp422
Vbut we can do it.
p423
aVThe technology is certainly there.
p424
aa(lp425
VIn addition to that, I think we need another type of infrastructure.
p426
aVIt would be good if we could all get together.
p427
aVI think if we've learned anything through the TED experience,
p428
aVit's that there is power when we bring people together,
p429
aVand I think we need to bring people together at the local level as well.
p430
aVAnd I think we can take some inspiration from a previous movement,
p431
aVwhich was the grange movement,
p432
aVa rural movement which brought farmers together in a single building
p433
aVto meet and to recreate and learn how to become better farmers.
p434
aVI think we need a network
p435
aVof suburban granges now.
p436
aa(lp437
VI think one of the last things that we need
p438
aVis to not lose the fun of food.
p439
aVFood is at its best when it's delicious but shared as part of a community,
p440
aVand I think that gardens can get some of that community vibe back as well.
p441
aVSo I'm going to leave with one last video,
p442
aVand I'm going to revisit the short video that I showed you before,
p443
aVbut I'm going to suggest an alternative ending.
p444
aVAnd I think this ending is well within our reach,
p445
aVbut it's really going to require that we all pull together.
p446
aVSo here's the new history of gastronomy.
