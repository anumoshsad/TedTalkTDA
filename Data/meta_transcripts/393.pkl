VThe fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.
p4
aVIt\u2019s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,
p5
aVwhich you can find in any store in the nation.
p6
aVExcept here it\u2019s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder
p7
aVand by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,
p8
aVand I'm most grateful to them for this.
p9
aVAnd it\u2019s been split up in successive bits and a chord.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo what you\u2019re smelling now is the top note.
p12
aVAnd then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
p13
aVI will show it to you.
p14
aVThe Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe lush heart note, Melaleuca bark note \u2014 which does not contain any Melaleuca bark,
p17
aVbecause it\u2019s totally forbidden.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd after that, the complete fragrance.
p20
aVNow what you are smelling is a combination of \u2014
p21
aVI asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.
p22
aVSo I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,
p23
aVand it\u2019s about 400.
p24
aVSo what you\u2019re smelling is several hundred molecules
p25
aVfloating through the air, hitting your nose.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd do not get the impression that this is very subjective.
p28
aVYou are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?
p29
aVSmell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.
p30
aVIt\u2019s not really true.
p31
aVAnd perfumery shows you that can\u2019t be true,
p32
aVbecause if it were like that it wouldn\u2019t be an art, OK?
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, while the smell wafts over you, let me tell you the history of an idea.
p35
aVEverything that you\u2019re smelling in here
p36
aVis made up of atoms that come from what I call
p37
aVthe Upper East Side of the periodic table \u2014 a nice, safe neighborhood.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVYou really don\u2019t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.
p40
aVSome people have tried in the 1920s
p41
aVto add things from the bad parts, and it didn\u2019t really work.
p42
aa(lp43
VThese are the five atoms from which just about everything
p44
aVthat you\u2019re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.
p45
aVThe top note that you smelled at the very beginning,
p46
aVthe cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery \u2014 they\u2019re weird terms \u2014
p47
aVand this would be called a green note,
p48
aVbecause it smells of something green, like cut grass.
p49
aa(lp50
VThis is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. And I had to learn chemistry on the fly
p51
aVin the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.
p52
aVThis has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.
p53
aVIt has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,
p54
aVso it\u2019s "ol," and that\u2019s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.
p55
aVOnce you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.
p56
aa(lp57
VThis smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
p58
aVIf you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms \u2014
p59
aVthat\u2019s what it looks like when you have it on your computer \u2014
p60
aVbut actually it\u2019s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain
p61
aVsphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.
p62
aa(lp63
VOK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?
p64
aVWhy doesn\u2019t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.
p65
aVBut the first theory is: it must be the shape.
p66
aVAnd that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that
p67
aValmost everything else in biology works by shape.
p68
aVEnzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it\u2019s all, you know,
p69
aVthe fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.
p70
aVAnd I will try and explain to you what\u2019s wrong with this notion.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations.
p73
aVNow, this is a totally insane idea.
p74
aVAnd when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,
p75
aVMalcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,
p76
aVand I\u2019ll explain to you why this was the case.
p77
aVHowever, I came to realize gradually that they may be right \u2014
p78
aVand I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I\u2019m working on it.
p79
aa(lp80
VHere\u2019s how shape works in normal receptors.
p81
aVYou have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,
p82
aVand it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way
p83
aVby binding in certain parts.
p84
aVAnd the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein
p85
aVcause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, what\u2019s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide.
p88
aVThe way \u2014I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.
p89
aVThis is one page of work from a chemist\u2019s workbook, OK?
p90
aVWorking for a fragrance company.
p91
aVHe\u2019s making 45 molecules, and he\u2019s looking for a sandalwood,
p92
aVsomething that smells of sandalwood.
p93
aVBecause there\u2019s a lot of money in sandalwoods.
p94
aVAnd of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.
p95
aVAnd he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.
p96
aVThis actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,
p97
aVif you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.
p98
aVSo this is a profoundly inefficient process.
p99
aVAnd my definition of a theory is, it\u2019s not just something
p100
aVthat you teach people; it\u2019s labor saving.
p101
aVA theory is something that enables you to do less work.
p102
aVI love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why \u2014 a very simple fact
p103
aVthat tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.
p104
aa(lp105
VThis is cis-3-hexene-1-ol. It smells of cut grass.
p106
aVThis is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?
p107
aVNow, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.
p108
aVIf it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.
p109
aVThis is \u2014 in other words, we never get the O-H \u2014
p110
aVwe never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
p111
aVLike, at no concentration, even pure, you know,
p112
aVif you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn\u2019t smell of rotten eggs.
p113
aVConversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.
p114
aVIt\u2019s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.
p115
aVNow, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste
p116
aVfor biology, and he says, "That\u2019s easy! The things are a different color!"
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VWe have to go a little beyond that. Now let me explain why vibrational theory has
p120
aVsome sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,
p121
aVthe building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.
p122
aVIn fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies
p123
aVwhich are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo this is the sound of the O-H stretch, translated into the audible range.
p126
aVS-H, quite a different frequency.
p127
aVNow, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you
p128
aVthat you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:
p129
aVnothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, Fact B: nothing in the world has that frequency except S-H.
p132
aVIf you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.
p133
aVThe S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard
p134
aVthat has been, so to speak, damaged,
p135
aVand there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.
p136
aVYou have a unique smell, a unique vibration.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I went searching when I started in this game
p139
aVto convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility
p140
aVto this whole crazy story.
p141
aVI went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,
p142
aVthat would have that vibration and that \u2014 the obvious prediction
p143
aVwas that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.
p144
aVIf it didn\u2019t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, after searching high and low for several months,
p147
aVI discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane
p148
aVwhich has exactly the same vibration.
p149
aVNow the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.
p150
aVThe bad news is they\u2019re rocket fuels.
p151
aVMost of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,
p152
aVand when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVSo this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,
p155
aVand they wouldn\u2019t have liked it at my college.
p156
aa(lp157
VHowever, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.
p158
aVAnd it really does have the same \u2014 if you calculate,
p159
aVif you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature,
p162
aVthere\u2019s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone
p163
aValive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.
p164
aVAnd in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point \u2014
p165
aVmy wife is German and she translated it for me \u2014
p166
aVand at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"
p167
aVan "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.
p168
aVSo this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur
p169
aVhad been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, the slight fly in the ointment is this: that
p172
aVif we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.
p173
aVNow, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.
p174
aVAnd it\u2019s fair to say that if you look up somebody\u2019s nose,
p175
aVyou\u2019re unlikely to see anything resembling this.
p176
aVAnd this is the main objection to the theory.
p177
aa(lp178
VOK, great, we smell vibrations. How? All right?
p179
aVNow when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,
p180
aVwhich is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVThis is a joke. I\u2019m a biologist, OK?
p183
aVSo it\u2019s a joke against myself.
p184
aa(lp185
VBob Jacklovich and John Lamb at Ford Motor Company,
p186
aVin the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money
p187
aVon fundamental research, discovered a way
p188
aVto build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.
p189
aVIn other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,
p190
aVjust a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.
p191
aVNow, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,
p192
aVbut I\u2019ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here\u2019s how it works.
p193
aa(lp194
VElectrons are fuzzy creatures, and they can jump across gaps,
p195
aVbut only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can\u2019t jump.
p196
aVUnlike us, they won\u2019t fall off the cliff.
p197
aVOK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.
p198
aVSo here you have a system, you have something \u2014
p199
aVand there\u2019s plenty of that stuff in biology \u2014
p200
aVsome substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,
p201
aVand only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration
p202
aVdoes the reaction happen, OK?
p203
aVThis is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd every single part of this mechanism is actually plausible in biology.
p206
aVIn other words, I\u2019ve taken off-the-shelf components,
p207
aVand I\u2019ve made a spectroscope.
p208
aVWhat\u2019s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,
p209
aVis that then it tells you that the nose,
p210
aVthe ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.
p211
aVOf course, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it could also be that they\u2019re not.
p212
aVBut it has a certain \u2014
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aV\u2014 it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people
p215
aVwho read too much 19th-century German literature.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd then a magnificent thing happened:
p218
aVI left academia and joined the real world of business,
p219
aVand a company was created around my ideas
p220
aVto make new molecules using my method,
p221
aValong the lines of, let\u2019s put someone else\u2019s money where your mouth is.
p222
aVAnd one of the first things that happened was
p223
aVwe started going around to fragrance companies
p224
aVasking for what they needed, because, of course,
p225
aVif you could calculate smell, you don\u2019t need chemists.
p226
aVYou need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,
p227
aVOK? So you can try a thousand molecules,
p228
aVyou can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,
p229
aVand then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.
p230
aVAnd so that\u2019s a direct path to making new odorants.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd one of the first things that happened was
p233
aVwe went to see some perfumers in France \u2014
p234
aVand here\u2019s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression \u2014
p235
aVand one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."
p236
aVHe says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, coumarin is a very common thing, a material,
p239
aVin fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.
p240
aVAnd it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?
p241
aVIt\u2019s the molecule that has made men\u2019s fragrances
p242
aVsmell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd the problem is it\u2019s a carcinogen.
p245
aVSo nobody likes particularly to \u2014 you know, aftershave with carcinogens.
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVThere are some reckless people, but it\u2019s not worth it, OK?
p248
aa(lp249
VSo they asked us to make a new coumarin. And so we started doing calculations.
p250
aVAnd the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum
p251
aVof coumarin, and you smooth it out,
p252
aVso that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.
p253
aVAnd then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,
p254
aVrelated or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd we actually, in this case, I\u2019m sorry to say,
p257
aVit happened \u2014 it was serendipitous.
p258
aVBecause I got a phone call from our chief chemist
p259
aVand he said, look, I\u2019ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,
p260
aVthat even if this compound doesn\u2019t smell of coumarin,
p261
aVI want to do it, it\u2019s just such a nifty,
p262
aVone step \u2014 I mean, chemists have weird minds \u2014
p263
aVone step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely
p264
aVcrystalline compound. Let us try it.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd I said, first of all, let me do the calculation on that compound, bottom right,
p267
aVwhich is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.
p268
aVCalculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,
p269
aVthe white one is the old one.
p270
aVAnd the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.
p271
aVThey made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.
p272
aVAnd this is our new baby, called tonkene.
p273
aVYou see, when you\u2019re a scientist, you\u2019re always selling ideas.
p274
aVAnd people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.
p275
aVWhy should new ideas be accepted?
p276
aVBut when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers
p277
aVand it smells like coumarin, and it isn\u2019t coumarin,
p278
aVand you\u2019ve found it in three weeks,
p279
aVthis focuses everybody\u2019s mind wonderfully.
p280
aV(Laughter)
p281
aV(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd people often ask me, is your theory accepted?
p284
aVAnd I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know \u2014 there\u2019s three attitudes:
p285
aVYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.
p286
aVYou\u2019re right, and I don\u2019t care how you do it, in a sense;
p287
aVyou bring me the molecules, you know.
p288
aVAnd: You\u2019re completely wrong, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re completely wrong.
p289
aa(lp290
VOK? Now, we\u2019re dealing with people who only want results,
p291
aVand this is the commercial world.
p292
aVAnd they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they\u2019re happy.
p293
aVBut we\u2019re not actually doing it by astrology.
p294
aVBut for the last three years, I\u2019ve had what I consider to be
p295
aVthe best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby \u2014
p296
aVwhich is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things \u2014
p297
aVplus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry
p298
aVat the service of something that actually works.
