VI'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,
p4
aVand perhaps my faith is not very well thought of
p5
aVas being one that is grounded in compassion.
p6
aVThe truth of the matter is otherwise.
p7
aa(lp8
VOur holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,
p9
aVand each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,
p10
aVthe saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"
p11
aVor, as Sir Richard Burton \u2014
p12
aVnot the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,
p13
aVbut the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that
p14
aVand who was a worldwide traveler
p15
aVand translator of many works of literature \u2014
p16
aVtranslates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,
p19
aVGod says to his prophet Muhammad \u2014
p20
aVwhom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,
p21
aVbeginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,
p22
aVincluding Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad \u2014
p23
aVthat, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,
p24
aVexcept as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."
p25
aa(lp26
VFor us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,
p27
aVwhose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
p28
aVis to make ourselves as much like the prophet.
p29
aVAnd the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,
p30
aV"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."
p31
aVAnd because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion \u2014
p32
aVin fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"
p33
aVor, "reigned himself in by compassion" \u2014
p34
aVtherefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
p35
aVactivators of compassion, actors of compassion
p36
aVand speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.
p37
aa(lp38
VThat is all well and good,
p39
aVbut where do we go wrong,
p40
aVand what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
p41
aVFor the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.
p42
aVIn every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,
p43
aVor the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
p44
aVThe esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.
p45
aVAnd these doctors or these masters,
p46
aVthese spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,
p47
aVrefer to teachings and examples of our prophet
p48
aVthat teach us where the source of our problems lies.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn one of the battles that the prophet waged,
p51
aVhe told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war
p52
aVto the greater war, to the greater battle."
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.
p55
aVHow can we go to a greater battle?"
p56
aa(lp57
VHe said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."
p58
aVThe sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."
p59
aa(lp60
VThe famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,
p61
aVhas a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,
p62
aVand he knocks on the door,
p63
aVand a voice answers, "Who's there?"
p64
aa(lp65
V"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"
p66
aVas we might say in English.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe voice says, "Go away."
p69
aa(lp70
VAfter many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,
p71
aVhe comes back.
p72
aVWith much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.
p73
aa(lp74
VThe voice asks, "Who is there?"
p75
aa(lp76
VHe said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."
p77
aa(lp78
VThe door swings open, and the voice says,
p79
aV"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"
p80
aV\u2014 two capital I's, not these eyes \u2014 "for two egos."
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
p83
aVIn the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"
p84
aVand that is the "I" of divinity.
p85
aVIn a teaching \u2014 called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition \u2014
p86
aVGod says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,
p87
aVdoes not approach me by anything that is dearer to me
p88
aVthan what I have asked them to do."
p89
aVAnd those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
p90
aVYou want your employees to do what you ask them to do,
p91
aVand if they've done that, then they can do extra.
p92
aVBut don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
p93
aa(lp94
V"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,
p95
aVby doing more of what I've asked them to do" \u2014
p96
aVextra credit, we might call it \u2014
p97
aV"until I love him or love her.
p98
aVAnd when I love my servant," God says,
p99
aV"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,
p100
aVthe ears by which he or she listens,
p101
aVthe hand by which he or she grasps,
p102
aVand the foot by which he or she walks,
p103
aVand the heart by which he or she understands."
p104
aVIt is this merging of our self with divinity
p105
aVthat is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
p106
aa(lp107
VMuslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,
p108
aVthe greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
p109
aVWhen he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"
p110
aVand when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"
p111
aVit is because they became so much an instrument of God,
p112
aVthey became part of God's team \u2014
p113
aVso that God's will was manifest through them,
p114
aVand they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
p115
aVCompassion on earth is given, it is in us.
p116
aVAll we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,
p117
aVget our egotism out of the way.
p118
aa(lp119
VI'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,
p120
aVhave had what you might call a spiritual experience,
p121
aVa moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,
p122
aVthe boundaries of your ego dissolved.
p123
aVAnd at that minute, you felt at one with the universe \u2014
p124
aVone with that jug of water, one with every human being,
p125
aVone with the Creator \u2014
p126
aVand you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,
p127
aVof the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy
p128
aVthat you have ever experienced in your lives.
p129
aa(lp130
VThat is a moment which is a gift of God to us \u2014
p131
aVa gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary
p132
aVwhich makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"
p133
aVand instead, like the person in Rumi's story,
p134
aVwe say, "Oh, this is all you.
p135
aVThis is all you. And this is all us.
p136
aVAnd us, and I, and us are all part of you.
p137
aVO, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being
p138
aVand the end of our journey,
p139
aVyou are also the breaker of our hearts.
p140
aVYou are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,
p141
aVand for whose purpose we shall die,
p142
aVand for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
p143
aVto account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."
p144
aa(lp145
VOur message today, and our purpose today,
p146
aVand those of you who are here today,
p147
aVand the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
p148
aVFor the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,
p149
aVbecause the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
p150
aa(lp151
VWe know it all.
p152
aVWe have access to it all.
p153
aVJung may have called it "the subconscious."
p154
aVThrough our subconscious, in your dreams \u2014
p155
aVthe Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"
p156
aV"the temporary death" \u2014
p157
aVin our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,
p158
aVwe travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,
p159
aVand we see wonderful things.
p160
aVWe travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,
p161
aVand beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
p162
aVBut all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator
p163
aVwhose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
p164
aa(lp165
VGod, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,
p166
aVwhatever the name might be through which you name
p167
aVor access the presence of divinity,
p168
aVit is the locus of absolute being,
p169
aVabsolute love and mercy and compassion,
p170
aVand absolute knowledge and wisdom,
p171
aVwhat Hindus call "satchidananda."
p172
aVThe language differs,
p173
aVbut the objective is the same.
p174
aa(lp175
VRumi has another story
p176
aVabout three men, a Turk, an Arab and \u2014
p177
aVand I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
p178
aVOne is asking for angur \u2014 one is, say, an Englishman \u2014
p179
aVone is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
p180
aVAnd they have a fight and an argument because
p181
aV\u2014 "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." \u2014
p182
aVnot knowing that the word that they're using
p183
aVrefers to the same reality in different languages.
p184
aa(lp185
VThere's only one absolute reality by definition,
p186
aVone absolute being by definition,
p187
aVbecause absolute is, by definition, single,
p188
aVand absolute and singular.
p189
aVThere's this absolute concentration of being,
p190
aVthe absolute concentration of consciousness,
p191
aVawareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love
p192
aVthat defines the primary attributes of divinity.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd these should also be
p195
aVthe primary attributes of what it means to be human.
p196
aVFor what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,
p197
aVis our physiology,
p198
aVbut God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,
p201
aV"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,
p202
aVand breathed into him of my spirit,
p203
aVthen, fall in prostration to him."
p204
aVThe angels prostrate, not before the human body,
p205
aVbut before the human soul.
p206
aVWhy? Because the soul, the human soul,
p207
aVembodies a piece of the divine breath,
p208
aVa piece of the divine soul.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis is also expressed in biblical vocabulary
p211
aVwhen we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
p212
aVWhat is the imagery of God?
p213
aVThe imagery of God is absolute being,
p214
aVabsolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom
p215
aVand absolute compassion and love.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd therefore, for us to be human \u2014
p218
aVin the greatest sense of what it means to be human,
p219
aVin the most joyful sense of what it means to be human \u2014
p220
aVmeans that we too have to be proper stewards
p221
aVof the breath of divinity within us,
p222
aVand seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,
p223
aVof being alive, of beingness;
p224
aVthe attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;
p225
aVand the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.
p226
aa(lp227
VThis is what I understand from my faith tradition,
p228
aVand this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,
p229
aVand this is the common platform on which we must all stand,
p230
aVand when we stand on this platform as such,
p231
aVI am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd I believe, personally, that we're on the verge
p234
aVand that, with the presence and help of people like you here,
p235
aVwe can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
p236
aVFor he foretold of a period
p237
aVwhen people shall transform their swords into plowshares
p238
aVand will not learn war or make war anymore.
p239
aa(lp240
VWe have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:
p241
aVwe must, we must lower our egos,
p242
aVcontrol our egos \u2014 whether it is individual ego, personal ego,
p243
aVfamily ego, national ego \u2014
p244
aVand let all be for the glorification of the one.
