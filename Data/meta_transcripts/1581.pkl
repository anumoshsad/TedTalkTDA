VTo understand the world that live in, we tell stories.
p4
aVAnd while remixing and sharing have come to define
p5
aVthe web as we know it,
p6
aVall of us can now be part of that story through simple tools
p7
aVthat allow us to make things online.
p8
aVBut video has been left out. It arrived on the web
p9
aVin a small box, and there it has remained,
p10
aVcompletely disconnected from the data and the content
p11
aVall around it.
p12
aVIn fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing
p13
aVthat has changed about video is the size of the box
p14
aVand the quality of the picture.
p15
aa(lp16
VPopcorn changes all of that.
p17
aVIt's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video
p18
aVwith content pulled live directly from the web.
p19
aVVideos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself:
p20
aVdynamic, full of links, and completely remixable,
p21
aVand finally allowed to break free from the frame.
p22
aa(lp23
VI want to give you a demo of a prototype
p24
aVthat we're working on that we'll launch later this fall.
p25
aVIt will be completely free, and it will work in any browser.
p26
aVSo, every Popcorn production begins with the video,
p27
aVand so I've made a short, 20-second clip
p28
aVusing a newscaster template that we use in workshops.
p29
aVSo let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it.
p30
aa(lp31
VHi, and welcome to my newscast.
p32
aVI've added my location with a Google Map,
p33
aVand it's live, so try moving it around.
p34
aVYou can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons,
p35
aVor pull in content from any web service, like Flickr,
p36
aVor add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there.
p39
aVSo this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video,
p40
aVyou're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline,
p41
aVwhat you're looking at is web events pulled into the video.
p42
aVNow in this Popcorn production we've got
p43
aVthe title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up
p44
aVpicture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push
p45
aVoutside the frame and take over the whole screen.
p46
aVThere are two pop-ups bringing you some other information,
p47
aVand a final article with a link out to the original article.
p48
aa(lp49
VLet's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.
p50
aVAll you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item,
p51
aVand I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.
p52
aVLet's set it to something else.
p53
aVPopcorn immediately goes out onto the web,
p54
aVtalks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.
p55
aVAnd it's exactly the same
p56
aVfor the people who watch your production.
p57
aVAnd it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it,
p58
aVyou zoom in, right down to street view if you want to.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed,
p61
aVwhich we can do right now, so let's add a live feed
p62
aVfrom Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side,
p63
aVgrab Flickr from the list of options,
p64
aVdrag it into the timeline,
p65
aVand put it where you'd like it to go,
p66
aVand it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in
p67
aVimages based on the tags. Now, my developers
p68
aVreally like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag.
p69
aVLet's try something else,
p70
aVmaybe something a bit more relevant to today.
p71
aVNow here are live images being pulled straight from the feed.
p72
aVIf you come and watch this a week from now,
p73
aVthis will be completely different,
p74
aVdynamic, just like the web, and just like the web,
p75
aVeverything is sourced, so click your link,
p76
aVand you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.
p77
aa(lp78
VEverything you've seen today is built with the basic
p79
aVbuilding blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
p80
aVThat means it's completely remixable. It also means
p81
aVthere's no proprietary software. All you need
p82
aVis a web browser.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo imagine if every video that we watched on the web
p85
aVworked like the web, completely remixable,
p86
aVlinked to its source content, and interactive
p87
aVfor everyone who views it.
p88
aVI think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on
p89
aVthe web, and the way we understand the world we live in.
p90
aVThank you. (Applause)
