VI was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,
p4
aVand it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.
p5
aVWe like to dance together, we like singing together.
p6
aVAnd so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help
p7
aVwith a first experiment today. The experiment is \u2014
p8
aVand I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,
p9
aVthat you did it in a typical North American way,
p10
aVthat is, you were raucous and incoherent.
p11
aVYou were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.
p12
aVDo you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would \u2014
p13
aVno, you haven't practiced, as far as I know \u2014
p14
aVcan you get it together to clap in sync?
p15
aa(lp16
V(Clapping)
p17
aa(lp18
VWhoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I didn't expect that, but \u2014 I mean, I expected you could synchronize.
p23
aVIt didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.
p24
aVIt's interesting.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VSo what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.
p29
aVThis is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.
p30
aVSome trained musicians out there.
p31
aVIs that what enabled you to synchronize?
p32
aVSo to put the question a little more seriously,
p33
aVlet's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,
p34
aVfor spontaneous synchronization.
p35
aVDo you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?
p36
aVDo you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?
p37
aVDo you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?
p38
aVInanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
p39
aVIt's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,
p40
aVif not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
p41
aVIt extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
p42
aVIt's a deep tendency toward order in nature
p43
aVthat opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.
p44
aVI mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong \u2014 it's not.
p45
aVBut there is a countervailing force in the universe \u2014
p46
aVthe tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately
p49
aVwhen you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,
p50
aVwhich is the glorious example of birds that flock together,
p51
aVor fish swimming in organized schools.
p52
aVSo these are not particularly intelligent creatures,
p53
aVand yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.
p54
aVThis is from a BBC show called "Predators,"
p55
aVand what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
p56
aVWhen you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,
p57
aVor like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
p58
aVLet me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
p59
aVFor a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,
p60
aVwondering how it could be possible.
p61
aVWe're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.
p62
aVThese creatures are not choreographed.
p63
aVThey're choreographing themselves.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd only today is science starting to figure out how it works.
p66
aVI'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,
p67
aVthat shows how swarms work.
p68
aVThere are just three simple rules.
p69
aVFirst, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.
p70
aVSecond, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.
p71
aVAnd third, they're all attracted to each other,
p72
aVbut they try to keep a small distance apart.
p73
aVAnd when you build those three rules in,
p74
aVautomatically you start to see swarms
p75
aVthat look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.
p76
aVNow, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.
p77
aVBirds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.
p78
aVBut except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.
p81
aVThere's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.
p82
aVHere on the model you see the predator attacking.
p83
aVThe prey move out in random directions,
p84
aVand then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,
p85
aVso there's this constant splitting and reforming.
p86
aVAnd you see that in nature.
p87
aVKeep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,
p88
aVwhat's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.
p89
aVEach is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.
p90
aVThat is, out of the desire to save itself,
p91
aVeach creature is following these rules,
p92
aVand that leads to something that's safe for all of them.
p93
aVEven though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.
p94
aVYou might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,
p95
aVso you can think of several.
p96
aa(lp97
VAs I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one
p98
aVare reduced as compared to a small group.
p99
aVThere are many eyes to spot danger.
p100
aVAnd you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,
p101
aVwhen this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,
p102
aVthat actually waves of panic can propagate,
p103
aVsending messages over great distances.
p104
aVYou'll see \u2014 let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end \u2014 maybe not.
p105
aVInformation can be sent over half a kilometer away
p106
aVin a very short time through this mechanism.
p107
aVYes, it's happening here.
p108
aVSee if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.
p109
aVIt's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,
p110
aVfrom that computer model, what's going on.
p111
aVAs I say, it's just those three simple rules,
p112
aVplus the one about watch out for predators.
p113
aa(lp114
VThere doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.
p115
aVWe don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.
p116
aVI'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.
p117
aVI mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.
p118
aVA computer is, in a way, just another experiment.
p119
aVWe would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works
p120
aVand to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.
p121
aVHow do the rules give rise to the patterns?
p122
aa(lp123
VThere is one case that we have begun to understand better,
p124
aVand it's the case of fireflies.
p125
aVIf you see fireflies in North America,
p126
aVlike so many North American sorts of things,
p127
aVthey tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.
p128
aVThey each do their own thing, flashing on and off,
p129
aVpaying no attention to their neighbors.
p130
aVBut in Southeast Asia \u2014 places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo \u2014
p131
aVthere's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.
p132
aVYou can see it every night along the river banks.
p133
aVThe trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.
p134
aVSpecifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,
p135
aVin perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.
p136
aVAnd the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."
p137
aa(lp138
V(Music)
p139
aa(lp140
VIn a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly
p141
aVso that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.
p142
aVThen on, and then off \u2014 a 30th of a second, there.
p143
aVAnd then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.
p144
aVOn, more on and then off.
p145
aVThe combined light from these beetles \u2014 these are actually tiny beetles \u2014
p146
aVis so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them
p147
aVas navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.
p148
aVFor a long time it was not believed
p149
aVwhen the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,
p150
aVwent to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.
p151
aVNo one believed them.
p152
aVWe don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
p153
aVAnd for a long time, even after it was documented,
p154
aVit was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
p155
aVScientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids
p156
aVthat explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency
p157
aVto see patterns where there are none.
p158
aVBut I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,
p159
aVthat they really were very well synchronized.
p160
aa(lp161
VOkay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive
p162
aVto see this kind of spontaneous order,
p163
aVand I've already hinted that the answer is no.
p164
aVWell, you don't have to be a whole creature.
p165
aVYou can even be just a single cell.
p166
aVLike, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.
p167
aVThey're keeping you alive.
p168
aVEvery beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,
p169
aVwhich has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,
p170
aVhave an electrical rhythm \u2014 a voltage up and down \u2014
p171
aVto send a signal to the ventricles to pump.
p172
aVNow, your pacemaker is not a single cell.
p173
aVIt's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison
p174
aVfor the pacemaker to work correctly.
p175
aa(lp176
VI don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.
p177
aVIf you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,
p178
aVdischarging in pathological concert.
p179
aVSo this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.
p180
aVYou don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.
p181
aVIf you look, for instance, at how lasers work,
p182
aVthat would be a case of atomic synchrony.
p183
aVIn a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here
p184
aVis that this light is incoherent \u2014
p185
aVmany different colors and different frequencies,
p186
aVsort of like the way you clapped initially \u2014
p187
aVbut if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.
p188
aVIt would be all atoms pulsating in unison,
p189
aVemitting light of one color, one frequency.
p190
aa(lp191
VNow comes the very risky part of my talk,
p192
aVwhich is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.
p193
aVHold your breath for me.
p194
aVWhat I have here are two empty water bottles.
p195
aVThis is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.
p196
aVThis is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.
p197
aVI have some metronomes here.
p198
aVCan you hear that?
p199
aVAll right, so, I've got a metronome,
p200
aVand it's the world's smallest metronome, the \u2014 well, I shouldn't advertise.
p201
aVAnyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.
p202
aVI've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take
p203
aVanother one set to the same setting.
p204
aVWe can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,
p205
aVthere's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.
p206
aa(lp207
VMaybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.
p208
aVWhat I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart
p209
aVbecause their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.
p210
aVRight? They did.
p211
aVThey were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.
p212
aVAnd the reason is that they're not able to communicate.
p213
aVNow, you might think that's a bizarre idea.
p214
aVHow can metronomes communicate?
p215
aVWell, they can communicate through mechanical forces.
p216
aVSo I'm going to give them a chance to do that.
p217
aVI also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?
p218
aVI'm going to put them on a movable platform,
p219
aVwhich is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.
p220
aVLet's see if we can get this to work.
p221
aVMy wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time
p222
aVbecause otherwise the whole thing will tip over.
p223
aVAll right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat \u2014
p224
aVlet me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VAll right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aVNow, that might seem a bit whimsical,
p232
aVbut this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
p233
aVsometimes has unexpected consequences.
p234
aVAnd a clear case of that,
p235
aVwas something that happened in London in the year 2000.
p236
aVThe Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London \u2014
p237
aVa beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,
p238
aVfirst river crossing in over 100 years in London.
p239
aVThere was a big competition for the design of this bridge,
p240
aVand the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team \u2014
p241
aVin the TED spirit, actually \u2014 of an architect \u2014
p242
aVperhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster \u2014
p243
aVworking with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,
p244
aVand an engineering firm, Ove Arup.
p245
aVAnd together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,
p246
aVwhich was \u2014 he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,
p247
aVand he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,
p248
aVhe would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.
p249
aa(lp250
VHe would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,
p251
aVand then scamper across on this blade of light.
p252
aVHe said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.
p253
aVI want a blade of light across the Thames."
p254
aVSo they built the blade of light,
p255
aVand it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's \u2014
p256
aVprobably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,
p257
aVwith cables that are out on the side.
p258
aVYou're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
p259
aVThese cables were on the side of the bridge,
p260
aVlike if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames \u2014
p261
aVthat's what's holding up this bridge.
p262
aVNow, everyone was very excited to try it out.
p263
aVOn opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.
p264
aVAnd within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
p265
aVSo I want to first show you some interviews with people
p266
aVwho were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.
p267
aa(lp268
VMan: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,
p269
aVrather like being on the boat.
p270
aa(lp271
VWoman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,
p272
aVand I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely \u2014
p273
aVthere was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.
p274
aa(lp275
VInterviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.
p276
aa(lp277
VInterviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.
p278
aa(lp279
VInterviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?
p280
aa(lp281
VBoy: It was about \u2014
p282
aa(lp283
VInterviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?
p284
aa(lp285
VBoy: About the second one.
p286
aa(lp287
VInterviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.
p288
aa(lp289
VMan: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.
p290
aa(lp291
VInterviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.
p292
aa(lp293
VWoman: I remember wanting to get off.
p294
aa(lp295
VInterviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.
p296
aa(lp297
VInterviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.
p298
aa(lp299
VInterviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?
p300
aa(lp301
VBoy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance
p302
aVbecause if you didn't keep your balance,
p303
aVthen you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.
p304
aVInterviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.
p305
aVAnd then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.
p306
aVSo you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and \u2014
p307
aVoh, and short steps?
p308
aa(lp309
VMan: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me
p310
aVthat it was probably the number of people on it.
p311
aa(lp312
VInterviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?
p313
aa(lp314
VMan: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.
p315
aa(lp316
VSteven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.
p317
aVThink of the bridge as being like this platform.
p318
aVThink of the people as being like metronomes.
p319
aVNow, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,
p320
aVbut after all, we do walk like \u2014 I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.
p321
aVAnd especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?
p322
aVThey all showed this strange sort of skating gait
p323
aVthat they adopted once the bridge started to move.
p324
aVAnd so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.
p325
aVBut also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip
p326
aVof work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,
p327
aVwho figured out what happened on the bridge,
p328
aVand who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.
p329
aVIt was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop
p330
aVbetween the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,
p331
aVthat engineers knew nothing about.
p332
aVActually, I think the first person you'll see
p333
aVis the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.
p334
aa(lp335
V(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.
p336
aa(lp337
VInterviewer: Right. So it was quite small \u2014 Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: \u2014 but real?
p338
aa(lp339
VEngineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."
p340
aa(lp341
VEngineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.
p342
aa(lp343
VWe'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,
p344
aVwe'd checked it to codes \u2014 to heavier loads than the codes \u2014
p345
aVand here it was doing something that we didn't know about.
p346
aVInterviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.
p347
aa(lp348
VNarrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage
p349
aVshows whole sections of the crowd \u2014 hundreds of people \u2014
p350
aVapparently rocking from side to side in unison,
p351
aVnot only with each other, but with the bridge.
p352
aVThis synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.
p353
aVBut how could the crowd become synchronized?
p354
aVWas there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?
p355
aVThis was to be the focus of the investigation.
p356
aa(lp357
VInterviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.
p358
aVNow, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.
p359
aa(lp360
VInterviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,
p361
aVand this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?
p362
aa(lp363
VAM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.
p364
aa(lp365
VInterviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?
p366
aa(lp367
VAllan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,
p368
aVsuggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble
p369
aVin the same way as the real bridge \u2014
p370
aVprovided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.
p371
aa(lp372
VAM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.
p373
aVJust by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.
p374
aa(lp375
VAM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.
p376
aa(lp377
VInterviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.
p378
aVYou have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,
p379
aVbecause if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.
p380
aa(lp381
VAM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.
p382
aa(lp383
VInterviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,
p384
aVit's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.
p385
aa(lp386
VInterviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.
p387
aVSo already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way
p388
aVas our witnesses walked on the real bridge.
p389
aa(lp390
VAM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.
p391
aa(lp392
VInterviewer: For a more convincing experiment,
p393
aVI wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.
p394
aVTheir instructions: just walk normally.
p395
aVIt's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.
p396
aVThey're all having some difficulty walking.
p397
aVAnd the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
p398
aVBut then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
p399
aVYou can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,
p400
aVand therefore to drive it to move further.
p401
aa(lp402
VSS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,
p403
aVmaybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.
