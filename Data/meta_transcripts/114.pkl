VI just want to say, over the last few years I've been \u2014
p4
aVhad the opportunity to do this closing conference.
p5
aVAnd I've had some incredible warm-up acts.
p6
aVAbout eight years ago,
p7
aVBilly Graham opened for me.
p8
aVAnd I thought that there was \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI thought that there was absolutely no way
p13
aVin hell to top that.
p14
aVBut I just wanted to say \u2014
p15
aVand I mean this without irony \u2014
p16
aVI think I can speak for everybody in the audience
p17
aVwhen I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VOK, this is the title of my talk today.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VI just want to give you a quick overview.
p26
aVFirst of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,
p27
aVand I mean everything with great affection.
p28
aVIf any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,
p29
aVnow is the time to check your Blackberry.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VJust to review, this is my TEDTalk.
p34
aVWe're going to do some jokes,
p35
aVsome gags,
p36
aVsome little skits \u2014
p37
aVand then we're going to talk about the L1 point.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo, one of the questions I ask myself
p42
aVis, was this the most distressing TED ever?
p43
aVLet's try and sum things up, shall we?
p44
aVImages of limb regeneration
p45
aVand faces filled with smallpox:
p46
aV21 percent of the conference.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VMentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.
p51
aVImages of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd David Pogue singing show tunes.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Applause)
p58
aa(lp59
VBecause this is the most distressing TED ever,
p60
aVI've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.
p61
aVAnd if the \u2014 if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,
p62
aVthen we're going to have a scream bag next year.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VIt's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VSo you're going to be able to go like this.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VBring it over here
p75
aVand open it up. Aaaah!
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VMeanwhile, back at TED University,
p80
aVthis wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aVSo Robert Wright \u2014 I don't know,
p84
aa(lp85
VI felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,
p86
aVit might have been him.
p87
aVI want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VHe was talking about morality.
p92
aVEconomy class morality is,
p93
aVwe want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.
p94
aVBusiness class morality is,
p95
aVdon't bomb Japan \u2014 they built my car.
p96
aVAnd first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico \u2014 they clean my house.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VYes, it is politically incorrect.
p101
aVAll right,
p102
aVnow I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ...
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VAll right, now these are the wha \u2014
p107
aVI'd say, [mumble, mumble \u2014
p108
aVmumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,
p109
aVmumble] \u2014 ahh!
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VSo I wanted to show you guys \u2014
p114
aVI wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface
p115
aVthat lets you work with images just as easily
p116
aVas you \u2014 as a completely natural user interface.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd you can \u2014
p121
aVyou can use really natural hand gestures
p122
aVto like, go like this.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VNow we had a Harvard professor here \u2014
p127
aVshe was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and \u2014
p128
aVand she was actually a professor from Harvard.
p129
aVAnd she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.
p130
aVWith, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.
p131
aVThere's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,
p132
aVwhich is too \u2014 too \u2014 absolutely too weak to understand
p133
aVwhat the fuck she was talking about.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VNow \u2014
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
Vone of the things that is very important to me
p142
aVis to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.
p143
aVAnd that's why I went out
p144
aVand I picked up a best-selling business book.
p145
aVYou know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.
p146
aVAnd it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,
p147
aVand it's called
p148
aV"The Porpoise Driven Life."
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd Rick is as
p153
aVa pagan god,
p154
aVwhich I thought was kind of appropriate,
p155
aVin a certain way.
p156
aVAnd now we're going to have kind of
p157
aVa little more visualization about Rick Warren.
p158
aVOK.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAll right.
p163
aVNow, red is Rick Warren,
p164
aVand green is Daniel Dennett, OK?
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThe scales here are religiosity from zero percent,
p169
aVor atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.
p170
aVAnd then this is books sold \u2014 the logarithmic scale.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
V30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million.
p175
aVOK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.
p180
aVYup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VBut Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.
p185
aVLet me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
V(Applause)
p190
aa(lp191
VNow, one of the things that's very important is,
p192
aVNicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per \u2014
p193
aVI'm sorry \u2014
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
Vabout One Laptop Per Child.
p198
aVNow let's talk about some of the characteristics
p199
aVthat are important for this revolutionary device.
p200
aVI'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,
p201
aVand then I'll show it to you in person.
p202
aVFirst of all, it needs to be small.
p203
aVIt needs to be flat, so it's transportable.
p204
aVLightweight. Portable.
p205
aVUses very, very little power.
p206
aVVery, very high resolution.
p207
aVHas to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.
p208
aVAnd broadly applicable across many platforms.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, we've actually done some research \u2014
p211
aVNeil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.
p212
aVThey did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype
p213
aVof what the students in the field are actually asking for.
p214
aVAnd here it is,
p215
aVthe $100 computer.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VOK, OK, OK, OK \u2014 excellent, excellent.
p220
aVNow, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.
p221
aVAnd he and his team of junior-high school students
p222
aVwere doing real science.
p223
aVSo we're trying to check and trying to douse here,
p224
aVand see who uses marijuana.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VSee who uses marijuana.
p229
aVAre we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?
p230
aVOnly if we open enough locker doors.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VOK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.
p235
aVWe had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.
p236
aVI wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.
p237
aVWe start. This is day one.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Laughter)
p240
aa(lp241
VDay two.
p242
aVDay three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.
p243
aVDay three.
p244
aVDay four.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VDay five
p249
aVand day six.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
VNow the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,
p254
aVI know that even though she'll be scarred for life,
p255
aVshe's going to make a full recovery.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
VNow the good news about Architects for Humanity
p260
aVis they're really kind of the most amazing group.
p261
aVThey've been sponsoring a design competition
p262
aVto come up with innovative medical housing solutions,
p263
aVclinic solutions, in Africa,
p264
aVand they've had a design competition.
p265
aVNow the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed
p266
aVthe head of the Google Foundation,
p267
aVand so he decided that he would support \u2014
p268
aVhe would support Cameron's work.
p269
aVAnd the way he decided to support that work
p270
aVwas by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers
p271
aVof Google snacks.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VSo I want to show you some prototypes.
p276
aVThe U.N. \u2014 you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,
p277
aVbut I think we have some more exciting things.
p278
aVThis is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.
p285
aVAnd the really wonderful thing about this is,
p286
aVwhen you're done, well \u2014
p287
aVyou can eat it.
p288
aVBut the thing that I'm really, really excited about
p289
aVis this incredible granola house.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Laughter)
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof
p294
aVto collect water and recycle it.
p295
aVAnd it's \u2014 well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids
p296
aVand Gummy Bears to let in the light.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VBut on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,
p301
aVto diffuse the light more slightly.
p302
aVAnd we \u2014 we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, Einstein \u2014
p309
aVEinstein, tell me \u2014
p310
aVwhat's your favorite song?
p311
aVNo, I said what's your favorite song?
p312
aVNo, I said what's your favorite song?
p313
aV"Free Bird."
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
V(Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VOK, so, Einstein,
p320
aVwhat's your favorite singing group?
p321
aVCould you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?
p322
aVOK, one more time \u2014 I'm just going to give you a little help.
p323
aVYour favorite singing group \u2014 it's Diana Ross and the \u2014
p324
aa(lp325
VAudience: Supremes!
p326
aa(lp327
VTom Reilly: Exactly.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Applause)
p330
aa(lp331
VCould we have the sound up on the laptop, please?
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
V"Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you \u2014
p336
aVif you listen to "Free Bird" backwards,
p337
aVthis is what you might hear.
p338
aa(lp339
VComputer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.
p340
aVSatan. Satan. Satan.
p341
aVTR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to \u2014
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
Vso I wanted to help you a little bit.
p346
aa(lp347
VComputer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.
p348
aVBuy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VTR: So,
p353
aVwe've talked a lot about global warming,
p354
aVbut, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice \u2014
p355
aVgood weather in the wintertime, and New York City.
p356
aVAnd as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.
p357
aVSo Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.
p358
aVSo I've tried to figure out a good design process
p359
aVto come up with a new term to replace "global warming."
p360
aa(lp361
VSo we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.
p362
aVAnd then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch \u2014
p363
aVinto "Het globale Verwarmen."
p364
aVFrom Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
V[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.
p369
aVThen Portuguese to Pig Latin.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Laughter)
p372
aa(lp373
VAquecer-se ucked-fay.
p374
aVAnd then finally back into the English,
p375
aVwhich is, we're totally fucked.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VNow I don't know about you,
p382
aVbut Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings \u2014
p383
aVevolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.
p384
aVFor example, in cheese sandwiches.
p385
aVNow can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?
p386
aVI tried to make it a little bit clearer.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Laughter)
p389
aa(lp390
VIs it the Virgin Mary?
p391
aVOr is it Mena Trott?
p392
aa(lp393
VSo, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center
p394
aVand the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
p395
aVIt's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
p396
aVSo we tried to come up with a program \u2014
p397
aVhow we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.
p398
aVSo first of all we decided \u2014
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
Vthat we needed about one-third bookstore,
p403
aVone-third Google cafe,
p404
aVabout 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,
p405
aVabout five percent for restrooms.
p406
aVAnd then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,
p407
aVthe lobby and the Steinbeck forum.
p408
aa(lp409
VNow let me show you how that
p410
aVliterally translated into the design program.
p411
aVSo first,
p412
aVone of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming
p413
aVand Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level
p414
aVis going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.
p415
aVSo we're going to build this new building on stilts.
p416
aVSo we build this building on stilts,
p417
aVthen up here \u2014
p418
aa(lp419
V(Laughter)
p420
aa(lp421
Vis where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Laughter)
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,
p426
aVit's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.
p427
aa(lp428
V(Laughter)
p429
aa(lp430
VThen we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.
p431
aVAnd finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel
p432
aVand the Portola Plaza on the top.
p433
aa(lp434
V(Applause)
p435
aa(lp436
VNow I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head
p437
aVof separated at birth.
p438
aVI don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,
p439
aVI immediately go to Gandalf the Grey.
p440
aa(lp441
V(Laughter)
p442
aa(lp443
VOK. Now, we've heard, of course,
p444
aVthat we're all soldiers here.
p445
aVSo what I'd really, really like you to do now is,
p446
aVpick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?
p447
aVAnd I want you to get out a pen,
p448
aVand I want you to write a terrorist note.
p449
aa(lp450
V(Laughter)
p451
aa(lp452
VIf we put up the ELMO for a moment \u2014
p453
aVif we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,
p454
aVI'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?
p455
aa(lp456
V(Laughter)
p457
aa(lp458
VAnd then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.
p459
aVAnd once you've folded it into a paper airplane,
p460
aVI want you to take some anthrax \u2014
p461
aa(lp462
V(Laughter)
p463
aa(lp464
Vand I want you to put that in the paper airplane.
p465
aVAnd then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Laughter)
p468
aa(lp469
VLuckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.
p470
aVAnd I wanted to see \u2014
p471
aVI want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.
p472
aVOK.
p473
aa(lp474
VNow this film isn't really hard enough,
p475
aVso I wanted to make it a little bit harder.
p476
aVSo I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.
p477
aa(lp478
V(Laughter)
p479
aa(lp480

p488
aa(lp489

p490
aa(lp491
VCan we cue the music please?
p492
aa(lp493
V(Applause)
p494
aa(lp495
VNow I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.
p496
aVBack in 1968,
p497
aVyou can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain
p498
aVwas covered in 151 inches of snow pack.
p499
aVParenthetically, over there on the slopes,
p500
aVI did want to show you that black men ski.
p501
aa(lp502
V(Laughter)
p503
aa(lp504
VBut over the years,
p505
aV10 years later, the snow packs eroded,
p506
aVand, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.
p507
aVThe water level of the lake has started drying up.
p508
aVA few years later, there's no snow left at all.
p509
aVAnd all the trees have turned brown.
p510
aVThis year, unfortunately the lakebed's
p511
aVturned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
p512
aVAnd I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,
p513
aVin 20 years, it's going to look like this.
p514
aa(lp515
V(Laughter)
p516
aa(lp517
VMr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.
p518
aa(lp519
V(Laughter)
p520
aa(lp521
V(Applause)
p522
aa(lp523
VThank you very much.
