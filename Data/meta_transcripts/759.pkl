VWhen my brother called me in December of 1998,
p4
aVhe said, "The news does not look good."
p5
aVThis is him on the screen.
p6
aVHe'd just been diagnosed with ALS,
p7
aVwhich is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
p8
aVIt paralyzes you. It starts by killing
p9
aVthe motor neurons in your spinal cord.
p10
aVAnd you go from being a healthy,
p11
aVrobust 29-year-old male
p12
aVto someone that cannot breathe,
p13
aVcannot move, cannot speak.
p14
aa(lp15
VThis has actually been, to me, a gift,
p16
aVbecause we began a journey
p17
aVto learn a new way of thinking about life.
p18
aVAnd even though Steven passed away three years ago
p19
aVwe had an amazing journey as a family.
p20
aVWe did not even \u2014
p21
aVI think adversity is not even the right word.
p22
aVWe looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this
p23
aVin an incredibly positive way."
p24
aVAnd I want to talk today
p25
aVabout one of the things that we decided to do,
p26
aVwhich was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.
p27
aVBecause, as we all know here today,
p28
aVit doesn't work very well.
p29
aVI want to talk about it in the context of a story.
p30
aa(lp31
VThis is the story of my brother.
p32
aVBut it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,
p33
aVand go to something more.
p34
aV"Given my status, what is the best outcome
p35
aVI can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
p36
aVis what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.
p37
aVAnd those questions all have variables to them.
p38
aVAll of our statuses are different.
p39
aVAll of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,
p40
aVis different, and our paths will be different,
p41
aVthey are all stories.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut it's a story until we convert it to data
p44
aVand so what we do, this concept we had,
p45
aVwas to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"
p46
aVand go from this concept of walking, breathing,
p47
aVand then his hands, speak,
p48
aVand ultimately happiness and function.
p49
aVSo, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man
p50
aVon his icon,
p51
aVbut the rest of them are really what's important here.
p52
aVBecause Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,
p53
aVas he was in that pool, he could not walk,
p54
aVhe could not use his arms \u2014 that's why he had the little floaty things on them,
p55
aVdid you see those? \u2014
p56
aVhe was happy. We were at the beach,
p57
aVhe was raising his son, and he was productive.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd we took this, and we converted it into data.
p60
aVBut it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
p61
aVIt is a data point of Steven in a context.
p62
aVHere he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,
p63
aVas a builder: taller, stronger,
p64
aVgot all the women, amazing guy.
p65
aVHere he is walking down the aisle,
p66
aVbut he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.
p67
aVAnd he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,
p68
aVcan't feed himself.
p69
aVAnd here he is, paralyzed completely,
p70
aVunable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
p71
aVThese stories of his life, converted to data.
p72
aVHe renovated my carriage house
p73
aVwhen he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,
p74
aVand unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.
p77
aVAnd this is the insight, the thing that we are
p78
aVexcited about,
p79
aVbecause we have gone away from the community that we are,
p80
aVthe fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
p81
aVWe need to give to others to be successful.
p82
aVSo, Steven is sharing this story,
p83
aVbut he is not alone.
p84
aVThere are so many other people sharing their stories.
p85
aVNot stories in words, but stories in data and words.
p86
aVAnd we convert that information into this structure,
p87
aVthis understanding, this ability to convert
p88
aVthose stories into something that is computable,
p89
aVto which we can begin to change the way
p90
aVmedicine is done and delivered.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,
p93
aVParkinson's disease, HIV.
p94
aVThese are not simple, they are not internet scalable;
p95
aVthey require thought and processes
p96
aVto find the meaningful information about the disease.
p97
aVSo, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.
p98
aVAnd I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,
p99
aVthe company that myself, my youngest brother
p100
aVand a good friend from MIT started.
p101
aa(lp102
VHere are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,
p103
aVsharing their stories as data.
p104
aVHere is an M.S. patient.
p105
aVHis name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired
p106
aVon cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
p107
aVThose are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
p108
aVEach of them can have a different characteristic.
p109
aVYou can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.
p110
aVLook at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.
p111
aVIt's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.
p112
aVBut he is working to keep his CD4 count high
p113
aVand his viral level low so he can make his life better.
p114
aa(lp115
VBut you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.
p116
aVLook at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.
p117
aVThese are patients currently on drugs,
p118
aVsharing data.
p119
aVI love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
p120
aVAnyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study
p121
aVon prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.
p122
aVWhat I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.
p123
aVThese are why people pray.
p124
aVHere is the schedule of how frequently they \u2014 it's a dose.
p125
aVSo, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,
p126
aVand see if they're doing better, they probably are.
p127
aVHere they are. It's an open network,
p128
aVeverybody is sharing. We can see it all.
p129
aa(lp130
VOr, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.
p131
aVAnd here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.
p132
aVHow they treat it,
p133
aVthe drugs, the components of it,
p134
aVtheir side effects, all of it in a rich environment,
p135
aVand you can drill down and see the individuals.
p136
aVThis amazing data allows us to drill down and see
p137
aVwhat this drug is for \u2014
p138
aV1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.
p139
aVI want to talk to the 58 patients down here
p140
aVwho are taking four milligrams a day.
p141
aVAnd I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing
p142
aVit for more than two years.
p143
aVSo, you can see the duration.
p144
aVAll open, all available.
p145
aVI'm going to log in.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd this is my brother's profile.
p148
aVAnd this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.
p149
aVThis is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.
p150
aVAnd you can see here, as this animates over,
p151
aVSteven's actual data against the background of all other patients,
p152
aVagainst this information.
p153
aVThe blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,
p154
aVthat he has non-genetic ALS.
p155
aVYou scroll down in this profile and you can see
p156
aVall of his prescription drugs,
p157
aVbut more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.
p158
aVWait, poor spinal capacity.
p159
aa(lp160
VDoesn't this remind you of a great stock program?
p161
aVWouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves
p162
aVwas as good as the technology we use to make money?
p163
aVDetrol. In the side effects for his drug,
p164
aVintegrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,
p165
aVthe first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.
p166
aa(lp167
VI love here \u2014 the cyberkinetics implant,
p168
aVwhich was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.
p169
aVYou can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
p170
aVYou can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.
p171
aVSo, you click down on the ALS tab there.
p172
aVI'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.
p173
aVI can look at my constipation, how to manage it.
p174
aVI can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects
p175
aVfrom that drug all integrated in the time
p176
aVin which they're meaningful.
p177
aa(lp178
VBut I want more.
p179
aVI don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this
p180
aVdata and make something even better.
p181
aVI want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms
p182
aVand his drugs,
p183
aVand all of the things that interact among those,
p184
aVthe side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy
p185
aVthat we can look at in any way we want to understand it,
p186
aVso that we can take this information
p187
aVand go beyond just this simple model
p188
aVof what a record is.
p189
aa(lp190
VI don't even know what a medical record is.
p191
aVI want to solve a problem. I want an application.
p192
aVSo, can I take this data \u2014 rearrange yourself,
p193
aVput the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,
p194
aVtell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,
p195
aVand what interacts.
p196
aVYears after he's had these drugs,
p197
aVI learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,
p198
aVincluding some positive side effects that came from other drugs,
p199
aVwere making his constipation worse.
p200
aVAnd if anyone's ever had severe constipation,
p201
aVand you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life \u2014
p202
aVyes, that was a pun.
p203
aa(lp204
VYou're trying to manage these,
p205
aVand this grid is available here,
p206
aVand we want to understand it.
p207
aVNo one's ever had this kind of information.
p208
aVSo, patients have this. We're for patients.
p209
aVThis is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.
p210
aVThis is about the patients.
p211
aVSo, how can we take this and bring them a tool
p212
aVthat they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
p213
aVAnd we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,
p214
aV"What's something we can use all the time,
p215
aVthat we can use in the medical care system,
p216
aVthat everyone will understand?"
p217
aa(lp218
VSo, the patients print it out,
p219
aVbecause hospitals usually block us
p220
aVbecause they believe we are a social network.
p221
aVIt's actually the most used feature on the website.
p222
aVDoctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.
p223
aVSo, we went from this story of Steven
p224
aVand his history to data, and then back to paper,
p225
aVwhere we went back and engaged the medical care system.
p226
aVAnd here's another paper.
p227
aVThis is a journal, PNAS \u2014
p228
aVI think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
p229
aVof the United States of America.
p230
aVYou've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about
p231
aVthe amazing things they've done.
p232
aVThis is a report about a drug called lithium.
p233
aVLithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,
p234
aVthat a group in Italy found
p235
aVslowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.
p238
aVBut the short story is: If you're a patient,
p239
aVyou want to be on the blue line.
p240
aVYou don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
p241
aVBecause the blue line is a better line. The red line
p242
aVis way downhill, the blue line is a good line.
p243
aVSo, you know we said \u2014 we looked at this, and what I love also
p244
aVis that people always accuse these Internet sites
p245
aVof promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
p246
aVSo, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
p247
aVTen percent of the people in our system took lithium.
p248
aVTen percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data
p249
aVin a bad publication.
p250
aVAnd they call the Internet irresponsible.
p251
aVHere's the implication of what happens.
p252
aa(lp253
VThere's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,
p254
aVwho unfortunately passed away nine months ago,
p255
aVwho said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?
p256
aVBecause I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.
p257
aVI want to know now. Can you help us?"
p258
aVSo, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.
p259
aVWe let them share the data and exchange it.
p260
aVYou know, a data network.
p261
aVAnd they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,
p262
aVcan you guys tell us whether this works or not?"
p263
aVAnd we went around and we talked to people,
p264
aVand they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?
p265
aVYou don't have the blinding, you don't have data,
p266
aVit doesn't follow the scientific method.
p267
aVIt's never going to work. You can't do it."
p268
aa(lp269
VSo, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVI can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,
p272
aVbut I can say whether it works in Humberto.
p273
aVI bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,
p274
aVand I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine
p275
aVthat came in Leopard. And we said \u2014 because it's really cool,
p276
aVyou can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,
p277
aVand find everything you've lost, and I loved it.
p278
aVAnd I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,
p279
aVexcept instead of going backwards, we go forwards.
p280
aVCan we find out what's going to happen to you,
p281
aVso that you can maybe change it?"
p282
aa(lp283
VSo, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,
p284
aVThat's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time
p285
aVto build our own. This is a real app by the way.
p286
aVThis is not just graphics.
p287
aVAnd you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring
p288
aVtheir data together. And we bring their histories into it.
p289
aVAnd then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"
p290
aVSo, we line them all up so they go together
p291
aVaround the meaningful points,
p292
aVintegrated across everything we know about the patient.
p293
aVFull information, the entire course of their disease.
p294
aVAnd that's what is going to happen to Humberto,
p295
aVunless he does something.
p296
aVAnd he took lithium, and he went down the line.
p297
aVAnd it works almost every time.
p298
aa(lp299
VNow, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.
p300
aVBut almost all the time it works.
p301
aVIt's actually scary. It's beautiful.
p302
aVSo, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
p303
aVBut we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
p304
aVAnd yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power
p305
aVand all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.
p306
aVBut here is the answer
p307
aVof the mean of the patients that actually decided
p308
aVto take lithium.
p309
aVThese are all the patients that started lithium.
p310
aVIt's the Intent to Treat Curve.
p311
aVYou can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,
p312
aVthose are the people in the study in PNAS
p313
aVthat you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,
p314
aVthe pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.
p315
aVAnd the ones in the middle are all of our patients
p316
aVfrom the start of lithium at time zero,
p317
aVgoing forward, and then going backward.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.
p320
aVTerrifyingly accurate matching.
p321
aVAnd going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
p322
aVYou're actually doing slightly worse \u2014 not significantly,
p323
aVbut slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
p324
aVBut you know, a lot of people dropped out,
p325
aVthe trial, there is too much drop out.
p326
aVCan we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients
p327
aVthat actually decided to stay on lithium,
p328
aVbecause they were so convinced they were getting better?
p329
aa(lp330
VWe asked our control algorithm,
p331
aVare those 69 patients \u2014 by the way, you'll notice
p332
aVthat's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial \u2014
p333
aVcan we look at those patients and say,
p334
aV"Can we match them with our time machine
p335
aVto the other patients that are just like them,
p336
aVand what happens?"
p337
aVEven the ones that believed they were getting better
p338
aVmatched the controls exactly. Exactly.
p339
aVThose little lines? That's the power.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo, we \u2014 I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you
p342
aVthat if you did it at a higher dose
p343
aVor if you run the study proper \u2014 I can tell you
p344
aVthat for those 69 people that took lithium,
p345
aVthey didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,
p346
aVjust like me,
p347
aVand that we had the power to detect that at about
p348
aVa quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.
p349
aVWe did that one year ahead of the time
p350
aVwhen the first clinical trial funded by the NIH
p351
aVfor millions of dollars failed for futility last week,
p352
aVand announced it.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.
p355
aVI never really knew whether it worked.
p356
aVAnd I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,
p357
aVin his lumbar cord,
p358
aVand filled out the IRBs and did all this work,
p359
aVand I never really knew.
p360
aVHow did I not know?
p361
aVI mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
p362
aVI actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group \u2014
p363
aVwe actually searched for about a year to find someone
p364
aVwho could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling
p365
aVin healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.
p366
aVAnd there are these guys who used to model the future
p367
aVof interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.
p368
aVAnd some of them were available. So, we hired one.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VWe hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.
p372
aVI I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,
p373
aVis like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,
p374
aV"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant
p375
aVworked or not?"
p376
aVAnd he sent me this two days ago.
p377
aVIt was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?
p378
aVWe have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.
p379
aVBecause something went different.
p380
aVBut my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.
p381
aVIt only works about 12 months.
p382
aa(lp383
VIt's the first version of the time machine.
p384
aVFirst time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later
p385
aVbut 12 months so far.
p386
aVAnd, you know, I look at this,
p387
aVand I get really emotional.
p388
aVYou look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,
p389
aVyou can look at them, you can ask them.
p390
aVAnd I found a woman that had \u2014
p391
aVwe found her, she was odd because she had data
p392
aVafter she died.
p393
aVAnd her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,
p394
aVbecause he knew how much she cared.
p395
aVAnd I am thankful.
p396
aa(lp397
VI can't believe that these people,
p398
aVyears after my brother had died,
p399
aVhelped me answer the question about whether
p400
aVan operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on
p401
aVyears ago, worked or not.
p402
aVI wished it had been there
p403
aVwhen I'd done it the first time,
p404
aVand I'm really excited that it's here now,
p405
aVbecause the lab that I founded
p406
aVhas some data on a drug that might work,
p407
aVand I'd like to show it.
p408
aVI'd like to show it in real time, now,
p409
aVand I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.
p410
aVI've got to thank the 45,000 people
p411
aVthat are doing this social experiment with us.
p412
aVThere is an amazing journey we are going on
p413
aVto become human again,
p414
aVto be part of community again,
p415
aVto share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,
p416
aVand it's very exciting. So, thank you.
