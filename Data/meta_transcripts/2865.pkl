VThis is my favorite place on earth,
p4
aVSalar de Uyuni in Bolivia.
p5
aVAnd when it's covered in a thin layer of water,
p6
aVit reflects the clouds.
p7
aVThere are days when you feel as if you're floating among the clouds.
p8
aVBut there are days when the horizon disappears;
p9
aVthere's no longer a top or a bottom.
p10
aVYou feel immersed in something bigger.
p11
aa(lp12
VIt was there that one night I woke up from a dream,
p13
aVand I saw that the stars were also reflected on the water.
p14
aVAnd that wasn't a dream.
p15
aVIt was as if you could walk among the stars.
p16
aVWith every step I took, the stars reverberated under my feet.
p17
aVIt was like I was floating in the universe among clouds of galaxies.
p18
aa(lp19
VBut what's floating there today are not just clouds of galaxies
p20
aVbut also clouds of plastic.
p21
aVThese are the footprints we're leaving on the planet.
p22
aVThey're signs of an era
p23
aVin which the behavior of some humans is making a global impact
p24
aVon our ecosystems.
p25
aVThis era is called the Anthropocene.
p26
aVThere's also another type of toxic clouds that float in the air,
p27
aVlike the ones that form from carbon dioxide emissions
p28
aVand from the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, carbon, gas \u2014
p29
aVclouds that, when we see them,
p30
aVpollute our dreams.
p31
aVI don't know about all of you,
p32
aVbut I've always dreamed of floating among the clouds.
p33
aVMaybe today we can imagine together other types of clouds,
p34
aVclouds we can live with.
p35
aa(lp36
VIf you're wondering about that photo, I'll explain:
p37
aVit looks like a collage or photomontage \u2014 something weird.
p38
aVNo; it's reality.
p39
aVBut sometimes I ask myself: What is reality?
p40
aVAccording to Alexander Kluge:
p41
aV"Human beings are not interested in reality.
p42
aVThey can\u2019t be; it\u2019s part of the human essence.
p43
aVThey have desires.
p44
aVThese desires are totally opposed to any form of reality.
p45
aVThey prefer to lie
p46
aVthan to become divorced from their desires."
p47
aVBut how can we learn to float among the clouds?
p48
aVAs an artist, I thought we could start building a flying museum.
p49
aVYou're probably wondering: With plastic bags?
p50
aa(lp51
VIn 2007, with a community of people all over the world,
p52
aVwe began to collect used plastic bags \u2014
p53
aVnot new ones.
p54
aVAnd we washed them,
p55
aVwe cut them up,
p56
aVwe glued them together,
p57
aVand we began to draw on them,
p58
aVcreating a huge canvas.
p59
aVWe made a collection of drawings,
p60
aVof personal stories
p61
aVand of friendships.
p62
aVAnd when you join them,
p63
aVbend them and fold them,
p64
aVit creates a space full of air.
p65
aVWhen the sun comes up from the horizon,
p66
aVthe museum rises up to the sky.
p67
aVThat's why we call it, "The Aero-Solar Museum."
p68
aVAnd from this simple idea,
p69
aVwe learned how to float in the air in a radically new way,
p70
aVwithout using any type of fuel.
p71
aVThe difference in temperature between the interior and the exterior
p72
aVis what makes us rise up.
p73
aVThat way,
p74
aVwe don't use fossil fuels or helium or hydrogen;
p75
aVwe don't use solar panels
p76
aVor batteries or motors.
p77
aVWe discovered a way that's simple, clean and accessible to the whole world
p78
aVto lift ourselves up.
p79
aa(lp80
VI remember when I was at NASA in 2009 with 120 engineers.
p81
aVYou guys know, too, when you go up in a plane,
p82
aVthe control panels are gigantic.
p83
aVAnd what we're doing is really complex,
p84
aVand when I started coming in with the plastic bags, saying,
p85
aV"But we have a different way ..."
p86
aVpeople had a hard time understanding the concept.
p87
aVSeeing the power of this idea,
p88
aVwe started to initiate a new era;
p89
aVone that would leave behind the violence of the Anthropocene
p90
aVand give way to a new era,
p91
aVwhich we call the "Aerocene" \u2014
p92
aVan era of ecological awareness,
p93
aVin which we learn to float together, live together in the air,
p94
aVand come to an ethical commitment
p95
aVwith the atmosphere and with planet earth.
p96
aVThat's why I've brought this backpack today.
p97
aVLet's see ...
p98
aa(lp99
VOK. This is a balloon that we also refer to as a sculpture.
p100
aVAnd if it's sunny out tomorrow, we can go out and fly \u2014
p101
aVthough, no, the weather in Vancouver isn't \u2014
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
Vit's not very ...
p106
aVvery favorable.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, what other features does it have?
p109
aVIt has sensors that, when it moves,
p110
aVmake sort of drawings in the air.
p111
aVIt also has other sensors.
p112
aVI always think that first you have to feel it,
p113
aVand then you can measure it;
p114
aVyou need to hear the sounds of the atmosphere,
p115
aVof the climate, of the hot air,
p116
aVin order to then measure the ozone,
p117
aVthe carbon dioxide.
p118
aVWe're developing these sensors
p119
aVtogether with different communities all over the world
p120
aVin order to reconnect with the climate, the temperature and the environment,
p121
aVbecause there are other species in the air;
p122
aVin these excursions towards the atmosphere,
p123
aVwe're not alone.
p124
aVThe air is full of clouds of life.
p125
aVWe live at the bottom of an ocean of air.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd this same sculpture,
p128
aVthis exact one in my hands,
p129
aVflew 375 miles \u2014 12 hours \u2014 from Germany to Poland,
p130
aVon a fuel-free trip.
p131
aVBut it wasn't free from crossing borders.
p132
aVThe trip was much more complicated than what we imagined;
p133
aVair space is as regulated and militarized
p134
aVas land space.
p135
aVTo fly using the winds, the heat of the sun
p136
aVand the radiant energy of the earth
p137
aVis complex and beautiful.
p138
aVBut even more complex will be getting the permits
p139
aVto cross the air space of each of the different countries
p140
aVthat we fly over using wind.
p141
aa(lp142
VAt COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,
p143
aVwe presented these spherical sculptures
p144
aVthat could transport us all over the world.
p145
aVBut how can we fly using the wind to arrive at our destination?
p146
aVTogether with MIT, we developed a program
p147
aVthat predicts how we can navigate the wind highways.
p148
aVFor example, if I had to return to Berlin from Vancouver,
p149
aVthe first thing I would need to do is choose an altitude.
p150
aVAt different altitudes, there are different directions
p151
aVand different speeds.
p152
aVThe red line is tomorrow and the orange, the day after tomorrow.
p153
aVAnd there it goes.
p154
aVYou can see, the best day to fly back to Berlin \u2014
p155
aVso now, traveling using only wind \u2014
p156
aVis in six days.
p157
aVAnd we can get to 105 miles from the center of Berlin
p158
aVwithout burning a single drop of fuel,
p159
aVbeing transported only by wind currents.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo we thought that these trajectories that we drew with the wind
p162
aVcould become signatures, declaring "Independence from Fossil Fuels Day."
p163
aVMore and more of us are experiencing the air
p164
aVin a different way.
p165
aVYou're all familiar with Earth Day.
p166
aVWe think we should also celebrate Air Day:
p167
aVit's a pact that we make with the earth,
p168
aVan ethical commitment to the atmosphere.
p169
aVBut let's keep thinking and dreaming.
p170
aa(lp171
VWe've learned that the bigger the sculptures are,
p172
aVthe more weight they can lift.
p173
aVRemember,
p174
aVthey rise up only with hot air that's been heated by the sun.
p175
aVUsing this approach, we can learn to build gardens in the air.
p176
aVCould we one day live in a garden the size of the earth?
p177
aVCould we live in an ecosystem floating among the clouds?
p178
aVAnswering these questions isn't just a technological challenge;
p179
aVit's a way to reexamine the freedom of movement between countries,
p180
aVand of overcoming the political, social, cultural and military restrictions
p181
aVof contemporary societies.
p182
aVBecause in the end,
p183
aVthe air belongs to everybody
p184
aVand doesn't answer to any government.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd like we said earlier,
p189
aVour imagination is the force that allows us to create these places.
p190
aa(lp191
VThis is an installation I did
p192
aVat the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
p193
aVIt asks the question:
p194
aVWhat might these transnational spaces be like?
p195
aVAnd once we inhabit those spaces, we need to learn how to move within them,
p196
aVto walk among the clouds,
p197
aVwhere every movement affects everyone else's movements;
p198
aVthe body weight and proximity between people
p199
aVwill cause the space to expand ...
p200
aVor contract.
p201
aVThere we are, suspended 72 feet in the air.
p202
aVWhen two or more people get too close together,
p203
aVeven those farthest away are affected \u2014
p204
aVeveryone falls to the same spot.
p205
aVThese are fragile ecosystems.
p206
aVAnd it's between these spheres that we build nets that connect us.
p207
aVThere are moments when we have to face the void,
p208
aVand fear can paralyze us.
p209
aVOne of the most beautiful things about this exhibit
p210
aVis the sense of solidarity generated
p211
aVwhen we face these new "aero-graphs."
p212
aa(lp213
VFinally,
p214
aVlet me tell you one last story.
p215
aVOn July 16, 1945,
p216
aVon the White Sands of New Mexico,
p217
aVan atomic bomb was detonated for the first time.
p218
aVAs a result of this explosion,
p219
aVa cloud of radioactive particles disseminated all over the earth,
p220
aVmarking the beginning of the Anthropocene era.
p221
aVSeventy years later, on November 8, 2015,
p222
aVin the same place,
p223
aVanother event occurred.
p224
aVFor the first time in history,
p225
aVwe lifted a person into the air using only the sun,
p226
aVwithout burning any fossil fuels.
p227
aVAs the sun rose up above the horizon,
p228
aVwe rose up, too,
p229
aVsilently,
p230
aVslowly,
p231
aVwith no explosions.
p232
aVWe felt as if gravity had been inverted;
p233
aVit wasn't pulling us toward the center of the earth,
p234
aVbut toward the universe.
p235
aVIf Neil Armstrong said, when he walked on the moon,
p236
aV"That's one small step for man,
p237
aVone giant leap for mankind,"
p238
aVperhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:
p239
aVWhat steps do we need to take today?
p240
aa(lp241
VIn the Aerocene era,
p242
aVour steps are much smaller, but radically different;
p243
aVthey're steps that began with a bag full of air and wishes,
p244
aVbut that can carry us to independence from fossil fuels
p245
aVand the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;
p246
aVsteps that won't leave footprints on other planets
p247
aVuntil we've learned to walk in the atmosphere of this one.
p248
aVThe landscapes are tiny
p249
aVand the steps are tiny,
p250
aVbut I hope we can take them together.
p251
aVAnd I'm sure that these steps will lead us much further than the moon,
p252
aVso we can learn to float with our feet on the ground.
