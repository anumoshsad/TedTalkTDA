VLiving in Africa is to be on the edge,
p4
aVmetaphorically, and quite literally
p5
aVwhen you think about connectivity before 2008.
p6
aVThough many human intellectual and technological leaps
p7
aVhad happened in Europe and the rest of the world,
p8
aVbut Africa was sort of cut off.
p9
aVAnd that changed, first with ships
p10
aVwhen we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution
p11
aVand also the Industrial Revolution.
p12
aVAnd now we've got the digital revolution.
p13
aVThese revolutions have not been evenly distributed
p14
aVacross continents and nations.
p15
aVNever have been.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables
p18
aVthat connect Africa to the rest of the world.
p19
aVWhat I find amazing is that Africa
p20
aVis transcending its geography problem.
p21
aVAfrica is connecting to the rest of the world
p22
aVand within itself.
p23
aVThe connectivity situation has improved greatly,
p24
aVbut some barriers remain.
p25
aVIt is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.
p26
aa(lp27
VIn 2008, one of the problems that we faced
p28
aVwas lack of information flow.
p29
aVThere was a media blackout in 2008,
p30
aVwhen there was post-election violence in Kenya.
p31
aVIt was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.
p32
aVSo we came together and we created software
p33
aVcalled Ushahidi.
p34
aVAnd Ushahidi means "testimony" or "witness" in Swahili.
p35
aVI'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.
p36
aVThis is David and Erik.
p37
aVI call them brothers from another mother.
p38
aVClearly I have a German mother somewhere.
p39
aVAnd we worked together first with building
p40
aVand growing Ushahidi.
p41
aVAnd the idea of the software was to gather information
p42
aVfrom SMS, email and web, and put a map
p43
aVso that you could see what was happening where,
p44
aVand you could visualize that data.
p45
aVAnd after that initial prototype,
p46
aVwe set out to make free and open-source software
p47
aVso that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.
p48
aa(lp49
VAll the while, we also wanted to give back
p50
aVto the local tech community that helped us
p51
aVgrow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
p52
aVAnd that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,
p53
aVan actual physical space
p54
aVwhere we could collaborate,
p55
aVand it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.
p56
aVWe did that with the support of different organizations
p57
aVlike the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd we were able to grow this software footprint,
p60
aVand a few years later it became
p61
aVvery useful software,
p62
aVand we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti
p63
aVwhere citizens could indicate where they are
p64
aVand what their needs were,
p65
aVand also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis
p66
aVand the tsunami in Japan.
p67
aVNow, this year the Internet turns 20,
p68
aVand Ushahidi turned five.
p69
aa(lp70
VUshahidi is not only the software that we made.
p71
aVIt is the team, and it's also the community
p72
aVthat uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.
p73
aVWe did not imagine that there would be this many maps
p74
aVaround the world.
p75
aVThere are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,
p76
aVand even environmental monitoring crowd maps.
p77
aVWe are humbled that this has roots in Kenya
p78
aVand that it has some use to people around the world
p79
aVtrying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.
p80
aVThere is more that we're doing to explore this idea
p81
aVof collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,
p82
aVif I share the information with whatever device that I have,
p83
aVcould inform you about what is going on,
p84
aVand that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture
p85
aVof what's going on.
p86
aa(lp87
VI moved back to Kenya in 2011.
p88
aVErik moved in 2010.
p89
aVVery different reality. I used to live in Chicago
p90
aVwhere there was abundant Internet access.
p91
aVI had never had to deal with a blackout.
p92
aVAnd in Kenya, it's a very different reality,
p93
aVand one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress
p94
aVand the digital revolution is the electricity problem.
p95
aVThe day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this
p96
aVcan be, let's just say very annoying.
p97
aVBlackouts are not fun.
p98
aVImagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden
p99
aVthe power goes out,
p100
aVyour Internet connection goes down with it,
p101
aVso you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,
p102
aVhow do I switch back?
p103
aVAnd then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.
p104
aVNow, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,
p105
aVand other parts of Africa.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe other problem that we're facing
p108
aVis that communication costs are also still a challenge.
p109
aVIt costs me five Kenyan shillings,
p110
aVor .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.
p111
aVGuess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?
p112
aVThirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost
p113
aVto connect within Africa.
p114
aVAnd also, when traveling within Africa,
p115
aVyou've got different settings for different mobile providers.
p116
aVThis is the reality that we deal with.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo we've got a joke in Ushahidi
p119
aVwhere we say, "If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."
p120
aV[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]
p121
aVWhat if we could overcome the problem
p122
aVof unreliable Internet and electricity
p123
aVand reduce the cost of connection?
p124
aVCould we leverage the cloud?
p125
aVWe've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.
p126
aVCould we leverage these technologies
p127
aVto switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?
p128
aa(lp129
VSo we looked at the modem,
p130
aVan important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,
p131
aVand asked ourselves why
p132
aVthe modems that we are using right now
p133
aVare built for a different context, where you've got
p134
aVubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,
p135
aVyet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.
p136
aVWe wanted to redesign the modem
p137
aVfor the developing world, for our context,
p138
aVand for our reality.
p139
aVWhat if we could have connectivity with less friction?
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is the BRCK.
p142
aVIt acts as a backup to the Internet
p143
aVso that, when the power goes out,
p144
aVit fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.
p145
aVMobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.
p146
aVIt's actually everywhere.
p147
aVMost towns at least have a 3G connection.
p148
aVSo why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.
p149
aVThe other reason that we built this
p150
aVis when electricity goes down, this has eight hours
p151
aVof battery left, so you can continue working,
p152
aVyou can continue being productive,
p153
aVand let's just say you are less stressed.
p154
aVAnd for rural areas, it can be
p155
aVthe primary means of connection.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play
p158
aVwhen we wondered how can we use the cloud
p159
aVto be more intelligent so that
p160
aVyou can analyze the different networks,
p161
aVand whenever you switch on the backup,
p162
aVyou pick on the fastest network,
p163
aVso we'll have multi-SIM capability
p164
aVso that you can put multiple SIMs,
p165
aVand if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,
p166
aVand if the up time on that is not very good,
p167
aVthen you hop onto the next one.
p168
aVThe idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.
p169
aVWith load balancing, this can be possible.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe other interesting thing for us \u2014 we like sensors \u2014
p172
aVis this idea that you could have an on-ramp
p173
aVfor the Internet of things.
p174
aVImagine a weather station that can be attached to this.
p175
aVIt's built in a modular way so that you can also attach
p176
aVa satellite module so that you could have
p177
aVInternet connectivity even in very remote areas.
p178
aa(lp179
VOut of adversity can come innovation,
p180
aVand how can we help the ambitious coders and makers
p181
aVin Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?
p182
aVAnd for us, we begin with solving the problem
p183
aVin our own backyard in Kenya.
p184
aa(lp185
VIt is not without challenge.
p186
aVOur team has basically been mules carrying components
p187
aVfrom the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations
p188
aVwith customs border agents.
p189
aV"What are you carrying?"
p190
aVAnd the local financing is not
p191
aVpart of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.
p192
aVSo we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,
p193
aVthrough the support of many people,
p194
aVnot only here but online,
p195
aVthe BRCK has been Kickstarted,
p196
aVand now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.
p197
aa(lp198
VI will close by saying that, if we solve this
p199
aVfor the local market, it could be impactful
p200
aVnot only for the coders in Nairobi
p201
aVbut also for small business owners
p202
aVwho need reliable connectivity,
p203
aVand it can reduce the cost of connecting,
p204
aVand hopefully collaboration within African countries.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy
p207
aVare connectivity and entrepreneurship.
p208
aVThe BRCK is our part
p209
aVto keep Africans connected,
p210
aVand to help them drive the global digital revolution.
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you.
