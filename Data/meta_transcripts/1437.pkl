VWhat you have here
p4
aVis an electronic cigarette.
p5
aVIt's something that, since it was invented a year or two ago,
p6
aVhas given me untold happiness.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VA little bit of it, I think, is the nicotine,
p11
aVbut there's something much bigger than that;
p12
aVwhich is, ever since, in the UK, they banned smoking in public places,
p13
aVI've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd the reason, I only worked out just the other day,
p18
aVwhich is: when you go to a drinks party and you stand up
p19
aVand hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people,
p20
aVyou don't actually want to spend all the time talking.
p21
aVIt's really, really tiring.
p22
aVSometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts.
p23
aVSometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window.
p24
aVNow the problem is, when you can't smoke,
p25
aVif you stand and stare out of the window on your own,
p26
aVyou're an antisocial, friendless idiot.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VIf you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette,
p31
aVyou're a fucking philosopher.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo the power of reframing things
p38
aVcannot be overstated.
p39
aVWhat we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity,
p40
aVbut one of them makes you feel great
p41
aVand the other one, with just a small change of posture,
p42
aVmakes you feel terrible.
p43
aVAnd I think one of the problems with classical economics is,
p44
aVit's absolutely preoccupied with reality.
p45
aVAnd reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness.
p46
aVWhy, for example, are pensioners much happier
p47
aVthan the young unemployed?
p48
aVBoth of them, after all, are in exactly the same stage of life.
p49
aVYou both have too much time on your hands and not much money.
p50
aVBut pensioners are reportedly very, very happy,
p51
aVwhereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.
p52
aVThe reason, I think, is that the pensioners believe
p53
aVthey've chosen to be pensioners,
p54
aVwhereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn England, the upper-middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly,
p57
aVbecause they've re-branded unemployment.
p58
aVIf you're an upper-middle-class English person,
p59
aVyou call unemployment "a year off."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester
p64
aVis really quite embarrassing.
p65
aVBut having a son who's unemployed in Thailand
p66
aVis really viewed as quite an accomplishment.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VBut actually, the power to re-brand things \u2014
p71
aVto understand that our experiences, costs, things
p72
aVdon't actually much depend on what they really are,
p73
aVbut on how we view them \u2014
p74
aVI genuinely think can't be overstated.
p75
aa(lp76
VThere's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to,
p77
aVwhere you put two dogs in a box
p78
aVand the box has an electric floor.
p79
aVEvery now and then, an electric shock is applied to the floor,
p80
aVwhich pains the dogs.
p81
aVThe only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box.
p82
aVAnd when it nuzzles the button, the electric shock stops.
p83
aVThe other dog doesn't have the button.
p84
aVIt's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box,
p85
aVbut it has no control over the circumstances.
p86
aVGenerally, the first dog can be relatively content.
p87
aVThe second dog lapses into complete depression.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness
p90
aVthan the sense of control we feel over our lives.
p91
aVIt's an interesting question.
p92
aVWe ask the question \u2014 the whole debate in the Western world
p93
aVis about the level of taxation.
p94
aVBut I think there's another debate to be asked,
p95
aVwhich is the level of control we have over our tax money,
p96
aVthat what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse;
p97
aVwhat costs us 10 pounds in a different context, we may actually welcome.
p98
aVYou know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health,
p99
aVand you're merely feeling a mug.
p100
aVPay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward,
p101
aVand you're called a philanthropist.
p102
aVI'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I'll give you one in return: how you frame things really matters.
p107
aVDo you call it "The bailout of Greece"?
p108
aVOr "The bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece"?
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VBecause they are actually the same thing.
p113
aVWhat you call them actually affects how you react to them,
p114
aVviscerally and morally.
p115
aVI think psychological value is great, to be absolutely honest.
p116
aVOne of my great friends, a professor called Nick Chater,
p117
aVwho's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London,
p118
aVbelieves we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths,
p119
aVand spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows.
p120
aVI think that's true, actually.
p121
aVI think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do.
p122
aVBut what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology \u2014
p123
aVat least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,
p124
aVwe didn't have a really good model of human psychology
p125
aVto put alongside models of engineering, of neoclassical economics.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model.
p128
aVWe didn't have a framework.
p129
aVThis is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls
p130
aV"a latticework on which to hang your ideas."
p131
aVEngineers, economists, classical economists
p132
aVall had a very, very robust existing latticework
p133
aVon which practically every idea could be hung.
p134
aVWe merely have a collection of random individual insights
p135
aVwithout an overall model.
p136
aVAnd what that means is that, in looking at solutions,
p137
aVwe've probably given too much priority
p138
aVto what I call technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions,
p139
aVand not nearly enough to the psychological ones.
p140
aa(lp141
VYou know my example of the Eurostar:
p142
aVsix million pounds spent
p143
aVto reduce the journey time between Paris and London
p144
aVby about 40 minutes.
p145
aVFor 0.01 percent of this money, you could have put wi-fi on the trains,
p146
aVwhich wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey,
p147
aVbut would have improved its enjoyment and its usefulness far more.
p148
aVFor maybe 10 percent of the money,
p149
aVyou could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels
p150
aVto walk up and down the train handing out free Château Pétrus
p151
aVto all the passengers.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VYou'd still have five million pounds in change,
p156
aVand people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VWhy were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically?
p161
aVI think it's because there's an imbalance,
p162
aVan asymmetry in the way we treat creative, emotionally driven psychological ideas
p163
aVversus the way we treat rational, numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.
p164
aVIf you're a creative person, I think, quite rightly,
p165
aVyou have to share all your ideas for approval
p166
aVwith people much more rational than you.
p167
aVYou have to go in and have a cost-benefit analysis,
p168
aVa feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth.
p169
aVAnd I think that's probably right.
p170
aVBut this does not apply the other way around.
p171
aVPeople who have an existing framework \u2014
p172
aVan economic framework, an engineering framework \u2014
p173
aVfeel that, actually, logic is its own answer.
p174
aVWhat they don't say is, "Well, the numbers all seem to add up,
p175
aVbut before I present this idea, I'll show it to some really crazy people
p176
aVto see if they can come up with something better."
p177
aVAnd so we \u2014 artificially, I think \u2014 prioritize
p178
aVwhat I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas.
p179
aa(lp180
VAn example of a great psychological idea:
p181
aVthe single best improvement in passenger satisfaction
p182
aVon the London Underground,
p183
aVper pound spent,
p184
aVcame when they didn't add any extra trains,
p185
aVnor change the frequency of the trains;
p186
aVthey put dot matrix display boards on the platforms \u2014
p187
aVbecause the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality,
p188
aVits duration,
p189
aVbut on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait.
p190
aVWaiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock
p191
aVis less frustrating and irritating
p192
aVthan waiting four minutes, knuckle biting, going,
p193
aV"When's this train going to damn well arrive?"
p194
aa(lp195
VHere's a beautiful example of a psychological solution
p196
aVdeployed in Korea.
p197
aVRed traffic lights have a countdown delay.
p198
aVIt's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments.
p199
aVWhy?
p200
aVBecause road rage, impatience and general irritation are massively reduced
p201
aVwhen you can actually see the time you have to wait.
p202
aVIn China, not really understanding the principle behind this,
p203
aVthey applied the same principle to green traffic lights \u2014
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
Vwhich isn't a great idea.
p208
aVYou're 200 yards away, you realize you've got five seconds to go,
p209
aVyou floor it.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThe Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.
p214
aVThe accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights;
p215
aVit goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is all I'm asking for, really, in human decision making,
p218
aVis the consideration of these three things.
p219
aVI'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other.
p220
aVI'm merely saying that when you solve problems,
p221
aVyou should look at all three of these equally,
p222
aVand you should seek as far as possible
p223
aVto find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle.
p224
aa(lp225
VIf you actually look at a great business,
p226
aVyou'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play.
p227
aVReally successful businesses \u2014
p228
aVGoogle is a great, great technological success,
p229
aVbut it's also based on a very good psychological insight:
p230
aVpeople believe something that only does one thing
p231
aVis better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else.
p232
aVIt's an innate thing called "goal dilution."
p233
aVAyelet Fishbach has written a paper about this.
p234
aa(lp235
VEverybody else at the time of Google, more or less,
p236
aVwas trying to be a portal.
p237
aVYes, there's a search function, but you also have weather,
p238
aVsports scores, bits of news.
p239
aVGoogle understood that if you're just a search engine,
p240
aVpeople assume you're a very, very good search engine.
p241
aVAll of you know this, actually, from when you go in to buy a television,
p242
aVand in the shabbier end of the row of flat-screen TVs,
p243
aVyou can see, are these rather despised things
p244
aVcalled "combined TV and DVD players."
p245
aVAnd we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things,
p246
aVbut we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.
p247
aVIt's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."
p248
aVSo we walk out of the shops with one of each.
p249
aVGoogle is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one.
p250
aa(lp251
VI propose that we can use psychology to solve problems
p252
aVthat we didn't even realize were problems at all.
p253
aVThis is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics.
p254
aVDon't give them 24 white pills;
p255
aVgive them 18 white pills and six blue ones
p256
aVand tell them to take the white pills first,
p257
aVand then take the blue ones.
p258
aVIt's called "chunking."
p259
aVThe likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater
p260
aVwhen there is a milestone somewhere in the middle.
p261
aa(lp262
VOne of the great mistakes, I think, of economics
p263
aVis it fails to understand that what something is \u2014
p264
aVwhether it's retirement, unemployment, cost \u2014
p265
aVis a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning.
p266
aa(lp267
VThis is a toll crossing in Britain.
p268
aVQuite often queues happen at the tolls.
p269
aVSometimes you get very, very severe queues.
p270
aVYou could apply the same principle, actually,
p271
aVto the security lanes in airports.
p272
aVWhat would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money
p273
aVto cross the bridge,
p274
aVbut go through a lane that's an express lane?
p275
aVIt's not an unreasonable thing to do;
p276
aVit's an economically efficient thing to do.
p277
aVTime means more to some people than others.
p278
aVIf you're waiting trying to get to a job interview,
p279
aVyou'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane.
p280
aVIf you're on the way to visit your mother-in-law,
p281
aVyou'd probably prefer \u2014
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
Vyou'd probably prefer to stay on the left.
p286
aa(lp287
VThe only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution,
p288
aVpeople hate it ...
p289
aVbecause they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge
p290
aVin order to maximize your revenue,
p291
aVand, "Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your incompetence?"
p292
aVOn the other hand, change the frame slightly
p293
aVand create charitable yield management,
p294
aVso the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company,
p295
aVit goes to charity ...
p296
aVand the mental willingness to pay completely changes.
p297
aVYou have a relatively economically efficient solution,
p298
aVbut one that actually meets with public approval
p299
aVand even a small degree of affection,
p300
aVrather than being seen as bastardy.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo where economists make the fundamental mistake
p303
aVis they think that money is money.
p304
aVActually, my pain experienced in paying five pounds
p305
aVis not just proportionate to the amount,
p306
aVbut where I think that money is going.
p307
aVAnd I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy.
p308
aVIt could revolutionize the public services.
p309
aVIt could actually change things quite significantly.
p310
aa(lp311
V[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]
p312
aa(lp313
VHere's a guy you all need to study.
p314
aVHe's an Austrian School economist
p315
aVwho was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna.
p316
aVWhat was interesting about the Austrian School
p317
aVis they actually grew up alongside Freud.
p318
aVAnd so they're predominantly interested in psychology.
p319
aVThey believed that there was a discipline called praxeology,
p320
aVwhich is a prior discipline to the study of economics.
p321
aVPraxeology is the study of human choice, action and decision-making.
p322
aVI think they're right.
p323
aVI think the danger we have in today's world
p324
aVis we have the study of economics
p325
aVconsiders itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology.
p326
aVBut as Charlie Munger says, "If economics isn't behavioral,
p327
aVI don't know what the hell is."
p328
aa(lp329
VVon Mises, interestingly, believes economics is just a subset of psychology.
p330
aVI think he just refers to economics
p331
aVas "the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity."
p332
aVBut Von Mises, among many other things,
p333
aVI think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation
p334
aVfor the value of marketing, the value of perceived value
p335
aVand the fact that we should treat it as being absolutely equivalent
p336
aVto any other kind of value.
p337
aa(lp338
VWe tend to, all of us, even those of us who work in marketing,
p339
aVthink of value in two ways:
p340
aVthe real value, which is when you make something in a factory
p341
aVor provide a service,
p342
aVand then there's a dubious value,
p343
aVwhich you create by changing the way people look at things.
p344
aVVon Mises completely rejected this distinction.
p345
aVAnd he used this following analogy:
p346
aVhe referred to strange economists called the French physiocrats,
p347
aVwho believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land.
p348
aVSo if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer,
p349
aVyou created true value.
p350
aVIf however, you bought some wool from the shepherd
p351
aVand charged a premium for converting it into a hat,
p352
aVyou weren't actually creating value,
p353
aVyou were exploiting the shepherd.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, Von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake
p356
aVwith regard to advertising and marketing.
p357
aVHe says if you run a restaurant,
p358
aVthere is no healthy distinction to be made
p359
aVbetween the value you create by cooking the food
p360
aVand the value you create by sweeping the floor.
p361
aVOne of them creates, perhaps, the primary product \u2014
p362
aVthe thing we think we're paying for \u2014
p363
aVthe other one creates a context within which we can enjoy
p364
aVand appreciate that product.
p365
aVAnd the idea that one of them should have priority over the other
p366
aVis fundamentally wrong.
p367
aa(lp368
VTry this quick thought experiment:
p369
aVimagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food,
p370
aVbut where the restaurant smells of sewage
p371
aVand there's human feces on the floor.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Laughter)
p374
aa(lp375
VThe best thing you can do there to create value
p376
aVis not actually to improve the food still further,
p377
aVit's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor.
p378
aVAnd it's vital we understand this.
p379
aa(lp380
VIf that seems like a sort of strange, abstruse thing \u2014
p381
aVin the UK, the post office had a 98 percent success rate
p382
aVat delivering first-class mail the next day.
p383
aVThey decided this wasn't good enough,
p384
aVand they wanted to get it up to 99.
p385
aVThe effort to do that almost broke the organization.
p386
aVIf, at the same time, you'd gone and asked people,
p387
aV"What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day?"
p388
aVthe average answer, or the modal answer, would have been "50 to 60 percent."
p389
aVNow, if your perception is much worse than your reality,
p390
aVwhat on earth are you doing trying to change the reality?
p391
aVThat's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks.
p392
aVWhat you need to do is, first of all, tell people
p393
aVthat 98 percent of first-class mail gets there the next day.
p394
aVThat's pretty good.
p395
aVI would argue, in Britain, there's a much better frame of reference,
p396
aVwhich is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day
p397
aVin the UK than in Germany, because generally, in Britain,
p398
aVif you want to make us happy about something,
p399
aVjust tell us we do it better than the Germans.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
V(Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VChoose your frame of reference and the perceived value,
p406
aVand therefore, the actual value is completely transformed.
p407
aVIt has to be said of the Germans
p408
aVthat the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job
p409
aVof creating a united Europe.
p410
aVThe only thing they didn't expect is they're uniting Europe
p411
aVthrough a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans.
p412
aVBut I'm British; that's the way we like it.
p413
aa(lp414
V(Laughter)
p415
aa(lp416
VWhat you'll also notice is that, in any case,
p417
aVour perception is leaky.
p418
aVWe can't tell the difference between the quality of the food
p419
aVand the environment in which we consume it.
p420
aVAll of you will have seen this phenomenon
p421
aVif you have your car washed or valeted.
p422
aVWhen you drive away, your car feels as if it drives better.
p423
aa(lp424
V(Laughter)
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd the reason for this \u2014
p427
aVunless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil
p428
aVand performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of \u2014
p429
aVis because perception is, in any case, leaky.
p430
aa(lp431
VAnalgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain
p432
aVthan analgesics that are not branded.
p433
aVI don't just mean through reported pain reduction \u2014
p434
aVactual measured pain reduction.
p435
aVAnd so perception actually is leaky in any case.
p436
aVSo if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect,
p437
aVyou can damage the other.
