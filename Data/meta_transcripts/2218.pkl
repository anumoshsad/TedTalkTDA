VLet me show you something.

aa(lp5
V(Video) Girl: Okay, that's a cat sitting in a bed.
p6
aVThe boy is petting the elephant.
p7
aVThose are people that are going on an airplane.
p8
aVThat's a big airplane.
p9
aa(lp10
VFei-Fei Li: This is a three-year-old child
p11
aVdescribing what she sees in a series of photos.
p12
aVShe might still have a lot to learn about this world,
p13
aVbut she's already an expert at one very important task:
p14
aVto make sense of what she sees.
p15
aVOur society is more technologically advanced than ever.
p16
aVWe send people to the moon, we make phones that talk to us
p17
aVor customize radio stations that can play only music we like.
p18
aVYet, our most advanced machines and computers
p19
aVstill struggle at this task.
p20
aVSo I'm here today to give you a progress report
p21
aVon the latest advances in our research in computer vision,
p22
aVone of the most frontier and potentially revolutionary
p23
aVtechnologies in computer science.
p24
aa(lp25
VYes, we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves,
p26
aVbut without smart vision, they cannot really tell the difference
p27
aVbetween a crumpled paper bag on the road, which can be run over,
p28
aVand a rock that size, which should be avoided.
p29
aVWe have made fabulous megapixel cameras,
p30
aVbut we have not delivered sight to the blind.
p31
aVDrones can fly over massive land,
p32
aVbut don't have enough vision technology
p33
aVto help us to track the changes of the rainforests.
p34
aVSecurity cameras are everywhere,
p35
aVbut they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool.
p36
aVPhotos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life.
p37
aVThey're being generated at a pace that's far beyond what any human,
p38
aVor teams of humans, could hope to view,
p39
aVand you and I are contributing to that at this TED.
p40
aVYet our most advanced software is still struggling at understanding
p41
aVand managing this enormous content.
p42
aVSo in other words, collectively as a society,
p43
aVwe're very much blind,
p44
aVbecause our smartest  machines are still blind.
p45
aa(lp46
V"Why is this so hard?" you may ask.
p47
aVCameras can take pictures like this one
p48
aVby converting lights into a two-dimensional array of numbers
p49
aVknown as pixels,
p50
aVbut these are just lifeless numbers.
p51
aVThey do not carry meaning in themselves.
p52
aVJust like to hear is not the same as to listen,
p53
aVto take pictures is not the same as to see,
p54
aVand by seeing, we really mean understanding.
p55
aVIn fact, it took Mother Nature 540 million years of hard work
p56
aVto do this task,
p57
aVand much of that effort
p58
aVwent into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains,
p59
aVnot the eyes themselves.
p60
aVSo vision begins with the eyes,
p61
aVbut it truly takes place in the brain.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo for 15 years now, starting from my Ph.D. at Caltech
p64
aVand then leading Stanford's Vision Lab,
p65
aVI've been working with my mentors, collaborators and students
p66
aVto teach computers to see.
p67
aVOur research field is called computer vision and machine learning.
p68
aVIt's part of the general field of artificial intelligence.
p69
aVSo ultimately, we want to teach the machines to see just like we do:
p70
aVnaming objects, identifying people, inferring 3D geometry of things,
p71
aVunderstanding relations, emotions, actions and intentions.
p72
aVYou and I weave together entire stories of people, places and things
p73
aVthe moment we lay our gaze on them.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe first step towards this goal is to teach a computer to see objects,
p76
aVthe building block of the visual world.
p77
aVIn its simplest terms, imagine this teaching process
p78
aVas showing the computers some training images
p79
aVof a particular object, let's say cats,
p80
aVand designing a model that learns from these training images.
p81
aVHow hard can this be?
p82
aVAfter all, a cat is just a collection of shapes and colors,
p83
aVand this is what we did in the early days of object modeling.
p84
aVWe'd tell the computer algorithm in a mathematical language
p85
aVthat a cat has a round face, a chubby body,
p86
aVtwo pointy ears, and a long tail,
p87
aVand that looked all fine.
p88
aVBut what about this cat?
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVIt's all curled up.
p91
aVNow you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model.
p92
aVBut what if cats are hidden?
p93
aVWhat about these silly cats?
p94
aVNow you get my point.
p95
aVEven something as simple as a household pet
p96
aVcan present an infinite number of variations to the object model,
p97
aVand that's just one object.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo about eight years ago,
p100
aVa very simple and profound observation changed my thinking.
p101
aVNo one tells a child how to see,
p102
aVespecially in the early years.
p103
aVThey learn this through real-world experiences and examples.
p104
aVIf you consider a child's eyes
p105
aVas a pair of biological cameras,
p106
aVthey take one picture about every 200 milliseconds,
p107
aVthe average time an eye movement is made.
p108
aVSo by age three, a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures
p109
aVof the real world.
p110
aVThat's a lot of training examples.
p111
aVSo instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms,
p112
aVmy insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data
p113
aVthat a child was given through experiences
p114
aVin both quantity and quality.
p115
aa(lp116
VOnce we know this,
p117
aVwe knew we needed to collect a data set
p118
aVthat has far more images than we have ever had before,
p119
aVperhaps thousands of times more,
p120
aVand together with Professor Kai Li at Princeton University,
p121
aVwe launched the ImageNet project in 2007.
p122
aVLuckily, we didn't have to mount a camera on our head
p123
aVand wait for many years.
p124
aVWe went to the Internet,
p125
aVthe biggest treasure trove of pictures that humans have ever created.
p126
aVWe downloaded nearly a billion images
p127
aVand used crowdsourcing technology like the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform
p128
aVto help us to label these images.
p129
aVAt its peak, ImageNet was one of the biggest employers
p130
aVof the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers:
p131
aVtogether, almost 50,000 workers
p132
aVfrom 167 countries around the world
p133
aVhelped us to clean, sort and label
p134
aVnearly a billion candidate images.
p135
aVThat was how much effort it took
p136
aVto capture even a fraction of the imagery
p137
aVa child's mind takes in in the early developmental years.
p138
aa(lp139
VIn hindsight, this idea of using big data
p140
aVto train computer algorithms may seem obvious now,
p141
aVbut back in 2007, it was not so obvious.
p142
aVWe were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while.
p143
aVSome very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure,
p144
aVand we were constantly struggling for research funding.
p145
aVOnce, I even joked to my graduate students
p146
aVthat I would just reopen my dry cleaner's shop to fund ImageNet.
p147
aVAfter all, that's how I funded my college years.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo we carried on.
p150
aVIn 2009, the ImageNet project delivered
p151
aVa database of 15 million images
p152
aVacross 22,000 classes of objects and things
p153
aVorganized by everyday English words.
p154
aVIn both quantity and quality,
p155
aVthis was an unprecedented scale.
p156
aVAs an example, in the case of cats,
p157
aVwe have more than 62,000 cats
p158
aVof all kinds of looks and poses
p159
aVand across all species of domestic and wild cats.
p160
aVWe were thrilled to have put together ImageNet,
p161
aVand we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it,
p162
aVso in the TED fashion, we opened up the entire data set
p163
aVto the worldwide research community for free.
p164
aV(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VNow that we have the data to nourish our computer brain,
p167
aVwe're ready to come back to the algorithms themselves.
p168
aVAs it turned out, the wealth of information provided by ImageNet
p169
aVwas a perfect match to a particular class of machine learning algorithms
p170
aVcalled convolutional neural network,
p171
aVpioneered by Kunihiko Fukushima, Geoff Hinton, and Yann LeCun
p172
aVback in the 1970s and '80s.
p173
aVJust like the brain consists of billions of highly connected neurons,
p174
aVa basic operating unit in a neural network
p175
aVis a neuron-like node.
p176
aVIt takes input from other nodes
p177
aVand sends output to others.
p178
aVMoreover, these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes
p179
aVare organized in hierarchical layers,
p180
aValso similar to the brain.
p181
aVIn a typical neural network we use to train our object recognition model,
p182
aVit has 24 million nodes,
p183
aV140 million parameters,
p184
aVand 15 billion connections.
p185
aVThat's an enormous model.
p186
aVPowered by the massive data from ImageNet
p187
aVand the modern CPUs and GPUs to train such a humongous model,
p188
aVthe convolutional neural network
p189
aVblossomed in a way that no one expected.
p190
aVIt became the winning architecture
p191
aVto generate exciting new results in object recognition.
p192
aVThis is a computer telling us
p193
aVthis picture contains a cat
p194
aVand where the cat is.
p195
aVOf course there are more things than cats,
p196
aVso here's a computer algorithm telling us
p197
aVthe picture contains a boy and a teddy bear;
p198
aVa dog, a person, and a small kite in the background;
p199
aVor a picture of very busy things
p200
aVlike a man, a skateboard, railings, a lampost, and so on.
p201
aVSometimes, when the computer is not so confident about what it sees,
p202
aVwe have taught it to be smart enough
p203
aVto give us a safe answer instead of committing too much,
p204
aVjust like we would do,
p205
aVbut other times our computer algorithm is remarkable at telling us
p206
aVwhat exactly the objects are,
p207
aVlike the make, model, year of the cars.
p208
aa(lp209
VWe applied this algorithm to millions of Google Street View images
p210
aVacross hundreds of American cities,
p211
aVand we have learned something really interesting:
p212
aVfirst, it confirmed our common wisdom
p213
aVthat car prices correlate very well
p214
aVwith household incomes.
p215
aVBut surprisingly, car prices also correlate well
p216
aVwith crime rates in cities,
p217
aVor voting patterns by zip codes.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo wait a minute. Is that it?
p220
aVHas the computer already matched or even surpassed human capabilities?
p221
aVNot so fast.
p222
aVSo far, we have just taught the computer to see objects.
p223
aVThis is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns.
p224
aVIt's an incredible accomplishment,
p225
aVbut it's only the first step.
p226
aVSoon, another developmental milestone will be hit,
p227
aVand children begin to communicate in sentences.
p228
aVSo instead of saying this is a cat in the picture,
p229
aVyou already heard the little girl telling us this is a cat lying on a bed.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo to teach a computer to see a picture and generate sentences,
p232
aVthe marriage between big data and machine learning algorithm
p233
aVhas to take another step.
p234
aVNow, the computer has to learn from both pictures
p235
aVas well as natural language sentences
p236
aVgenerated by humans.
p237
aVJust like the brain integrates vision and language,
p238
aVwe developed a model that connects parts of visual things
p239
aVlike visual snippets
p240
aVwith words and phrases in sentences.
p241
aa(lp242
VAbout four months ago,
p243
aVwe finally tied all this together
p244
aVand produced one of the first computer vision models
p245
aVthat is capable of generating a human-like sentence
p246
aVwhen it sees a picture for the first time.
p247
aVNow, I'm ready to show you what the computer says
p248
aVwhen it sees the picture
p249
aVthat the little girl saw at the beginning of this talk.
p250
aa(lp251
V(Video) Computer: A man is standing next to an elephant.
p252
aVA large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway.
p253
aa(lp254
VFFL: Of course, we're still working hard to improve our algorithms,
p255
aVand it still has a lot to learn.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd the computer still makes mistakes.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Video) Computer: A cat lying on a bed in a blanket.
p261
aa(lp262
VFFL: So of course, when it sees too many cats,
p263
aVit thinks everything might look like a cat.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Video) Computer: A young boy is holding a baseball bat.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VFFL: Or, if it hasn't seen a toothbrush, it confuses it with a baseball bat.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Video) Computer: A man riding a horse down a street next to a building.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VFFL: We haven't taught Art 101 to the computers.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Video) Computer: A zebra standing in a field of grass.
p276
aa(lp277
VFFL: And it hasn't learned to appreciate the stunning beauty of nature
p278
aVlike you and I do.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo it has been a long journey.
p281
aVTo get from age zero to three was hard.
p282
aVThe real challenge is to go from three to 13 and far beyond.
p283
aVLet me remind you with this picture of the boy and the cake again.
p284
aVSo far, we have taught the computer to see objects
p285
aVor even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Video) Computer: A person sitting at a table with a cake.
p288
aa(lp289
VFFL: But there's so much more  to this picture
p290
aVthan just a person and a cake.
p291
aVWhat the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake
p292
aVthat's only served during Easter time.
p293
aVThe boy is wearing his favorite t-shirt
p294
aVgiven to him as a gift by his father after a trip to Sydney,
p295
aVand you and I can all tell how happy he is
p296
aVand what's exactly on his mind at that moment.
p297
aa(lp298
VThis is my son Leo.
p299
aVOn my quest for visual intelligence,
p300
aVI think of Leo constantly
p301
aVand the future world he will live in.
p302
aVWhen machines can see,
p303
aVdoctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes
p304
aVto help them to diagnose and take care of patients.
p305
aVCars will run smarter and safer on the road.
p306
aVRobots, not just humans,
p307
aVwill help us to brave the disaster zones to save the trapped and wounded.
p308
aVWe will discover new species,  better materials,
p309
aVand explore unseen frontiers with the help of the machines.
p310
aa(lp311
VLittle by little, we're giving sight to the machines.
p312
aVFirst, we teach them to see.
p313
aVThen, they help us to see better.
p314
aVFor the first time, human eyes won't be the only ones
p315
aVpondering and exploring our world.
p316
aVWe will not only use the machines for their intelligence,
p317
aVwe will also collaborate with them in ways that we cannot even imagine.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis is my quest:
p320
aVto give computers visual intelligence
p321
aVand to create a better future for Leo and for the world.
p322
