VHere's a question that matters.
p4
aa(lp5
V[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]
p6
aa(lp7
VBecause we're beginning to get all the tools together to evolve ourselves.
p8
aVAnd we can evolve bacteria and we can evolve plants
p9
aVand we can evolve animals,
p10
aVand we're now reaching a point where we really have to ask,
p11
aVis it really ethical and do we want to evolve human beings?
p12
aVAnd as you're thinking about that,
p13
aVlet me talk about that in the context of prosthetics,
p14
aVprosthetics past, present, future.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo this is the iron hand
p17
aVthat belonged to one of the German counts.
p18
aVLoved to fight, lost his arm in one of these battles.
p19
aVNo problem, he just made a suit of armor,
p20
aVput it on,
p21
aVperfect prosthetic.
p22
aVThat's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful,
p25
aVmore and more modern.
p26
aVYou can hold soft-boiled eggs.
p27
aVYou can have all types of controls, and as you're thinking about that,
p28
aVthere are wonderful people like Hugh Herr
p29
aVwho have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.
p30
aVSo the wonderful Aimee Mullins will go out and say,
p31
aVhow tall do I want to be tonight?
p32
aVOr Hugh will say what type of cliff do I want to climb?
p33
aVOr does somebody want to run a marathon, or does somebody want to ballroom dance?
p34
aVAnd as you adapt these things,
p35
aVthe interesting thing about prosthetics is they've been coming inside the body.
p36
aVSo these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees.
p37
aVThey've become artificial hips.
p38
aVAnd then they've evolved further
p39
aVto become not just nice to have
p40
aVbut essential to have.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo when you're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,
p43
aVyou're talking about something that isn't just, "I'm missing my leg,"
p44
aVit's, "if I don't have this, I can die."
p45
aVAnd at that point, a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic relationship
p46
aVwith the human body.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd four of the smartest people that I've ever met \u2014
p49
aVEd Boyden, Hugh Herr, Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander \u2014
p50
aVare working on a Center for Extreme Bionics.
p51
aVAnd the interesting thing of what you're seeing here is
p52
aVthese prosthetics now get integrated into the bone.
p53
aVThey get integrated into the skin.
p54
aVThey get integrated into the muscle.
p55
aVAnd one of the other sides of Ed
p56
aVis he's been thinking about how to connect the brain
p57
aVusing light or other mechanisms
p58
aVdirectly to things like these prosthetics.
p59
aVAnd if you can do that,
p60
aVthen you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity.
p61
aVSo how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve.
p62
aVAnd of course, if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic,
p63
aVsay with light or liquid metal,
p64
aVthen you can increase that diameter
p65
aVand you could even increase it theoretically to the point where,
p66
aVas long as you could see the muzzle flash, you could step out of the way of a bullet.
p67
aVThose are the order of magnitude of changes you're talking about.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics.
p70
aVThese are Phonak hearing aids,
p71
aVand the reason why these are so interesting
p72
aVis because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something
p73
aVfor somebody who is "disabled"
p74
aVand they become something that somebody who is "normal"
p75
aVmight want to actually have,
p76
aVbecause what this prosthetic does, which is really interesting,
p77
aVis not only does it help you hear,
p78
aVyou can focus your hearing,
p79
aVso it can hear the conversation going on over there.
p80
aVYou can have superhearing.
p81
aVYou can have hearing in 360 degrees. You can have white noise.
p82
aVYou can record, and oh, by the way, they also put a phone into this.
p83
aVSo this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone.
p84
aVAnd at that point, somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.
p85
aa(lp86
VAll of these thousands of loosely connected little pieces
p87
aVare coming together,
p88
aVand it's about time we ask the question,
p89
aVhow do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two?
p90
aVAnd for that we turn to a great philosopher
p91
aVwho was a very smart man despite being a Yankee fan.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd Yogi Berra used to say, of course, that it's very tough to make predictions,
p96
aVespecially about the future.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with,
p101
aVlet's take what's happening in the present with people like Tony Atala,
p102
aVwho is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.
p103
aVAnd maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn't having something external, titanium.
p104
aVMaybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code,
p105
aVremake your own body parts,
p106
aVbecause that's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic.
p107
aVBut while you're at it, then you can take the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.
p108
aVAnd one of the things that we've been doing
p109
aVis trying to figure out how to reprogram cells.
p110
aVAnd if you can reprogram a cell,
p111
aVthen you can change the cells in those organs.
p112
aVSo if you can change the cells in those organs,
p113
aVmaybe you make those organs more radiation-resistant.
p114
aVMaybe you make them absorb more oxygen.
p115
aVMaybe you make them more efficient
p116
aVto filter out stuff that you don't want in your body.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd over the last few weeks, George Church has been in the news a lot
p119
aVbecause he's been talking about taking one of these programmable cells
p120
aVand inserting an entire human genome
p121
aVinto that cell.
p122
aVAnd once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell,
p123
aVthen you begin to ask the question,
p124
aVwould you want to enhance any of that genome?
p125
aVDo you want to enhance a human body?
p126
aVHow would you want to enhance a human body?
p127
aVWhere is it ethical to enhance a human body
p128
aVand where is it not ethical to enhance a human body?
p129
aVAnd all of a sudden, what we're doing
p130
aVis we've got this multidimensional chess board
p131
aVwhere we can change human genetics by using viruses
p132
aVto attack things like AIDS,
p133
aVor we can change the gene code through gene therapy
p134
aVto do away with some hereditary diseases,
p135
aVor we can change the environment,
p136
aVand change the expression of those genes in the epigenome
p137
aVand pass that on to the next generations.
p138
aVAnd all of a sudden, it's not just one little bit,
p139
aVit's all these stacked little bits
p140
aVthat allow you to take little portions of it
p141
aVuntil all the portions coming together
p142
aVlead you to something that's very different.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd a lot of people are very scared by this stuff.
p145
aVAnd it does sound scary, and there are risks to this stuff.
p146
aVSo why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff?
p147
aVWhy would we really want to alter the human body
p148
aVin a fundamental way?
p149
aa(lp150
VThe answer lies in part
p151
aVwith Lord Rees,
p152
aVastronomer royal of Great Britain.
p153
aVAnd one of his favorite sayings is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.
p154
aVSo what does that mean?
p155
aVIt means if you take any one of your bodies at random,
p156
aVdrop it anywhere in the universe,
p157
aVdrop it in space, you die.
p158
aVDrop it on the Sun, you die.
p159
aVDrop it on the surface of Mercury, you die.
p160
aVDrop it near a supernova, you die.
p161
aVBut fortunately, it's only about 80 percent effective.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo as a great physicist once said,
p164
aVthere's these little upstream eddies of biology
p165
aVthat create order in this rapid torrent of entropy.
p166
aVSo as the universe dissipates energy,
p167
aVthere's these upstream eddies that create biological order.
p168
aVNow, the problem with eddies is,
p169
aVthey tend to disappear.
p170
aVThey shift. They move in rivers.
p171
aVAnd because of that, when an eddy shifts,
p172
aVwhen the Earth becomes a snowball, when the Earth becomes very hot,
p173
aVwhen the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, when you have supervolcanoes,
p174
aVwhen you have solar flares,
p175
aVwhen you have potentially extinction-level events
p176
aVlike the next election \u2014
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
Vthen all of a sudden, you can have periodic extinctions.
p181
aVAnd by the way, that's happened five times on Earth,
p182
aVand therefore it is very likely
p183
aVthat the human species on Earth is going to go extinct someday.
p184
aVNot next week,
p185
aVnot next month,
p186
aVmaybe in November, but maybe 10,000 years after that.
p187
aVAs you're thinking of the consequence of that,
p188
aVif you believe that extinctions are common and natural
p189
aVand normal and occur periodically,
p190
aVit becomes a moral imperative to diversify our species.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd it becomes a moral imperative
p193
aVbecause it's going to be really hard to live on Mars
p194
aVif we don't fundamentally modify the human body.
p195
aVRight?
p196
aVYou go from one cell,
p197
aVmom and dad coming together to make one cell,
p198
aVin a cascade to 10 trillion cells.
p199
aVWe don't know, if you change the gravity substantially,
p200
aVif the same thing will happen to create your body.
p201
aVWe do know that if you expose our bodies as they currently are
p202
aVto a lot of radiation, we will die.
p203
aVSo as you're thinking of that, you have to really redesign things
p204
aVjust to get to Mars.
p205
aVForget about the moons of Neptune or Jupiter.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,
p208
aVlet's think about life in a series of scales.
p209
aVSo Life One civilization
p210
aVis a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks.
p211
aVAnd we've been doing that for thousands of years.
p212
aVYou've got tummy tucks and you've got this and you've got that.
p213
aVYou alter your looks, and I'm told
p214
aVthat not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VSeems odd.
p219
aa(lp220
VA Life Two civilization is a different civilization.
p221
aVA Life Two civilization alters fundamental aspects of the body.
p222
aVSo you put human growth hormone in, the person grows taller,
p223
aVor you put x in and the person gets fatter or loses metabolism
p224
aVor does a whole series of things,
p225
aVbut you're altering the functions in a fundamental way.
p226
aa(lp227
VTo become an intrasolar civilization,
p228
aVwe're going to have to create a Life Three civilization,
p229
aVand that looks very different from what we've got here.
p230
aVMaybe you splice in Deinococcus radiodurans
p231
aVso that the cells can resplice after a lot of exposure to radiation.
p232
aVMaybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood
p233
aVinstead of through your lungs.
p234
aVBut you're talking about really radical redesigns,
p235
aVand one of the interesting things that's happened in the last decade
p236
aVis we've discovered a whole lot of planets out there.
p237
aVAnd some of them may be Earth-like.
p238
aVThe problem is, if we ever want to get to these planets,
p239
aVthe fastest human objects \u2014
p240
aVJuno and Voyager and the rest of this stuff \u2014
p241
aVtake tens of thousands of years
p242
aVto get from here to the nearest solar system.
p243
aVSo if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else,
p244
aVor you want to see two-sun sunsets,
p245
aVthen you're talking about something that is very different,
p246
aVbecause you have to change the timescale and the body of humans
p247
aVin ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable.
p248
aVAnd that's a Life Four civilization.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, we can't even begin to imagine what that might look like,
p251
aVbut we're beginning to get glimpses
p252
aVof instruments that might take us even that far.
p253
aVAnd let me give you two examples.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,
p256
aVand one of the things that Floyd's been doing
p257
aVis he's been playing with the basic chemistry of life.
p258
aVSo all life on this planet is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.
p259
aVAll bacteria, all plants, all animals, all humans, all cows,
p260
aVeverything else.
p261
aVAnd what Floyd did is he changed out two of those base pairs,
p262
aVso it's ATXY.
p263
aVAnd that means that you now have a parallel system to make life,
p264
aVto make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,
p265
aVthat doesn't mate with most things on Earth
p266
aVor in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.
p267
aVMaybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria.
p268
aVMaybe you make plants that are immune to all viruses.
p269
aVBut why is that so interesting?
p270
aVIt means that we are not a unique solution.
p271
aVIt means you can create alternate chemistries to us
p272
aVthat could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet
p273
aVthat could create life and heredity.
p274
aa(lp275
VThe second experiment,
p276
aVor the other implication of this experiment,
p277
aVis that all of you, all life is based on 20 amino acids.
p278
aVIf you don't substitute two amino acids,
p279
aVif you don't say ATXY, if you say ATCG + XY,
p280
aVthen you go from 20 building blocks to 172,
p281
aVand all of a sudden you've got 172 building blocks of amino acids
p282
aVto build life-forms in very different shapes.
p283
aa(lp284
VThe second experiment to think about is a really weird experiment
p285
aVthat's been taking place in China.
p286
aVSo this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads.
p287
aVRight?
p288
aVAnd why is that an interesting experiment?
p289
aVWell, think of the first heart transplants.
p290
aVOne of the things they used to do
p291
aVis they used to bring in the wife or the daughter of the donor
p292
aVso the donee could tell the doctors,
p293
aV"Do you recognize this person? Do you love this person?
p294
aVDo you feel anything for this person?"
p295
aVWe laugh about that today.
p296
aVWe laugh because we know the heart is a muscle,
p297
aVbut for hundreds of thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years,
p298
aV"I gave her my heart. She took my heart. She broke my heart."
p299
aVWe thought this was emotion
p300
aVand we thought maybe emotions were transplanted with the heart. Nope.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo how about the brain?
p303
aVTwo possible outcomes to this experiment.
p304
aVIf you can get a mouse
p305
aVthat is functional,
p306
aVthen you can see,
p307
aVis the new brain a blank slate?
p308
aVAnd boy, does that have implications.
p309
aVSecond option:
p310
aVthe new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.
p311
aVThe new mouse remembers what it's afraid of,
p312
aVremembers how to navigate the maze,
p313
aVand if that is true,
p314
aVthen you can transplant memory and consciousness.
p315
aVAnd then the really interesting question is,
p316
aVif you can transplant this, is the only input-output mechanism
p317
aVthis down here?
p318
aVOr could you transplant that consciousness into something
p319
aVthat would be very different,
p320
aVthat would last in space,
p321
aVthat would last tens of thousands of years,
p322
aVthat would be a completely redesigned body
p323
aVthat could hold consciousness for a long, long period of time?
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd let's come back to the first question:
p326
aVWhy would you ever want to do that?
p327
aVWell, I'll tell you why.
p328
aVBecause this is the ultimate selfie.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VThis is taken from six billion miles away,
p333
aVand that's Earth.
p334
aVAnd that's all of us.
p335
aVAnd if that little thing goes, all of humanity goes.
p336
aVAnd the reason you want to alter the human body
p337
aVis because you eventually want a picture that says,
p338
aVthat's us, and that's us,
p339
aVand that's us,
p340
aVbecause that's the way humanity survives long-term extinction.
p341
aVAnd that's the reason why it turns out
p342
aVit's actually unethical not to evolve the human body
p343
aVeven though it can be scary, even though it can be challenging,
p344
aVbut it's what's going to allow us to explore, live
p345
aVand get to places we can't even dream of today,
p346
aVbut which our great-great-great-great- grandchildren might someday.
p347
