VWhat's in the box?
p4
aVWhatever it is must be pretty important,
p5
aVbecause I've traveled with it, moved it,
p6
aVfrom apartment to apartment to apartment.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)

aa(lp10
V(Applause)
p11
aa(lp12
VSound familiar?
p13
aVDid you know that we Americans
p14
aVhave about three times the amount of space
p15
aVwe did 50 years ago?
p16
aVThree times.
p17
aVSo you'd think, with all this extra space,
p18
aVwe'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.
p19
aVNope.
p20
aVThere's a new industry in town,
p21
aVa 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry:
p22
aVthat of personal storage.
p23
aVSo we've got triple the space,
p24
aVbut we've become such good shoppers
p25
aVthat we need even more space.
p26
aVSo where does this lead?
p27
aVLots of credit card debt,
p28
aVhuge environmental footprints,
p29
aVand perhaps not coincidentally,
p30
aVour happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years.
p31
aa(lp32
VWell I'm here to suggest there's a better way,
p33
aVthat less might actually equal more.
p34
aVI bet most of us have experienced at some point
p35
aVthe joys of less:
p36
aVcollege \u2014 in your dorm,
p37
aVtraveling \u2014 in a hotel room,
p38
aVcamping \u2014 rig up basically nothing,
p39
aVmaybe a boat.
p40
aVWhatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things,
p41
aVthis gave you a little more freedom,
p42
aVa little more time.
p43
aVSo I'm going to suggest
p44
aVthat less stuff and less space
p45
aVare going to equal a smaller footprint.
p46
aVIt's actually a great way to save you some money.
p47
aVAnd it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org
p50
aVto further this conversation
p51
aVand to find some great solutions in this area.
p52
aVFirst up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan
p53
aVwith partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.
p54
aVI wanted it all \u2014
p55
aVhome office, sit down dinner for 10,
p56
aVroom for guests,
p57
aVand all my kite surfing gear.
p58
aVWith over 300 entries from around the world,
p59
aVI got it, my own little jewel box.
p60
aVBy buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.
p61
aVinstead of 600,
p62
aVimmediately I'm saving 200 grand.
p63
aVSmaller space is going to make for smaller utilities \u2014
p64
aVsave some more money there,
p65
aVbut also a smaller footprint.
p66
aVAnd because it's really designed
p67
aVaround an edited set of possessions \u2014 my favorite stuff \u2014
p68
aVand really designed for me,
p69
aVI'm really excited to be there.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo how can you live little?
p72
aVThree main approaches.
p73
aVFirst of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.
p74
aVWe've got to clear the arteries of our lives.
p75
aVAnd that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?
p76
aVIt's time for me to let it go.
p77
aVWe've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives,
p78
aVand we've got to learn to stem the inflow.
p79
aVWe need to think before we buy.
p80
aVAsk ourselves,
p81
aV"Is that really going to make me happier? Truly?"
p82
aVBy all means,
p83
aVwe should buy and own some great stuff.
p84
aVBut we want stuff that we're going to love for years,
p85
aVnot just stuff.
p86
aa(lp87
VSecondly, our new mantra:
p88
aVsmall is sexy.
p89
aVWe want space efficiency.
p90
aVWe want things that are designed
p91
aVfor how they're used the vast majority of the time,
p92
aVnot that rare event.
p93
aVWhy have a six burner stove
p94
aVwhen you rarely use three?
p95
aVSo we want things that nest,
p96
aVwe want things that stack, and we want it digitized.
p97
aVYou can take paperwork,
p98
aVbooks, movies,
p99
aVand you can make it disappear \u2014 it's magic.
p100
aa(lp101
VFinally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares \u2014
p102
aVa sink combined with a toilet,
p103
aVa dining table becomes a bed \u2014
p104
aVsame space,
p105
aVa little side table
p106
aVstretches out to seat 10.
p107
aVIn the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here,
p108
aVwe combine a moving wall with transformer furniture
p109
aVto get a lot out of the space.
p110
aVLook at the coffee table \u2014
p111
aVit grows in height and width
p112
aVto seat 10.
p113
aVMy office folds away,
p114
aVeasily hidden.
p115
aVMy bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.
p116
aVGuests? Move the moving wall,
p117
aVhave some fold-down guest beds.
p118
aVAnd of course, my own movie theater.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I'm not saying that we all need to live
p121
aVin 420 sq. ft.
p122
aVBut consider the benefits of an edited life.
p123
aVGo from 3,000 to 2,000,
p124
aVfrom 1,500 to 1,000.
p125
aVMost of us, maybe all of us,
p126
aVare here pretty happily for a bunch of days
p127
aVwith a couple of bags,
p128
aVmaybe a small space, a hotel room.
p129
aVSo when you go home and you walk through your front door,
p130
aVtake a second and ask yourselves,
p131
aV"Could I do with a little life editing?
p132
aVWould that give me a little more freedom?
p133
aVMaybe a little more time?"
p134
aa(lp135
VWhat's in the box?
p136
aVIt doesn't really matter.
p137
aVI know I don't need it.
p138
aVWhat's in yours?
p139
aVMaybe, just maybe,
p140
aVless might equal more.
p141
aVSo let's make room
p142
aVfor the good stuff.
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.
