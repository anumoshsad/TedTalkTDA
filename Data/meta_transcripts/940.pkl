VSo I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills
p4
aVand why this is an incredibly important,
p5
aVlong, oily, hot summer,
p6
aVand why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.
p7
aVBut before I talk about the political chemistry,
p8
aVI actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is a photograph from when I visited
p11
aVPrudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002
p12
aVto watch the Minerals Management Service
p13
aVtesting their ability
p14
aVto burn oil spills in ice.
p15
aVAnd what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,
p16
aVyou see some ice cubes,
p17
aVand you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.
p18
aVThe napalm is burning there quite nicely.
p19
aVAnd the thing is, is that
p20
aVoil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.
p21
aVWe're four percent of the world's population;
p22
aVwe use 25 percent of the world's oil production.
p23
aVAnd we don't really understand what oil is,
p24
aVuntil you check out its molecules,
p25
aVAnd you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.
p26
aVSo this is what happens as that burn gets going.
p27
aVIt takes off. It's a big woosh.
p28
aVI highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,
p29
aVbecause you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture
p30
aVon the geopolitics of oil again.
p31
aVIt'll just bake your retinas.
p32
aVSo there it is; the retinas are baking.
p33
aa(lp34
VLet me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.
p35
aVOil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
p36
aVIt starts of with the very small ones,
p37
aVwhich are one carbon, four hydrogen \u2014
p38
aVthat's methane \u2014 it just floats off.
p39
aVThen there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.
p40
aVYou've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.
p41
aVAnd it goes all the way over
p42
aVto these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,
p43
aVand they have thousands of hydrogens,
p44
aVand they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur
p45
aVand all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.
p46
aVThose are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.
p47
aVThey're very important in oil spills.
p48
aa(lp49
VLet me tell you a little bit about
p50
aVthe chemistry of oil in water.
p51
aVIt is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
p52
aVOil doesn't sink, it floats.
p53
aVIf it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
p54
aVAnd the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
p55
aVIt spreads out to be really thin,
p56
aVso you have a hard time corralling it.
p57
aVThe next thing that happens
p58
aVis the light ends evaporate,
p59
aVand some of the toxic things float into the water column
p60
aVand kill fish eggs
p61
aVand smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.
p62
aVAnd then the asphaltenes \u2014 and this is the crucial thing \u2014
p63
aVthe asphaltenes get whipped by the waves
p64
aVinto a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.
p65
aVIt triples the amount
p66
aVof oily, messy goo that you have in the water,
p67
aVand it makes it very hard to handle.
p68
aVIt also makes it very viscous.
p69
aVWhen the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,
p70
aVthere were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions
p71
aVof emulsified oil,
p72
aVwith the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.
p73
aVIt's incredibly hard to clean up.
p74
aVAnd every single oil is different when it hits water.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhen the chemistry of the oil and water
p77
aValso hits our politics,
p78
aVit's absolutely explosive.
p79
aVFor the first time, American consumers
p80
aVwill kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.
p81
aVThey have a "eureka!" moment,
p82
aVwhen we suddenly understand oil in a different context.
p83
aVSo I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,
p84
aVbecause it's really crucial to understanding
p85
aVwhy this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.
p86
aVNobody gets up in the morning and thinks,
p87
aV"Wow! I'm going to go buy
p88
aVsome three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank
p89
aVand drive happily to work."
p90
aVNo, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.
p91
aVI'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.
p92
aVThey set the prices, and I don't even know.
p93
aVI am helpless over this."
p94
aVAnd this is what happens to us at the gas pump \u2014
p95
aVand actually, gas pumps are specifically designed
p96
aVto diffuse that anger.
p97
aVYou might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,
p98
aVare designed to look like ATMs.
p99
aVI've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,
p100
aVbecause supposedly we feel good about ATMs.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVThat shows you how bad it is.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness
p105
aVcomes in because most Americans actually feel
p106
aVthat oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,
p107
aVnot of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.
p108
aVAnd the thing is, too,
p109
aVis that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,
p110
aVwhich is somewhat reasonable,
p111
aVbecause in fact, we have designed this system
p112
aVwhere, if you want to get a job,
p113
aVit's much more important to have a car that runs,
p114
aVto have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.
p115
aVAnd that's actually very perverse.
p116
aa(lp117
VNow there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,
p118
aVwhich is that we'd rather be doing anything else.
p119
aVThis is BP's gas station
p120
aVin downtown Los Angeles.
p121
aVIt is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.
p122
aV"Now," you think, "why would something so lame
p123
aVwork on people so smart?"
p124
aVWell, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,
p125
aVwe're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
p126
aVI mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.
p127
aVWe don't want to be buying oil;
p128
aVwe want to be doing something green.
p129
aVAnd we get kind of in on our own con.
p130
aVI mean \u2014 and this is funny,
p131
aVit looks funny here.
p132
aVBut in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.
p133
aVBut it's an inherent part of our energy policy,
p134
aVwhich is we don't talk about
p135
aVreducing the amount of oil that we use.
p136
aVWe talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.
p137
aVWe talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.
p138
aVAnd so, cognitive dissonance
p139
aVis part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,
p140
aVand it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.
p141
aa(lp142
VOkay, so the politics of oil
p143
aVare very moral in the United States.
p144
aVThe oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus
p145
aVof engineering and finance
p146
aVand everything else,
p147
aVbut we actually see it in very moral terms.
p148
aVThis is an early-on photograph \u2014 you can see, we had these gushers.
p149
aVEarly journalists looked at these spills,
p150
aVand they said, "This is a filthy industry."
p151
aVBut they also saw in it
p152
aVthat people were getting rich for doing nothing.
p153
aVThey weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.
p154
aVIt's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.
p155
aVBut in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,
p156
aVlong before it became funny.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.
p159
aVAnd the thing about John D. is that
p160
aVhe went into this chaotic wild-east
p161
aVof oil industry,
p162
aVand he rationalized it
p163
aVinto a vertically integrated company, a multinational.
p164
aVIt was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,
p165
aVimagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
p166
aVAnd it also the kind of root
p167
aVof how we see oil as a conspiracy.
p168
aVBut what's really amazing is that
p169
aVIda Tarbell, the journalist,
p170
aVwent in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller
p171
aVand actually got the whole antitrust laws
p172
aVput in place.
p173
aVBut in many ways,
p174
aVthat image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.
p175
aVAnd here's one of the things
p176
aVthat Ida Tarbell said \u2014
p177
aVshe said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.
p178
aVThere were no lips.
p179
aVThere were puffs under the little colorless eyes
p180
aVwith creases running from them."
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVOkay, so that guy is actually still with us.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVI mean, this is a very pervasive \u2014 this is part of our DNA.
p185
aVAnd then there's this guy, okay.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, you might be wondering why it is that,
p188
aVevery time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,
p189
aVwe call these CEOs down to Washington,
p190
aVand we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.
p191
aVAnd this is something that we've been doing since 1974,
p192
aVwhen we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"
p193
aVAnd we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry
p194
aVinto these CEOs.
p195
aVAnd we take it as, you know \u2014
p196
aVwe look at it on a moral level,
p197
aVrather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.
p198
aVAnd so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions \u2014
p199
aVI'm just saying that, when you focus on
p200
aVwhether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,
p201
aVyou don't actually get around to the point
p202
aVof making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,
p203
aVor you're going to get around
p204
aVto really reducing the amount of oil
p205
aVand reducing our dependence on oil.
p206
aVSo I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.
p207
aVBut it makes for good theater,
p208
aVand it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo the thing about water oil spills
p211
aVis that they are very politically galvanizing.
p212
aVI mean, these pictures \u2014 this is from the Santa Barbara spill.
p213
aVYou have these pictures of birds.
p214
aVThey really influence people.
p215
aVWhen the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,
p216
aVit formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
p217
aVIt started Earth Day.
p218
aVIt also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,
p219
aVthe Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.
p220
aVEverything that we are really stemmed from this period.
p221
aVI think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds
p222
aVand understand what happens to us.
p223
aVHere we are normally;
p224
aVwe're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.
p225
aVWe look at these pictures
p226
aVand we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.
p227
aVWe connect the dots in the supply chain.
p228
aVAnd we have this kind of \u2014
p229
aVas voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.
p230
aVThis is why these moments of these oil spills
p231
aVare so important.
p232
aVBut it's also really important that we don't get distracted
p233
aVby the theater or the morals of it.
p234
aVWe actually need to go in
p235
aVand work on the roots of the problem.
p236
aa(lp237
VOne of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills
p238
aVwas that we really worked on some of the symptoms.
p239
aVWe were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive
p240
aVabout what happened.
p241
aVAnd so what we did was, actually,
p242
aVwe made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.
p243
aVWe stopped drilling in ANWR,
p244
aVbut we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
p245
aVIn fact, it's continued to increase.
p246
aVThe only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume
p247
aVis much higher prices.
p248
aVAs you can see, our own production has fallen off
p249
aVas our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.
p250
aVWe only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;
p251
aV65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
p252
aa(lp253
VOne of the things that's happened because of this
p254
aVis that, since 1969,
p255
aVthe country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,
p256
aVwhich is the delta \u2014 which is two times the size of Maryland \u2014
p257
aVhas had thousands of oil spills a year.
p258
aVI mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills
p259
aVwhen we import oil from places
p260
aVwithout tight environmental regulations.
p261
aVThat has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill
p262
aVevery year since 1969.
p263
aVAnd we can wrap our heads around the spills,
p264
aVbecause that's what we see here,
p265
aVbut in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.
p266
aVThere's a thousand battle-related deaths a year
p267
aVin this area twice the size of Maryland,
p268
aVand it's all related to the oil.
p269
aVAnd these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,
p270
aVthey might be actually here in this room.
p271
aVThey have degrees in political science, degrees in business \u2014
p272
aVthey're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.
p273
aVAnd it's sort of one of the other groups of people
p274
aVwho pay a price for us.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe other thing that we've done,
p277
aVas we've continued to increase demand,
p278
aVis that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.
p279
aVOne of the places we put in a big oil project
p280
aVin Chad, with Exxon.
p281
aVSo the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;
p282
aVthe World Bank, Exxon paid for it.
p283
aVWe put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.
p284
aVI was there in 2003.
p285
aVWe were driving along this dark, dark road,
p286
aVand the guy in the green stepped out,
p287
aVand I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."
p288
aVAnd then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,
p289
aVand we realized it was okay.
p290
aVThey have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
p291
aVBut at the same time,
p292
aVChad has become much more unstable,
p293
aVand we are not paying for that price at the pump.
p294
aVWe pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.
p295
aa(lp296
VWe do the same thing
p297
aVwith the price of policing the Persian Gulf
p298
aVand keeping the shipping lanes open.
p299
aVThis is 1988 \u2014
p300
aVwe actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
p301
aVThat was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there
p302
aVthat we do not pay for at the pump.
p303
aVWe pay for it on April 15th,
p304
aVand we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.
p305
aVThe other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil
p306
aVand our increased consumption
p307
aVis the Gulf of Mexico,
p308
aVwhich was not part of the moratoriums.
p309
aVNow what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 as you can see,
p310
aVthis is the Minerals Management diagram
p311
aVof wells for gas and oil.
p312
aVIt's become this intense industrialized zone.
p313
aVIt doesn't have the same resonance for us
p314
aVthat the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,
p315
aVbut it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.
p316
aVAlso, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,
p317
aVhalf of it is actually being refined along the coast,
p318
aVbecause the Gulf actually has
p319
aVabout 50 percent of our refining capacity
p320
aVand a lot of our marine terminals as well.
p321
aVSo the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us
p322
aVthrough a less-clean environment.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd finally, American families also pay a price for oil.
p325
aVNow on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high
p326
aVwhen you consider the actual cost of the oil,
p327
aVbut on the other hand,
p328
aVthe fact that people have no other transit options
p329
aVmeans that they pay a large amount of their income
p330
aVinto just getting back and forth to work,
p331
aVgenerally in a fairly crummy car.
p332
aVIf you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,
p333
aVthey might have three jobs or more,
p334
aVand then they have to really commute.
p335
aVThey're actually spending more on their car and fuel
p336
aVthan they are on taxes or on health care.
p337
aVAnd the same thing happens
p338
aVat the 50th percentile, around 80,000.
p339
aVGasoline costs are a tremendous drain
p340
aVon the American economy,
p341
aVbut they're also a drain on individual families
p342
aVand it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:
p345
aVwhat do we have to do this time?
p346
aVWhat are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?
p347
aVOne thing is \u2014 we need to stay away from the theater.
p348
aVWe need to stay away from the moratoriums.
p349
aVWe need to focus really back again
p350
aVon the molecules.
p351
aVThe moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus
p352
aVon the molecules on the oil.
p353
aVOne of the things that we also need to do,
p354
aVis we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves
p355
aVinto thinking that you can have a green world,
p356
aVbefore you reduce the amount of oil that we use.
p357
aVWe need to focus on reducing the oil.
p358
aa(lp359
VWhat you see in this top drawing is a schematic
p360
aVof how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.
p361
aVIt comes in on the side \u2014 the useful stuff is the dark gray,
p362
aVand the un-useful stuff,
p363
aVwhich is called the rejected energy \u2014 the waste,
p364
aVgoes up to the top.
p365
aVNow you can see that the waste far outweighs
p366
aVthe actually useful amount.
p367
aVAnd one of the things that we need to do
p368
aVis, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles
p369
aVand make them much more efficient,
p370
aVbut we also need to fix the economy in general.
p371
aa(lp372
VWe need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.
p373
aVFor example, we have an insurance system
p374
aVwhere the person who drives 20,000 miles a year
p375
aVpays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.
p376
aVWe actually encourage people to drive more.
p377
aVWe have policies that reward sprawl \u2014 we have all kinds of policies.
p378
aVWe need to have more mobility choices.
p379
aVWe need to make the gas price
p380
aVbetter reflect the real cost of oil.
p381
aVAnd we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,
p382
aVwhich is at least 10 billion dollars a year,
p383
aVinto something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.
p384
aVWhether that's getting a much more efficient car
p385
aVand also kind of building markets
p386
aVfor new cars and new fuels down the road,
p387
aVthis is where we need to be.
p388
aVWe need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,
p389
aVand you can find more about this policy.
p390
aVIt's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation
p391
aVReducing Oil Needs Gradually,"
p392
aVand the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.
p393
aVThey're up at NewAmerica.net.
p394
aVWhat's important about these
p395
aVis that we try to move
p396
aVfrom feeling helpless at the pump,
p397
aVto actually being active
p398
aVand to really sort of thinking about who we are,
p399
aVhaving kind of that special moment,
p400
aVwhere we connect the dots actually at the pump.
p401
aa(lp402
VNow supposedly, oil taxes
p403
aVare the third rail of American politics \u2014 the no-fly zone.
p404
aVI actually \u2014 I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil
p405
aVis probably too much,
p406
aVbut I think that if we started this year
p407
aVwith three cents a gallon on gasoline,
p408
aVand upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,
p409
aVall the way up to 30 cents by 2020,
p410
aVthat we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,
p411
aVand at the same time we would give people time to prepare,
p412
aVtime to respond,
p413
aVand we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
p414
aVLet me give you a little sense of how this would work.
p415
aa(lp416
VThis is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.
p417
aVThe first thing that you have on the tax is \u2014
p418
aVyou have a tax for a stronger America \u2014 33 cents.
p419
aVSo you're not helpless at the pump.
p420
aVAnd the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,
p421
aVvery similar to what you would find
p422
aVon a cigarette pack.
p423
aVAnd what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences
p424
aVestimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car
