VI had brain surgery 18 years ago,
p4
aVand since that time, brain science has become
p5
aVa personal passion of mine.
p6
aVI'm actually an engineer.
p7
aVAnd first let me say, I recently joined
p8
aVGoogle's Moonshot group,
p9
aVwhere I had a division,
p10
aVthe display division in Google X,
p11
aVand the brain science work I'm speaking about today
p12
aVis work I did before I joined Google
p13
aVand on the side outside of Google.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo that said, there's a stigma
p16
aVwhen you have brain surgery.
p17
aVAre you still smart or not?
p18
aVAnd if not, can you make yourself smart again?
p19
aa(lp20
VAfter my neurosurgery,
p21
aVpart of my brain was missing,
p22
aVand I had to deal with that.
p23
aVIt wasn't the grey matter, but it  was the gooey part dead center
p24
aVthat makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.
p25
aVImmediately after my surgery,
p26
aVI had to decide what amounts of each of over
p27
aVa dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,
p28
aVbecause if I just took nothing,
p29
aVI would die within hours.
p30
aVEvery day now for 18 years \u2014 every single day \u2014
p31
aVI've had to try to decide the combinations
p32
aVand mixtures of chemicals,
p33
aVand try to get them, to stay alive.
p34
aVThere have been several close calls.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,
p37
aVso I decided I would experiment
p38
aVto try to find more optimal dosages
p39
aVbecause there really isn't a clear road map
p40
aVon this that's detailed.
p41
aVI began to try different mixtures,
p42
aVand I was blown away by how
p43
aVtiny changes in dosages
p44
aVdramatically changed my sense of self,
p45
aVmy sense of who I was, my thinking,
p46
aVmy behavior towards people.
p47
aVOne particularly dramatic case:
p48
aVfor a couple months I actually tried dosages
p49
aVand chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,
p50
aVand I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVI was angry all the time,
p53
aVI thought about sex constantly,
p54
aVand I thought I was the smartest person
p55
aVin the entire world, and
p56
aV\u2014(Laughter)\u2014
p57
aVof course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,
p58
aVor maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.
p59
aVI was kind of extreme.
p60
aVBut to me, the surprise was,
p61
aVI wasn't trying to be arrogant.
p62
aVI was actually trying,
p63
aVwith a little bit of insecurity,
p64
aVto actually fix a problem in front of me,
p65
aVand it just didn't come out that way.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo I couldn't handle it.
p68
aVI changed my dosages.
p69
aVBut that experience, I think, gave me
p70
aVa new appreciation for men
p71
aVand what they might walk through,
p72
aVand I've gotten along with men
p73
aVa lot better since then.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhat I was trying to do
p76
aVwith tuning these hormones
p77
aVand neurotransmitters and so forth
p78
aVwas to try to get my intelligence back
p79
aVafter my illness and surgery,
p80
aVmy creative thought, my idea flow.
p81
aVAnd I think mostly in images,
p82
aVand so for me that became a key metric \u2014
p83
aVhow to get these mental images
p84
aVthat I use as a way of rapid prototyping,
p85
aVif you will, my ideas,
p86
aVtrying on different new ideas for size,
p87
aVplaying out scenarios.
p88
aVThis kind of thinking isn't new.
p89
aVPhiliosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes
p90
aVsaw things similarly.
p91
aVThey thought that mental images and ideas
p92
aVwere actually the same thing.
p93
aVThere are those today that dispute that,
p94
aVand lots of debates about how the mind works,
p95
aVbut for me it's simple:
p96
aVMental images, for most of us,
p97
aVare central in inventive and creative thinking.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo after several years,
p100
aVI tuned myself up and I have lots of great,
p101
aVreally vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication
p102
aVand the analytical backbone behind them.
p103
aVAnd so now I'm working on,
p104
aVhow can I get these mental images in my mind
p105
aVout to my computer screen faster?
p106
aVCan you imagine, if you will,
p107
aVa movie director being able to use
p108
aVher imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?
p109
aVOr a musician to get the music out of his head?
p110
aVThere are incredible possibilities with this
p111
aVas a way for creative people
p112
aVto share at light speed.
p113
aVAnd the truth is, the remaining bottleneck
p114
aVin being able to do this
p115
aVis just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo let me show you why I think  we're pretty close to getting there
p118
aVby sharing with you two recent experiments
p119
aVfrom two top neuroscience groups.
p120
aVBoth used fMRI technology \u2014
p121
aVfunctional magnetic resonance imaging technology \u2014
p122
aVto image the brain,
p123
aVand here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis
p124
aVand his colleagues at Harvard.
p125
aVAnd the left-hand column shows a brain scan
p126
aVof a person looking at an image.
p127
aVThe middle column shows the brainscan
p128
aVof that same individual
p129
aVimagining, seeing that same image.
p130
aVAnd the right column was created
p131
aVby subtracting the middle  column from the left column,
p132
aVshowing the difference to be nearly zero.
p133
aVThis was repeated on lots of different individuals
p134
aVwith lots of different images,
p135
aValways with a similar result.
p136
aVThe difference between seeing an image
p137
aVand imagining seeing that same image
p138
aVis next to nothing.
p139
aa(lp140
VNext let me share with you one other experiment,
p141
aVthis from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
p142
aVThey've been able to decode brainwaves
p143
aVinto recognizable visual fields.
p144
aVSo let me set this up for you.
p145
aVIn this experiment, individuals were shown
p146
aVhundreds of hours of YouTube videos
p147
aVwhile scans were made of their brains
p148
aVto create a large library of their brain reacting
p149
aVto video sequences.
p150
aVThen a new movie was shown with new images,
p151
aVnew people, new animals in it,
p152
aVand a new scan set was recorded.
p153
aVThe computer, using brain scan data alone,
p154
aVdecoded that new brain scan
p155
aVto show what it thought the  individual was actually seeing.
p156
aVOn the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,
p157
aVand on the left-hand side, the presented clip.
p158
aVThis is the jaw-dropper.
p159
aVWe are so close to being able to do this.
p160
aVWe just need to up the resolution.
p161
aVAnd now remember that when you see an image
p162
aVversus when you imagine that same image,
p163
aVit creates the same brain scan.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo this was done with the highest-resolution
p166
aVbrain scan systems available today,
p167
aVand their resolution has increased really
p168
aVabout a thousandfold in the last several years.
p169
aVNext we need to increase the resolution
p170
aVanother thousandfold
p171
aVto get a deeper glimpse.
p172
aVHow do we do that?
p173
aVThere's a lot of techniques in this approach.
p174
aVOne way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.
p175
aVI'm not for that.
p176
aVThere's a lot of new imaging techniques
p177
aVbeing proposed, some even by me,
p178
aVbut given the recent success of MRI,
p179
aVfirst we need to ask the question,
p180
aVis it the end of the road with this technology?
p181
aVConventional wisdom says the only way
p182
aVto get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,
p183
aVbut at this point bigger magnets
p184
aVonly offer incremental resolution improvements,
p185
aVnot the thousandfold we need.
p186
aVI'm putting forward an idea:
p187
aVinstead of bigger magnets,
p188
aVlet's make better magnets.
p189
aVThere's some new technology breakthroughs
p190
aVin nanoscience
p191
aVwhen applied to magnetic structures
p192
aVthat have created a whole new class of magnets,
p193
aVand with these magnets, we can lay down
p194
aVvery fine detailed magnetic field patterns
p195
aVthroughout the brain,
p196
aVand using those, we can actually create
p197
aVholographic-like interference structures
p198
aVto get precision control over many patterns,
p199
aVas is shown here by shifting things.
p200
aVWe can create much more complicated structures
p201
aVwith slightly different arrangements,
p202
aVkind of like making Spirograph.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo why does that matter?
p205
aVA lot of effort in MRI over the years
p206
aVhas gone into making really big,
p207
aVreally huge magnets, right?
p208
aVBut yet most of the recent advances
p209
aVin resolution have actually come from
p210
aVingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions
p211
aVin the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers
p212
aVin the MRI systems.
p213
aVLet's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,
p214
aVput down structured magnetic patterns
p215
aVin addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.
p216
aVSo by combining the magnetics patterns
p217
aVwith the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies
p218
aVprocessing which can massively increase
p219
aVthe information that we can extract
p220
aVin a single scan.
p221
aVAnd on top of that, we can then layer
p222
aVour ever-growing knowledge  of brain structure and memory
p223
aVto create a thousandfold increase that we need.
p224
aVAnd using fMRI, we should be able to measure
p225
aVnot just oxygenated blood flow,
p226
aVbut the hormones and neurotransmitters  I've talked about
p227
aVand maybe even the direct neural activity,
p228
aVwhich is the dream.
p229
aa(lp230
VWe're going to be able to dump our ideas
p231
aVdirectly to digital media.
p232
aVCould you imagine if we could leapfrog language
p233
aVand communicate directly with human thought?
p234
aVWhat would we be capable of then?
p235
aVAnd how will we learn to deal
p236
aVwith the truths of unfiltered human thought?
p237
aVYou think the Internet was big.
p238
aVThese are huge questions.
p239
aVIt might be irresistible as a tool
p240
aVto amplify our thinking and communication skills.
p241
aVAnd indeed, this very same tool
p242
aVmay prove to lead to the cure
p243
aVfor Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
p244
aa(lp245
VWe have little option but to open this door.
p246
aVRegardless, pick a year \u2014
p247
aVwill it happen in five years or 15 years?
p248
aVIt's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
p249
aVWe need to learn how to take this step together.
p250
