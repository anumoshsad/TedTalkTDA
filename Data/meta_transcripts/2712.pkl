VWe all have milestones in life that we remember so vividly.
p4
aVThe first one for me was when I was entering kindergarten.
p5
aVMy big brother was in school, and by golly, it was my time.
p6
aVAnd I went trottin' down that hallway.
p7
aVI was so excited, I almost wet myself.
p8
aVAnd I go to the door,
p9
aVand there was the teacher with a warm welcome,
p10
aVand she took me into the classroom,
p11
aVshowed me my little cubbyhole \u2014
p12
aVwe all remember those little cubbyholes, don't we \u2014
p13
aVand we put our stuff in there.
p14
aVAnd then she said, "Go over to the circle
p15
aVand play with the kids until class starts."
p16
aVSo I went over there and plopped down like I owned the place,
p17
aVand I'm playing,
p18
aVand all of a sudden, the boy next to me,
p19
aVhe was wearing a white shirt with blue shorts.
p20
aVI remember it like it was yesterday.
p21
aVSuddenly he stopped playing and he said,
p22
aV"Why are you so short?"
p23
aVAnd I just kept playing. I didn't think he was talking to me.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd in a louder voice, he said,
p28
aV"Hey, why are you so short?"
p29
aVSo I looked up and I said,
p30
aV"What are you talking about? Let's just play. We're happy.
p31
aVI've been waiting for this."
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd so we played, and about a minute later,
p34
aVthe girl next to him, in a white shirt and a pink skirt,
p35
aVstood up, put her hands on her hips,
p36
aVand said, "Yeah, why do you look so different?"
p37
aVAnd I went, "What are you talking about?
p38
aVI don't look different. I'm not short. Again, let's just play."
p39
aa(lp40
VAbout this time, I looked all around the circle I was in,
p41
aVand all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me.
p42
aVAnd I'm thinking \u2014
p43
aVin today's language, it would be "OMG" or "WTF."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VWhat just happened?
p48
aa(lp49
VSo all the confidence that I went in with that morning
p50
aVwas withering away as the morning went on
p51
aVand the questions kept coming.
p52
aVAnd at the end of the morning, before I went home,
p53
aVthe teacher had us in a circle,
p54
aVand I actually found myself outside of the circle.
p55
aVI couldn't look at anybody.
p56
aVI could not understand what just happened.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd over the next few years,
p59
aVI hated to go out in public.
p60
aVI felt every stare, every giggle,
p61
aVevery pointed finger,
p62
aVnot the finger,
p63
aVbut every pointed finger,
p64
aVand I hated it.
p65
aVI would hide behind my parents' legs like nobody could see me.
p66
aVAnd as a child,
p67
aVyou can't understand another child's curiosity,
p68
aVnor an adult's ignorance.
p69
aVIt became very apparent to me that the real world was not built
p70
aVfor someone of my size, both literally or figuratively.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd so I have no anonymity, as you can probably tell,
p73
aVand while you can see my size,
p74
aVwe all go through many challenges through our lifetime.
p75
aVAnd some you can see, like mine.
p76
aVMost you can't.
p77
aVYou can't tell if someone's dealing with a mental illness,
p78
aVor they're struggling with their gender identity,
p79
aVthey're caring for an aging parent,
p80
aVthey're having financial difficulty.
p81
aVYou can't see that kind of stuff.
p82
aVSo while you can see
p83
aVone of my challenges is my size,
p84
aVseeing does not mean you understand
p85
aVwhat it's truly to be me on a daily basis, or what I go through.
p86
aVAnd so I'm here to debunk a myth.
p87
aVI do not believe you can walk in someone else's shoes,
p88
aVand because of that, we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.
p89
aVSimply stated, I will never know what it's like to be you
p90
aVand you will never know what it's like to be me.
p91
aVI cannot face your fears or chase your dreams,
p92
aVand you can't do that for me,
p93
aVbut we can be supportive of each other.
p94
aVInstead of trying to walk in each other's shoes,
p95
aVwe must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.
p96
aa(lp97
VI learned at an early age
p98
aVthat I did have to do some things different than most people,
p99
aVbut I also learned there were things I was on equal footing with,
p100
aVand one of those was the classroom.
p101
aVHeh, heh, heh. I was equal.
p102
aVAs a matter of fact, I excelled in the classroom.
p103
aVThis was vitally important, I discovered as I grew older
p104
aVand realized I wasn't going to be able to do a physical job.
p105
aVI needed an education.
p106
aVSo I went on and got a university degree,
p107
aVbut I felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment,
p108
aVI needed to have an advanced university degree,
p109
aVso I went ahead and got that.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow I'm ready for my interview.
p112
aVRemember your first interview? What am I going to wear?
p113
aVWhat questions?
p114
aVAnd don't forget that firm handshake.
p115
aVI was right there with you.
p116
aVSo 24 hours before my interview,
p117
aVa friend of mine who I've known all my life
p118
aVcalled and said, "Michele, the building you're going in has steps."
p119
aVAnd she knew I couldn't climb steps.
p120
aVSo suddenly, my focus changed.
p121
aVIn my shoes, I was worried about how am I going to get there?
p122
aVSo I went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview.
p123
aVThey had no idea what I went through for the day and that's OK.
p124
aa(lp125
VYou're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview,
p126
aVor getting in the building.
p127
aVIn reality, my biggest challenge that day
p128
aVwas getting through the loading dock without getting run over.
p129
aVI am very vulnerable in certain situations:
p130
aVairports, hallways, parking lots,
p131
aVloading docks.
p132
aVAnd so I have to be very careful.
p133
aVI have to anticipate and be flexible
p134
aVand move as quickly as I can sometimes.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo I got the job,
p137
aVand in my current role I travel quite a bit.
p138
aVAnd travel is a challenge for all of us these days.
p139
aVAnd so you probably get to the airport, run through security, get to the gate.
p140
aVDid I get my aisle seat or my window seat? Did I get my upgrade?
p141
aVMe, first of all, I don't run through anything.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd I especially don't run through the TSA
p146
aVbecause I get to experience the personal patdown.
p147
aVI won't comment on that.
p148
aVAnd then I make my way to the gate,
p149
aVand with my gift of gab that my parents said I was born with,
p150
aVI talk to the gate agent, and then I say, "By the way, my scooter weighs this much,
p151
aVI have a dry cell battery,
p152
aVand I can drive it down to the door of the plane."
p153
aVAlso, the day before, I had called the city where I'm traveling to
p154
aVto find out where I could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken on the way.
p155
aVSo in my shoes, it's a little bit different.
p156
aa(lp157
VWhen I get onto the plane,
p158
aVI use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up, and they graciously do.
p159
aVI try not to eat or drink on a plane
p160
aVbecause I don't want to have to get up and walk on the plane,
p161
aVbut nature has its own schedule,
p162
aVand not long ago, it knocked and I answered.
p163
aVSo I walked up to the front of the plane
p164
aVand gabbed with the flight attendant,
p165
aVand said, "Can you watch the door? I can't reach the lock."
p166
aVSo I'm in there doing my business, and the door flies open.
p167
aVAnd there's a gentleman there
p168
aVwith a look of horror on his face.
p169
aVI'm sure I had the same look.
p170
aVAs I came out, I noticed that he was sitting right across from me,
p171
aVand he's in total, complete embarrassment.
p172
aVSo I walk up to him and I quietly go,
p173
aV"Are you going to remember this as much as I am?"
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd he goes, "I think so."
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, while he's probably not talking about it publicly, I am.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VBut we talked for the rest of the flight,
p186
aVand we got to know each other, our families, sports, work,
p187
aVand when we landed, he said,
p188
aV"Michele, I noticed someone put your bag up.
p189
aVCan I get that for you?"
p190
aVAnd I said, "Of course, thank you."
p191
aVAnd we wished each other well,
p192
aVand the most important thing that day
p193
aVwas that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment,
p194
aVthat experience of embarrassment.
p195
aVHe won't forget it, and neither will I,
p196
aVbut I think he will remember more
p197
aVour chat and our different perspectives.
p198
aa(lp199
VWhen you travel internationally,
p200
aVit can be even more challenging in certain ways.
p201
aVA few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,
p202
aVand I come wheeling in,
p203
aVand think about that.
p204
aVShort, white, blond woman in a chair.
p205
aVThat doesn't probably happen every day.
p206
aVSo I go up, and with my gift of gab, I start to talk to the agent.
p207
aVSo friendly, and I ask about their culture and so forth,
p208
aVand I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.
p209
aVSo I had to kind of say,
p210
aV"Not only do you have to lift my chair,
p211
aVI could use some help getting up the steps."
p212
aVSo we got to spend about an hour together while we waited for the flight,
p213
aVand it was the most magnificent hour.
p214
aVOur perspective changed for both of us that day.
p215
aVAnd once I got on the flight,
p216
aVhe patted me on the back and wished me well,
p217
aVand I thanked him so much.
p218
aVAnd again, I think he's going to remember that experience more
p219
aVthan when I first came in, and there was a bit of hesitation.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd as you notice, I get a lot of help.
p222
aVI would not be where I am today
p223
aVif it was not for my family, my friends, my colleagues
p224
aVand the many strangers
p225
aVthat help me every single day of my life.
p226
aVAnd it's important that we all have a support system.
p227
aVAsking for help is a strength,
p228
aVnot a weakness.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aa(lp232
VWe all need help throughout our lifetime,
p233
aVbut it is just as important
p234
aVthat we are part of other people's support systems.
p235
aVWe must adopt that way of giving back.
p236
aVWe all obviously have a role to play in our own successes,
p237
aVbut think about the role we have to play in other people's successes,
p238
aVjust like people do for me every single day.
p239
aa(lp240
VIt's vitally important that we help each other,
p241
aVbecause society is increasingly placing people in silos
p242
aVbased on biases and ideologies.
p243
aVAnd we must look past the surface
p244
aVand be confronted with the truth
p245
aVthat none of us are what you can see.
p246
aVThere's more to us than that,
p247
aVand we're all dealing with things that you cannot see.
p248
aVSo living a life free of judgment
p249
aVallows all of us to share those experiences together
p250
aVand have a totally different perspective,
p251
aVjust like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo remember, the only shoes
p254
aVyou truly can walk in are your own.
p255
aVI cannot walk in yours.
p256
aVI know you can't walk in my size 1s \u2014
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
Vbut you can try.
p261
aVBut we can do something better than that.
p262
aVWith compassion, courage and understanding,
p263
aVwe can walk side by side
p264
aVand support one another,
p265
aVand think about how society can change
p266
aVif we all do that
p267
aVinstead of judging on only what you can see.
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you.
