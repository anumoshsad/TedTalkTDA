VGotcha.
p8
aVMosquitoes.
p9
aVI hate them.
p10
aVDon't you?
p11
aVThat awful buzzing sound at night around your ears
p12
aVthat drives you absolutely crazy?
p13
aVKnowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin
p14
aVand suck out your blood?
p15
aVThat's awful, right?
p16
aVIn fact, there's only one good thing I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.
p17
aVWhen they fly into our bedroom at night,
p18
aVthey prefer to bite my wife.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VBut that's fascinating, right?
p23
aVWhy does she receive more bites than I do?
p24
aVAnd the answer is smell,
p25
aVthe smell of her body.
p26
aVAnd since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin
p27
aVthat either attract or repel mosquitoes,
p28
aVsome of us are just more attractive than others.
p29
aVSo my wife smells nicer than I do, or I just stink more than she does.
p30
aa(lp31
VEither way, mosquitoes find us in the dark by sniffing us out. They smell us.
p32
aVAnd during my PhD, I wanted to know exactly
p33
aVwhat chemicals from our skin African malaria mosquitoes use
p34
aVto track us down at night.
p35
aVAnd there's a whole range of compounds that they do use.
p36
aVAnd this was not going to be an easy task.
p37
aVAnd therefore we set up various experiments.
p38
aVWhy did we set up these experiments?
p39
aVBecause half the world's population
p40
aVruns the risk of contracting a killer disease like malaria
p41
aVthrough a simple mosquito bite.
p42
aVEvery 30 seconds, somewhere on this planet,
p43
aVa child dies of malaria,
p44
aVand Paul Levy this morning, he was talking about the metaphor
p45
aVof the 727 crashing into the United States.
p46
aVWell, in Africa, we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s
p47
aVcrashing every day.
p48
aVBut perhaps if we can attract these mosquitoes to traps,
p49
aVbait it with our smell,
p50
aVwe may be able to stop transmission of disease.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, solving this puzzle was not an easy thing,
p53
aVbecause we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin,
p54
aVbut we undertook some remarkable experiments
p55
aVthat managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed.
p56
aa(lp57
VFirst, we observed that not all mosquito species
p58
aVbite on the same part of the body.
p59
aVStrange.
p60
aVSo we set up an experiment
p61
aVwhere we put a naked volunteer in a large cage,
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
Vand in that cage, we released mosquitoes
p66
aVto see where they were biting on the body of that person.
p67
aVAnd we found some remarkable differences.
p68
aVOn the left here you see the bites
p69
aVby the Dutch malaria mosquito on this person.
p70
aVThey had a very strong preference for biting on the face.
p71
aVIn contrast, the African malaria mosquito
p72
aVhad a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person.
p73
aVAnd that, of course, we should have known all along,
p74
aVbecause they're called mosqui-toes, you see?
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VThat's right.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so we started focusing on the smell of feet ...
p83
aVon the smell of human feet,
p84
aVuntil we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
p85
aVthat said that cheese smells after feet
p86
aVrather than the reverse.
p87
aVThink of it.
p88
aVAnd this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment.
p89
aVWe tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese,
p90
aVwhich smells badly after feet,
p91
aVto attract African malaria mosquitoes.
p92
aVAnd you know what? It worked.
p93
aVIn fact, it worked so well
p94
aVthat now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese
p95
aVthat we're using in Tanzania
p96
aVand has been shown there
p97
aVto be two to three times more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.
p98
aVLimburg, be proud of your cheese,
p99
aVas it is now used in the fight against malaria.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Applause)
p102
aa(lp103
VThat's the cheese, just to show you.
p104
aa(lp105
VMy second story is remarkable as well.
p106
aVIt's about man's best friend. It's about dogs.
p107
aVAnd I will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria.
p108
aVOne of the best ways of killing mosquitoes
p109
aVis not to wait until they fly around like adults
p110
aVand bite people and transmit disease.
p111
aVIt's to kill them when they're still in the water as larvae.
p112
aVWhy?
p113
aVBecause they are just like the CIA.
p114
aVIn that pool of water, these larvae are concentrated.
p115
aVThey're all together there. They are immobile.
p116
aVThey can't escape from that water.
p117
aVThey can't fly.
p118
aVAnd they're accessible.
p119
aVYou can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right?
p120
aa(lp121
VSo the problem that we face with this
p122
aVis that, throughout the landscape, all these pools of water with the larvae,
p123
aVthey are scattered all over the place,
p124
aVwhich makes it very hard for an inspector like this
p125
aVto actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides.
p126
aVAnd last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem?
p127
aVUntil we realized that just like us \u2014 we have a unique smell \u2014
p128
aVmosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd so we set up another crazy experiment,
p131
aVbecause we collected the smell of these larvae,
p132
aVput it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
p133
aVHere we have a bar with four holes
p134
aVand we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole.
p135
aVOh, that was very quick.
p136
aVAnd then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.
p137
aVHe's examining these holes and now he's got it already.
p138
aVHe's going back to check the control holes again,
p139
aVbut he's coming back to the first one,
p140
aVand now he's locking into that smell,
p141
aVwhich means that now, we can use dogs with these inspectors
p142
aVto much better find the breeding sites of mosquitoes in the field,
p143
aVand therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria.
p144
aVThis lady is Ellen van der Zweep.
p145
aVShe's one of the best dog trainers in the world,
p146
aVand she believes that we can do a lot more.
p147
aVSince we also know that people that carry malaria parasites
p148
aVsmell different compared to people that are uninfected,
p149
aVshe's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite.
p150
aVThat means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way
p151
aVand there's few people remaining with parasites,
p152
aVthat the dogs can find these people,
p153
aVwe can treat them with antimalarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria.
p154
aVMan's best friend in the fight against malaria.
p155
aa(lp156
VMy third story is perhaps even more remarkable ...
p157
aVand, I should say, has never been shown to the public until today.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Audience cheers)
p160
aa(lp161
VYeah.
p162
aVIt's a crazy story, but I believe it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge
p163
aVagainst mosquitoes ever.
p164
aVIn fact, people have told me
p165
aVthat now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes.
p166
aVAnd the question of course is,
p167
aVwhat would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?
p168
aVAnd the answer I have right here ...
p169
aVin my pocket \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
Vif I get it.
p174
aVIt's a tablet.
p175
aVA simple tablet,
p176
aVand when I take it with water ...
p177
aVit does miracles.
p178
aVThank you.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, let me show you how this works.
p181
aVHere in this box, I have a cage
p182
aVwith several hundred hungry female mosquitoes ...
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
Vthat I'm just about to release.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VJust kidding, just kidding.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VWhat I'm going to show you is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it
p195
aVand I will show you how quickly they will bite.
p196
aVThere we go.
p197
aVDon't worry, I do this all the time in the lab.
p198
aVThere we go.
p199
aVOK.
p200
aVNow, on the video \u2014
p201
aVon the video here,
p202
aVI'm going to show you exactly the same thing,
p203
aVexcept that what I'm showing you on the video
p204
aVhappened one hour after I took the tablet.
p205
aVHave a look.
p206
aVThat doesn't work.
p207
aVOK. Sorry about that.
p208
aVI'm sticking in my arm, I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,
p209
aVI'm shaking them off, and we follow them through time
p210
aVto see these mosquitoes get very, very sick indeed,
p211
aVhere shown in fast motion.
p212
aVAnd three hours later, what we see at the bottom of the cage
p213
aVis dead mosquitoes ...
p214
aVvery dead mosquitoes.
p215
aVAnd I'm going to say, ladies and gentlemen,
p216
aVwe have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.
p217
aVThey don't kill us. We kill them.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VNow \u2014
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aVMaastricht, be prepared.
p225
aVNow, think of what we can do with this.
p226
aVWe can actually use this to contain outbreaks
p227
aVof mosquito-born diseases, of epidemics, right?
p228
aVAnd better still, imagine what would happen
p229
aVif, in a very large area, everyone would take these drugs, for just three weeks.
p230
aVThat would give us an opportunity
p231
aVto actually eliminate malaria as a disease.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo cheese, dogs and a pill to kill mosquitoes.
p234
aVThat's the kind of out-of-the-box science that I love doing ...
p235
aVfor the betterment of mankind,
p236
aVbut especially for her,
p237
aVso that she can grow up in a world without malaria.
p238
aa(lp239
VThank you.
