VI would like to tell you all
p4
aVthat you are all actually cyborgs,
p5
aVbut not the cyborgs that you think.
p6
aVYou're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,
p7
aVbut you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen
p8
aVor use one of your cell phone devices.
p9
aVSo what's a good definition for cyborg?
p10
aVWell, traditional definition is "an organism
p11
aVto which exogenous components have been added
p12
aVfor the purpose of adapting to new environments."
p13
aVThat came from a 1960 paper on space travel,
p14
aVbecause, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
p15
aVPeople aren't supposed to be there.
p16
aVBut humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies
p17
aVso they can go to the Alps one day
p18
aVand then become a fish in the sea the next.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.
p21
aVSomebody goes to another country,
p22
aVsays, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,
p23
aVhow curious their culture is."
p24
aVAnd then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,
p25
aVand we think it's very exotic.
p26
aVWell, what's happening
p27
aVis that we've suddenly found a new species.
p28
aVI, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,
p29
aV"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,
p30
aVand look at these fascinating cultures,
p31
aVand look at these curious rituals
p32
aVthat everybody's doing around this technology.
p33
aVThey're clicking on things and staring at screens."
p34
aa(lp35
VNow there's a reason why I study this,
p36
aVversus traditional anthropology.
p37
aVAnd the reason is that tool use,
p38
aVin the beginning \u2014 for thousands and thousands of years,
p39
aVeverything has been a physical modification of self.
p40
aVIt has helped us to extend our physical selves,
p41
aVgo faster, hit things harder,
p42
aVand there's been a limit on that.
p43
aVBut now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,
p44
aVbut an extension of the mental self,
p45
aVand because of that, we're able to travel faster,
p46
aVcommunicate differently.
p47
aVAnd the other thing that happens
p48
aVis that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
p49
aVWe can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,
p50
aVand then we can take anything out.
p51
aVWhat does the inside of your computer actually look like?
p52
aVWell, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material
p53
aVthat you're carrying around all the time.
p54
aVAnd if you actually lose that information,
p55
aVit means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,
p56
aVthat you suddenly feel like something's missing,
p57
aVexcept you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe other thing that happens is that you have a second self.
p60
aVWhether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,
p61
aVand people are interacting with your second self
p62
aVwhen you're not there.
p63
aVAnd so you have to be careful
p64
aVabout leaving your front lawn open,
p65
aVwhich is basically your Facebook wall,
p66
aVso that people don't write on it in the middle of the night \u2014
p67
aVbecause it's very much the equivalent.
p68
aVAnd suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
p69
aVYou have to present yourself in digital life
p70
aVin a similar way that you would in your analog life.
p71
aVSo, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,
p72
aVyou have to learn to do that for your digital self.
p73
aVAnd the problem is that a lot of people now,
p74
aVespecially adolescents,
p75
aVhave to go through two adolescences.
p76
aVThey have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,
p77
aVand then they go through their second self's adolescence,
p78
aVand that's even more awkward
p79
aVbecause there's an actual history
p80
aVof what they've gone through online.
p81
aVAnd anybody coming in new to technology
p82
aVis an adolescent online right now,
p83
aVand so it's very awkward,
p84
aVand it's very difficult for them to do those things.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,
p87
aV"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
p88
aVAnd I said, "Great."
p89
aVAnd he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
p90
aVAnd I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."
p91
aVI thought I was very clever.
p92
aVHe said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."
p93
aVHe took a piece of paper,
p94
aVdrew A and B on one side and the other
p95
aVand folded them together so where A and B touched.
p96
aVAnd he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
p97
aVAnd I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
p98
aVHe said, "Well, you just bend time and space,
p99
aVit takes an awful lot of energy,
p100
aVand that's just how you do it."
p101
aVAnd I said, "I want to do that."
p102
aVAnd he said, "Well, okay."
p103
aVAnd so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,
p104
aVI was thinking at night,
p105
aV"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,
p106
aVto make things accelerate faster.
p107
aVAnd I want to make a time machine."
p108
aVI was always sending messages to my future self
p109
aVusing tape recorders.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut then what I realized when I went to college
p112
aVis that technology doesn't just get adopted
p113
aVbecause it works.
p114
aVIt gets adopted because people use it
p115
aVand it's made for humans.
p116
aVSo I started studying anthropology.
p117
aVAnd when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,
p118
aVI realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
p119
aVThey weren't physically transporting themselves;
p120
aVthey were mentally transporting themselves.
p121
aVThey would click on a button,
p122
aVand they would be connected as A to B immediately.
p123
aVAnd I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."
p124
aa(lp125
VSo over time, time and space
p126
aVhave compressed because of this.
p127
aVYou can stand on one side of the world,
p128
aVwhisper something and be heard on the other.
p129
aVOne of the other ideas that comes around
p130
aVis that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
p131
aVEvery single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
p132
aVAnd because of that, you start to dig around
p133
aVfor your external memories \u2014 where did you leave them?
p134
aVSo now we're all these paleontologists
p135
aVthat are digging for things that we've lost
p136
aVon our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
p137
aVAnd that incites a sort of panic architecture \u2014
p138
aV"Oh no, where's this thing?"
p139
aVWe're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,
p140
aVand we can't keep up.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd so what happens is,
p143
aVwhen we bring all that into the social space,
p144
aVwe end up checking our phones all the time.
p145
aVSo we have this thing called ambient intimacy.
p146
aVIt's not that we're always connected to everybody,
p147
aVbut at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
p148
aVAnd if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,
p149
aVthe room would be very crowded.
p150
aVThese are the people that you have access to right now, in general \u2014
p151
aVall of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.
p154
aVOne I'm really worried about
p155
aVis that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,
p156
aVand that they aren't slowing down and stopping,
p157
aVbeing around all those people in the room all the time
p158
aVthat are trying to compete for their attention
p159
aVon the simultaneous time interfaces,
p160
aVpaleontology and panic architecture.
p161
aVThey're not just sitting there.
p162
aVAnd really, when you have no external input,
p163
aVthat is a time when there is a creation of self,
p164
aVwhen you can do long-term planning,
p165
aVwhen you can try and figure out who you really are.
p166
aVAnd then, once you do that, you can figure out
p167
aVhow to present your second self in a legitimate way,
p168
aVinstead of just dealing with everything as it comes in \u2014
p169
aVand oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
p170
aVAnd so this is very important.
p171
aVI'm really worried that, especially kids today,
p172
aVthey're not going to be dealing with this down-time,
p173
aVthat they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,
p174
aVand that everything comes to them,
p175
aVand that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
p178
aVIt has its own external prosthetic devices,
p179
aVand these devices are helping us all
p180
aVto communicate and interact with each other.
p181
aVBut when you actually visualize it,
p182
aVall the connections that we're doing right now \u2014
p183
aVthis is an image of the mapping of the Internet \u2014
p184
aVit doesn't look technological.
p185
aVIt actually looks very organic.
p186
aVThis is the first time in the entire history of humanity
p187
aVthat we've connected in this way.
p188
aVAnd it's not that machines are taking over.
p189
aVIt's that they're helping us to be more human,
p190
aVhelping us to connect with each other.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe most successful technology gets out of the way
p193
aVand helps us live our lives.
p194
aVAnd really,
p195
aVit ends up being more human than technology,
p196
aVbecause we're co-creating each other all the time.
p197
aVAnd so this is the important point that I like to study:
p198
aVthat things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection \u2014
p199
aVit's just done in a different way.
p200
aVWe're just increasing our humanness
p201
aVand our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
p202
aVSo that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
