VSo I'd like you to come back with me
p4
aVjust for a few minutes
p5
aVto a dark night in China,
p6
aVthe night I met my husband.
p7
aVIt was a city so long ago that it was still called
p8
aVPeking.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I went to a party.
p11
aVI sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man
p12
aVwith owl glasses and a bow tie,
p13
aVand he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,
p14
aVthere in China specifically to study
p15
aVSino-Soviet relations.
p16
aVWhat a gift it was to the eager,
p17
aVyoung foreign correspondent that I was then.
p18
aVI'd pump him for information,
p19
aVI'm mentally scribbling notes
p20
aVfor the stories I plan to write.
p21
aVI talk to him for hours.
p22
aa(lp23
VOnly months later,
p24
aVI discover who he really was.
p25
aVHe was the China representative
p26
aVfor the American Soybean Association.
p27
aa(lp28
V"I don't understand. Soybeans?
p29
aVYou told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
p30
aa(lp31
V"Well, how long would you have talked to me
p32
aVif I told you we're in soybeans?"
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VI said, "You jerk."
p37
aVOnly jerk wasn't the word I used.
p38
aVI said, "You could've gotten me fired."
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd he said, "Let's get married."
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aV"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
p43
aVSo we did.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
V(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley
p50
aVturned out to be.
p51
aVHe was a Chinese scholar
p52
aVwho later, in his 60s,
p53
aVgot a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
p54
aVHe spoke six languages,
p55
aVhe played 15 musical instruments,
p56
aVhe was a licensed pilot,
p57
aVhe had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,
p58
aVhe was an expert in swine nutrition,
p59
aVdairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,
p60
aVand we did travel the country, and the world,
p61
aVand we did have a lot of kids.
p62
aVWe followed my job, and it seemed like
p63
aVthere was nothing that we couldn't do.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo when we found the cancer,
p66
aVit doesn't seem strange to us at all
p67
aVthat without saying a word to each other,
p68
aVwe believed that,
p69
aVif we were smart enough
p70
aVand strong enough and brave enough,
p71
aVand we worked hard enough,
p72
aVwe could keep him from dying ever.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
p75
aVThe surgeon emerged from the surgery.
p76
aVWhat'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:
p77
aV"We got it all."
p78
aVThen there was a setback when the pathologists
p79
aVlooked at the kidney cancer closely.
p80
aVIt turned out to be a rare,
p81
aVexceedingly aggressive type,
p82
aVwith a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal
p83
aVin several weeks at most.
p84
aVAnd yet, he did not die.
p85
aVMysteriously, he lived on.
p86
aVHe coached Little League for our son.
p87
aVHe built a playhouse for our daughter.
p88
aVAnd meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet
p89
aVlooking for specialists.
p90
aVI'm looking for a cure.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo a year goes by
p93
aVbefore the cancer, as cancers do,
p94
aVreappears,
p95
aVand with it comes another death sentence,
p96
aVthis time nine months.
p97
aVSo we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
p98
aVIt makes him so sick, he has to quit it,
p99
aVyet still he lives on.
p100
aVThen another year goes by.
p101
aVTwo years go by.
p102
aVMore specialists.
p103
aVWe take the kids to Italy.
p104
aVWe take the kids to Australia.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd then more years pass,
p107
aVand the cancer begins to grow.
p108
aVThis time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
p109
aVThey're exotic. They're experimental.
p110
aVThey're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
p111
aVSo he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
p112
aVThe cancer begins to shrink,
p113
aVand for the third time,
p114
aVwe've dodged death.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo now I ask you,
p117
aVhow do I feel
p118
aVwhen the time finally comes
p119
aVand there's another dark night,
p120
aVsometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
p121
aVThis time it's on the intensive care ward
p122
aVwhen a twentysomething resident
p123
aVthat I've never met before
p124
aVtells me that Terence is dying,
p125
aVperhaps tonight.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo what do I say when he says,
p128
aV"What do you want me to do?"
p129
aa(lp130
VThere's another drug out there.
p131
aVIt's newer. It's more powerful.
p132
aVHe started it just two weeks ago.
p133
aVPerhaps there's still hope ahead.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo what do I say?
p136
aa(lp137
VI say, "Keep him alive if you can."
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd Terence died six days later.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
p142
aVIt was an exhilarating fight,
p143
aVand I'd repeat the fight today
p144
aVwithout a moment's hesitation.
p145
aVWe fought together, we lived together.
p146
aVIt turned what could have been
p147
aVseven of the grimmest years of our life
p148
aVinto seven of the most glorious.
p149
aVIt was also an expensive fight.
p150
aVIt was the kind of fight and the kind of choices
p151
aVthat everyone here agrees
p152
aVpump up the cost of end-of-life care,
p153
aVand of healthcare for all of us.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd for me, for us,
p156
aVwe pushed the fight right over the edge,
p157
aVand I never got the chance to say to him
p158
aVwhat I say to him now almost every day:
p159
aV"Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
p160
aVWe never got the chance to say goodbye.
p161
aVWe never thought it was the end.
p162
aVWe always had hope.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo what do we make of all of this?
p165
aa(lp166
VBeing a journalist, after Terence died,
p167
aVI wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."
p168
aVI wrote it because I wanted to know
p169
aVwhy I did what I did,
p170
aVwhy he did what he did,
p171
aVwhy everyone around us did what they did.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd what did I discover?
p174
aVWell, one of the things I discovered is that
p175
aVexperts think that one answer to
p176
aVwhat I did at the end was a piece of paper,
p177
aVthe advance directive,
p178
aVto help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
p179
aVYet I had that piece of paper.
p180
aVWe both did.
p181
aVAnd they were readily available.
p182
aVI had them right at hand.
p183
aVBoth of them said the same thing:
p184
aVDo nothing if there is no further hope.
p185
aVI knew Terence's wishes
p186
aVas clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
p187
aa(lp188
VYet we never got to no further hope.
p189
aVEven with that clear-cut paper in our hands,
p190
aVwe just kept redefining hope.
p191
aVI believed I could keep him from dying,
p192
aVand I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen
p193
aVso many people and have talked to so many people
p194
aVwho have felt exactly the same way.
p195
aVRight up until days before his death,
p196
aVI felt strongly
p197
aVand powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,
p198
aVthat I could keep him from dying ever.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, what do the experts call this?
p201
aVThey say it's denial.
p202
aVIt's a strong word, isn't it?
p203
aVYet I will tell you that denial
p204
aVisn't even close to a strong enough word
p205
aVto describe what those of us
p206
aVfacing the death of our loved ones go through.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd I hear the medical professionals say,
p209
aV"Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,
p210
aVbut the family's in denial.
p211
aVThe family won't listen to reason.
p212
aVThey're in denial.
p213
aVHow can they insist on this treatment at the end?
p214
aVIt's so clear, yet they're in denial."
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, I think this maybe isn't
p217
aVa very useful way of thinking.
p218
aVIt's not just families either.
p219
aVThe medical professionals too,
p220
aVyou out there, you're in denial too.
p221
aVYou want to help. You want to fix.
p222
aVYou want to do.
p223
aVYou've succeeded in everything you've done,
p224
aVand having a patient die,
p225
aVwell, that must feel like failure.
p226
aa(lp227
VI saw it firsthand.
p228
aVJust days before Terence died,
p229
aVhis oncologist said,
p230
aV"Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
p231
aVDays before he died.
p232
aa(lp233
VYet Ira Byock,
p234
aVthe director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth
p235
aVsaid, "You know, the best doctor in the world
p236
aVhas never succeeded in making anyone immortal."
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what the experts call "denial," I call "hope,"
p239
aVand I'd like to borrow a phrase
p240
aVfrom my friends in software design.
p241
aVYou just redefine denial and hope,
p242
aVand it becomes a feature of being human.
p243
aVIt's not a bug.
p244
aVIt's a feature.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VSo we need to think more constructively
p249
aVabout this very common, very profound
p250
aVand very powerful human emotion.
p251
aVIt's part of the human condition,
p252
aVand yet our system and our thinking
p253
aVisn't built to accommodate it.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,
p256
aVand I believed it.
p257
aVMaybe I wanted to believe it.
p258
aVAnd during Terence's illness, I, we,
p259
aVwe wanted to believe the story
p260
aVof our fight together too.
p261
aVGiving up the fight \u2014 for that's how it felt,
p262
aVit felt like giving up \u2014
p263
aVmeant giving up not only his life
p264
aVbut also our story,
p265
aVour story of us as fighters,
p266
aVthe story of us as invincible,
p267
aVand for the doctors, the story of themselves
p268
aVas healers.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo what do we need?
p271
aa(lp272
VMaybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
p273
aVMaybe we need a new story,
p274
aVnot a story about giving up the fight
p275
aVor of hopelessness,
p276
aVbut rather a story of victory and triumph,
p277
aVof a valiant battle and, eventually,
p278
aVa graceful retreat,
p279
aVa story that acknowledges
p280
aVthat not even the greatest general defeats every foe,
p281
aVthat no doctor has ever succeeded
p282
aVin making anyone immortal,
p283
aVand that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,
p284
aVhas ever stopped even the bravest,
p285
aVwittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband
p286
aVfrom dying when it was his time to go.
p287
aa(lp288
VPeople did mention hospice,
p289
aVbut I wouldn't listen.
p290
aVHospice was for people who were dying,
p291
aVand Terence wasn't dying.
p292
aVAs a result, he spent just four days in hospice,
p293
aVwhich I'm sure, as you all know,
p294
aVis a pretty typical outcome,
p295
aVand we never said goodbye
p296
aVbecause we were unprepared for the end.
p297
aa(lp298
VWe have a noble path to curing the disease,
p299
aVpatients and doctors alike,
p300
aVbut there doesn't seem to be
p301
aVa noble path to dying.
p302
aVDying is seen as failing,
p303
aVand we had a heroic narrative
p304
aVfor fighting together,
p305
aVbut we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo maybe we need a narrative
p308
aVfor acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,
p309
aVand maybe our new story will be
p310
aVabout a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
p311
aVTerence loved poetry,
p312
aVand the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy
p313
aVis one of my favorite poets.
p314
aVSo I'll give you a couple lines from him.
p315
aVThis is a poem about Mark Antony.
p316
aVYou know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,
p317
aVCleopatra's guy?
p318
aVActually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
p319
aVAnd he's been a pretty good general.
p320
aVHe's won all the fights,
p321
aVhe's eluded all the people that are out to get him,
p322
aVand yet this time, finally,
p323
aVhe's come to the city of Alexandria
p324
aVand realized he's lost.
p325
aVThe people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
p326
aVThey're singing.
p327
aVAnd suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
p328
aVAnd he suddenly knows
p329
aVhe's been deserted by the gods,
p330
aVand it's time to let go.
p331
aVAnd the poet tells him what to do.
p332
aVHe tells him how to say a noble goodbye,
p333
aVa goodbye that's fit for a hero.
p334
aa(lp335
V"As if long-prepared,
p336
aVas if courageous,
p337
aVas it becomes you
p338
aVwho were worthy of such a city,
p339
aVapproach the window with a firm step,
p340
aVand with emotion,
p341
aVbut not with the entreaties
p342
aVor the complaints of a coward,
p343
aVas a last enjoyment,
p344
aVlisten to the sounds,
p345
aVthe exquisite instruments of the musical troops,
p346
aVand bid her farewell,
p347
aVthe Alexandria you are losing."
p348
aa(lp349
VThat's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,
p350
aVa goodbye for a man
p351
aVfor whom anything,
p352
aVwell, almost anything,
p353
aVwas possible,
p354
aVa goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd isn't that what we're missing?
p357
aVHow can we learn that people's decisions
p358
aVabout their loved ones
p359
aVare often based strongly, powerfully,
p360
aVmany times irrationally,
p361
aVon the slimmest of hopes?
p362
aVThe overwhelming presence of hope
p363
aVisn't denial.
p364
aVIt's part of our DNA as humans,
p365
aVand maybe it's time our healthcare system \u2014
p366
aVdoctors, patients, insurance companies, us,
p367
aVstarted accounting for the power of that hope.
p368
aVHope isn't a bug.
p369
aVIt's a feature.
p370
aa(lp371
VThank you.
