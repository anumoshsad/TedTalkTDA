VRight now is the most exciting time
p4
aVto see new Indian art.
p5
aVContemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world
p6
aVlike never before.
p7
aVI thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time
p8
aVcollectors here with us at TED, local collectors,
p9
aVto have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists
p10
aVI wish everyone at TED to know.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe first is Bharti Kher.
p13
aVThe central motif of Bharti's practice
p14
aVis the ready-made store-bought bindi
p15
aVthat untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,
p16
aVevery day, in an act closely associated with
p17
aVthe institution of marriage.
p18
aVBut originally the significance of the bindi
p19
aVis to symbolize the third eye
p20
aVbetween the spiritual world and the religious world.
p21
aVBharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,
p22
aVby exploding it into something spectacular.
p23
aVShe also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,
p24
aVwhich she then completely covers in bindis,
p25
aVoften with potent symbolism.
p26
aVShe says she first got started with
p27
aV10 packets of bindis,
p28
aVand then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.
p29
aa(lp30
VOur next artist, Balasubramaniam,
p31
aVreally stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,
p32
aVworking wonders with fiberglass.
p33
aVSince Bala himself will be speaking at TED
p34
aVI won't spend too much time on him here today,
p35
aVexcept to say that he really succeeds
p36
aVat making the invisible visible.
p37
aa(lp38
VBrooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh
p39
aVis known for her digital collages,
p40
aVusing Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas
p41
aVas her primary source material.
p42
aVThese comics are a fundamental way
p43
aVthat children, especially in the diaspora,
p44
aVlearn their religious and mythological folk tales.
p45
aVI, for one, was steeped in these.
p46
aVChitra basically remixes and re-titles
p47
aVthese iconic images
p48
aVto tease out some of the sexual and gender politics
p49
aVembedded in these deeply influential comics.
p50
aVAnd she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.
p51
aa(lp52
VJitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,
p53
aVsculpture, painting and installation.
p54
aVAs you can see, he's heavily influenced
p55
aVby graffiti and street art,
p56
aVand his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.
p57
aVHe really captures that sense of density
p58
aVand energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.
p59
aVHe also creates phantasmagoric sculptures
p60
aVmade of bones from cast resin.
p61
aVHere he envisions the carcass
p62
aVof an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.
p63
aa(lp64
VThis next artist, N.S. Harsha,
p65
aVactually has a studio right here in Mysore.
p66
aVHe's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
p67
aVHe creates these fine, delicate images
p68
aVwhich he then repeats on a massive scale.
p69
aVHe uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,
p70
aVwhether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,
p71
aVor in his increasingly ambitious installation work,
p72
aVhere with 192 functioning sewing machines,
p73
aVfabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.
p74
aa(lp75
VMumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya
p76
aVbuilds on her love of comic books and street art
p77
aVto comment on the roles and expectations
p78
aVof modern Indian women.
p79
aVShe too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,
p80
aVbut in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.
p81
aVIn this particular work, she actually strips out the images
p82
aVand leaves the actual text
p83
aVto reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.
p84
aa(lp85
VRaqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,
p86
aVKashmir-raised,
p87
aVand London-trained.
p88
aVHe too is reinventing the miniature tradition.
p89
aVHe creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,
p90
aVbut also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.
p91
aVHe actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work
p92
aVusing porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.
p93
aa(lp94
VI'm kind of cheating with this next artist
p95
aVsince Raqs Media Collective are really
p96
aVthree artists working together.
p97
aVRaqs are probably the foremost practitioners
p98
aVof multimedia art in India today,
p99
aVworking across photography, video and installation.
p100
aVThey frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,
p101
aVand their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.
p102
aVHere, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime
p103
aVlooking at evidence and clues embedded
p104
aVin five narratives on these five different screens,
p105
aVin which the city itself may have been the culprit.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis next artist is probably the alpha male
p108
aVof contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.
p109
aVHe was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,
p110
aVpaintings of everyday objects,
p111
aVthe stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers
p112
aVknown to every Indian.
p113
aVHe celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,
p114
aVand on a grander and grander scale,
p115
aVby incorporating them into ever more colossal
p116
aVsculptures and installations.
p117
aVAnd finally number 10, last and certainly not least,
p118
aa(lp119
VRanjani Shettar,
p120
aVwho lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,
p121
aVcreates ethereal sculptures and installations
p122
aVthat really marry the organic to the industrial,
p123
aVand brings, like Subodh, the local global.
p124
aVThese are actually wires wrapped in muslin
p125
aVand steeped in vegetable dye.
p126
aVAnd she arranges them so that the viewer
p127
aVactually has to navigate through the space,
p128
aVand interact with the objects.
p129
aVAnd light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
p130
aVShe also explores themes of consumerism,
p131
aVand the environment, such as in this work,
p132
aVwhere these basket-like objects look organic and woven,
p133
aVand are woven,
p134
aVbut with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars
p135
aVthat she found in a Bangalore junkyard.
p136
aa(lp137
V10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.
p138
aVBut I can only hope I've whet your appetite
p139
aVto go out and see and learn more
p140
aVabout the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.
p141
aVThank you very much for looking and listening.
