VI've been living in rural East Africa for about 10 years,
p4
aVand I want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty.
p5
aVI believe that the greatest failure of the human race
p6
aVis the fact that we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
p7
aVHungry, extreme poverty:
p8
aVthese often seem like gigantic, insurmountable problems,
p9
aVtoo big to solve.
p10
aVBut as a field practitioner,
p11
aVI believe these are actually very solvable problems
p12
aVif we just take the right strategies.
p13
aa(lp14
VArchimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,
p15
aVand he taught us that if we lean on the right levers,
p16
aVwe can move the world.
p17
aVIn the fight against extreme poverty, I believe there are three powerful levers
p18
aVthat we can lean on.
p19
aVThis talk is all about those levers, and why they make poverty
p20
aVa winnable fight in our lifetimes.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhat is extreme poverty?
p23
aVWhen I first moved to rural East Africa,
p24
aVI stayed overnight with a farm family.
p25
aVThey were wonderful people.
p26
aVThey invited me into their home. We sang songs together
p27
aVand ate a simple dinner.
p28
aVThey gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor.
p29
aVIn the morning, however, there was nothing to eat.
p30
aVAnd then at lunchtime, I watched with an increasingly sick feeling
p31
aVas the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
p32
aVFor that meal, every child drank one cup to survive.
p33
aVAnd I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt
p34
aVwhen they handed one of those cups to me,
p35
aVand I knew I had to accept their hospitality.
p36
aa(lp37
VChildren need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally.
p38
aVEvery day they fail to eat, they lose a little bit of their future.
p39
aVAmongst the extreme poor, one in three children
p40
aVare permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough.
p41
aVWhen that's combined with poor access to health care,
p42
aVone in 10 extremely poor children die before they reach age five.
p43
aVAnd only one quarter of children complete high school
p44
aVbecause they lack school fees.
p45
aVHunger and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way.
p46
aVWe see ourselves as a thinking, feeling and moral human race,
p47
aVbut until we solve these problems for all of our members,
p48
aVwe fail that standard,
p49
aVbecause every person on this planet matters.
p50
aVThis child matters.
p51
aVThese children matter.
p52
aVThis girl matters.
p53
aa(lp54
VYou know, we see things like this,
p55
aVand we're upset by them,
p56
aVbut they seem like such big problems.
p57
aVWe don't know how to take effective action.
p58
aVBut remember our friend Archimedes.
p59
aVGlobal poverty has powerful levers.
p60
aVIt's a problem like any other.
p61
aVI live and work in the field, and as a practitioner,
p62
aVI believe these are very solvable problems.
p63
aVSo for the next 10 minutes,
p64
aVlet's not be sad about the state of the world.
p65
aVLet's engage our brains.
p66
aVLet's engage our collective passion for problem-solving
p67
aVand figure out what those levers are.
p68
aa(lp69
VLever number one: most of the world's poor are farmers.
p70
aVThink about how extraordinary this is.
p71
aVIf this picture represents the world's poor,
p72
aVthen more than half engage in farming as a major source of income.
p73
aVThis gets me really excited.
p74
aVAll of these people, one profession.
p75
aVThink how powerful this is.
p76
aVWhen farmers become more productive, then more than half the world's poor
p77
aVearn more money and climb out of poverty.
p78
aVAnd it gets better.
p79
aVThe product of farming is, of course, food.
p80
aVSo when farmers become more productive, they earn more food,
p81
aVand they don't just help themselves,
p82
aVbut they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies.
p83
aVAnd when farmers become more productive, they reduce environmental pressure.
p84
aVWe only have two ways we can feed the world:
p85
aVwe can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive,
p86
aVor we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland,
p87
aVwhich would be environmentally disastrous.
p88
aVFarmers are basically a really important leverage point.
p89
aVWhen farmers become more productive,
p90
aVthey earn more income, they climb out of poverty,
p91
aVthey feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure.
p92
aVFarmers stand at the center of the world.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd not a farmer like this one,
p95
aVbut rather this lady.
p96
aVMost of the farmers I know are actually women.
p97
aVLook at the strength and the will radiating from this woman.
p98
aVShe is physically strong, mentally tough,
p99
aVand she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children.
p100
aVIf we're going to put the future of humanity in one person's hands,
p101
aVthen I'm really glad it's her.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VThere's just one problem:
p106
aVmany smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
p107
aVCurrently, they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year,
p108
aVthey plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
p109
aVThese are tools and techniques that date to the Bronze Age,
p110
aVand it's why many farmers are still very poor.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut good news, again.
p113
aVLever number two:
p114
aVhumanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago.
p115
aVLet me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming.
p116
aVFirst, hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together.
p117
aVIf you naturally pollinate a high-yielding variety
p118
aVtogether with a drought-resistant variety,
p119
aVyou get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents.
p120
aVNext, conventional fertilizer, if used responsibly,
p121
aVis environmentally sustainable.
p122
aVIf you micro-dose just a pinch of fertilizer
p123
aVto a plant that's taller than I am,
p124
aVyou unlock enormous yield gain.
p125
aVThese are known as farm inputs.
p126
aVFarm inputs need to be combined with good practice.
p127
aVWhen you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost,
p128
aVfarmers multiply their harvests.
p129
aVThese proven tools and practices have more than tripled
p130
aVagricultural productivity in every major region of the world,
p131
aVmoving mass numbers of people out of poverty.
p132
aVWe just haven't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet,
p133
aVparticularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo overall, this is amazing news.
p136
aVHumanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago,
p137
aVin theory.
p138
aVWe just haven't delivered these things to everybody just yet.
p139
aVIn this century, the reason that people remain poor
p140
aVis because maybe they live in remote places.
p141
aVThey lack access to these things.
p142
aVTherefore, ending poverty is simply a matter
p143
aVof delivering proven goods and services to people.
p144
aVWe don't need more genius types right now.
p145
aVThe humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo these are the three levers,
p148
aVand the most powerful lever is simply delivery.
p149
aVWherever the world's companies, governments and nonprofits
p150
aVset up delivery networks for life-improving goods,
p151
aVwe eliminate poverty.
p152
aa(lp153
VOK, so that sounds really nice in theory,
p154
aVbut what about in practice?
p155
aVWhat do these delivery networks look like?
p156
aVI want to share the concrete example that I know best,
p157
aVmy organization, One Acre Fund.
p158
aVWe only serve the farmer,
p159
aVand our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed.
p160
aVWe start off by delivering farm inputs to really rural places.
p161
aVNow, this may appear initially very challenging,
p162
aVbut it's pretty possible. Let me show you.
p163
aVWe buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network,
p164
aVand store it in 20 warehouses like this.
p165
aVThen, during input delivery, we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks
p166
aVand send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field.
p167
aVThey then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms.
p168
aVIt's kind of like Amazon for rural farmers.
p169
aVImportantly, realistic delivery also includes finance, a way to pay.
p170
aVFarmers pay us little by little over time, covering most of our expenses.
p171
aVAnd then we surround all that with training.
p172
aVOur rural field officers deliver practical, hands-on training
p173
aVto farmers in the field
p174
aVevery two weeks.
p175
aa(lp176
VWherever we deliver our services, farmers use these tools
p177
aVto climb out of poverty.
p178
aVThis is a farmer in our program, Consolata.
p179
aVLook at the pride on her face.
p180
aVShe has achieved a modest prosperity that I believe is the human right
p181
aVof every hardworking person on the planet.
p182
aVToday, I'm proud to say that we're serving about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VThe key to doing this is scalable delivery.
p187
aVIn any given area, we hire a rural field officer
p188
aVwho delivers our services to 200 farmers, on average,
p189
aVwith more than 1,000 people living in those families.
p190
aVToday, we have 2,000 of these rural field officers
p191
aVgrowing very quickly.
p192
aVThis is our delivery army,
p193
aVand we're just one organization.
p194
aVThere are many companies, governments and nonprofits
p195
aVthat have delivery armies just like this.
p196
aVAnd I believe we stand at a moment in time
p197
aVwhere collectively, we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers.
p198
aa(lp199
VLet me show you how possible this is.
p200
aVThis is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,
p201
aVwith a map of the United States for scale.
p202
aVI chose Sub-Saharan Africa because this is a huge delivery territory.
p203
aVIt's very challenging.
p204
aVBut we analyzed every 50-mile by 50-mile block on the continent,
p205
aVand we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions.
p206
aVThat's a remarkably small area overall.
p207
aVIf you were to lay these boxes next to each other
p208
aVwithin a map of the United States,
p209
aVthey would only cover the Eastern United States.
p210
aVYou can order pizza anywhere in this territory
p211
aVand it'll arrive to your house hot, fresh and delicious.
p212
aVIf America can deliver pizza to an area of this size,
p213
aVthen Africa's companies, governments and non-profits
p214
aVcan deliver farm services to all of her farmers.
p215
aVThis is possible.
p216
aa(lp217
VI'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming.
p218
aVIn every field of human development,
p219
aVhumanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty.
p220
aVWe just need to deliver them.
p221
aVSo again, in every area of human development,
p222
aVsuper-smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive,
p223
aVhighly effective tools.
p224
aVHumanity is armed to the teeth
p225
aVwith simple, effective solutions to poverty.
p226
aVWe just need to deliver these to a pretty small area.
p227
aVAgain using the map of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,
p228
aVremember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
p229
aVUrban poverty is even more concentrated, in these green little dots.
p230
aVAgain, using a map of the United States for scale,
p231
aVthis is what I would call a highly achievable delivery zone.
p232
aVIn fact, for the first time in human history,
p233
aVwe have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us.
p234
aVThe world's companies, governments and non-profits
p235
aVhave delivery armies that are fully capable
p236
aVof covering this relatively small area.
p237
aVWe just lack the will.
p238
aa(lp239
VIf we are willing,
p240
aVevery one of us has a role to play.
p241
aVWe first need more people to pursue careers in human development,
p242
aVespecially if you live in a developing nation.
p243
aVWe need more front line health workers, teachers, farmer trainers,
p244
aVsales agents for life-improving goods.
p245
aVThese are the delivery people that dedicate their careers
p246
aVto improving the lives of others.
p247
aVBut we also need a lot of support roles.
p248
aVThese are roles available at just my organization alone,
p249
aVand we're just one out of many.
p250
aVThis may surprise you, but no matter what your technical specialty,
p251
aVthere is a role for you in this fight.
p252
aVAnd no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty,
p253
aVwe need a lot more resources.
p254
aVThis is our number one constraint.
p255
aVFor private investors, we need a big expansion of venture capital,
p256
aVprivate equity, working capital, available in emerging markets.
p257
aVBut there are also limits to what private business can accomplish.
p258
aVPrivate businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor,
p259
aVso philanthropy still has a major role to play.
p260
aVAnybody can give, but we need more leadership.
p261
aVWe need more visionary philanthropists
p262
aVand global leaders who will take problems in human development
p263
aVand lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet.
p264
aVIf you're interested in these ideas, check out this website.
p265
aa(lp266
VWe need more leaders.
p267
aVHumanity has put people on the moon.
p268
aVWe've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets
p269
aVand connect us with anybody on the planet.
p270
aVWe've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace.
p271
aVWe are an exceptional people.
p272
aVBut we've left more than one billion of our members behind.
p273
aVUntil every girl like this one has an opportunity
p274
aVto earn her full human potential,
p275
aVwe have failed to become a truly moral and just human race.
p276
aVLogistically speaking, it's incredibly possible
p277
aVto end extreme poverty.
p278
aVWe just need to deliver proven goods and services
p279
aVto everybody.
p280
aVIf we have the will, every one of us has a role to play.
p281
aVLet's deploy our time, our careers,
p282
aVour collective wealth.
p283
aVLet us deliver an end to extreme poverty
p284
aVin this lifetime.
p285
