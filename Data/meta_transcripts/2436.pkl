VSo you go to the doctor and get some tests.
p4
aVThe doctor determines that you have high cholesterol
p5
aVand you would benefit from medication to treat it.
p6
aVSo you get a pillbox.
p7
aVYou have some confidence,
p8
aVyour physician has some confidence that this is going to work.
p9
aVThe company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA.
p10
aVThey studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it.
p11
aVThey have a rough idea of how it works,
p12
aVthey have a rough idea of what the side effects are.
p13
aVIt should be OK.
p14
aVYou have a little more of a conversation with your physician
p15
aVand the physician is a little worried because you've been blue,
p16
aVhaven't felt like yourself,
p17
aVyou haven't been able to enjoy things in life quite as much as you usually do.
p18
aVYour physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression.
p19
aVI'm going to have to give you another pill."
p20
aa(lp21
VSo now we're talking about two medications.
p22
aVThis pill also \u2014 millions of people have taken it,
p23
aVthe company did studies, the FDA looked at it \u2014 all good.
p24
aVThink things should go OK.
p25
aVThink things should go OK.
p26
aVWell, wait a minute.
p27
aVHow much have we studied these two together?
p28
aa(lp29
VWell, it's very hard to do that.
p30
aVIn fact, it's not traditionally done.
p31
aVWe totally depend on what we call "post-marketing surveillance,"
p32
aVafter the drugs hit the market.
p33
aVHow can we figure out if bad things are happening
p34
aVbetween two medications?
p35
aVThree? Five? Seven?
p36
aVAsk your favorite person who has several diagnoses
p37
aVhow many medications they're on.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhy do I care about this problem?
p40
aVI care about it deeply.
p41
aVI'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion,
p42
aVthe only hope \u2014 only hope \u2014 to understand these interactions
p43
aVis to leverage lots of different sources of data
p44
aVin order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely
p45
aVand when it's not so safe.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo let me tell you a data science story.
p48
aVAnd it begins with my student Nick.
p49
aVLet's call him "Nick," because that's his name.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VNick was a young student.
p54
aVI said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work
p55
aVand how they work together and how they work separately,
p56
aVand we don't have a great understanding.
p57
aVBut the FDA has made available an amazing database.
p58
aVIt's a database of adverse events.
p59
aVThey literally put on the web \u2014
p60
aVpublicly available, you could all download it right now \u2014
p61
aVhundreds of thousands of adverse event reports
p62
aVfrom patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists.
p63
aVAnd these reports are pretty simple:
p64
aVit has all the diseases that the patient has,
p65
aVall the drugs that they're on,
p66
aVand all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.
p67
aVIt is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today,
p68
aVbut it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I said to Nick,
p71
aV"Let's think about glucose.
p72
aVGlucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.
p73
aVLet's see if we can understand glucose response.
p74
aVI sent Nick off. Nick came back.
p75
aa(lp76
V"Russ," he said,
p77
aV"I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug
p78
aVbased on looking at this database,
p79
aVand can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not."
p80
aa(lp81
VHe did it. It was very simple, in a way.
p82
aVHe took all the drugs that were known to change glucose
p83
aVand a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose,
p84
aVand said, "What's the difference in their side effects?
p85
aVDifferences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?"
p86
aVAll those things conspired to give him a really good predictor.
p87
aVHe said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy
p88
aVwhen a drug will change glucose."
p89
aa(lp90
VI said, "Nick, that's great."
p91
aVHe's a young student, you have to build his confidence.
p92
aV"But Nick, there's a problem.
p93
aVIt's that every physician in the world knows all the drugs that change glucose,
p94
aVbecause it's core to our practice.
p95
aVSo it's great, good job, but not really that interesting,
p96
aVdefinitely not publishable."
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VHe said, "I know, Russ. I thought you might say that."
p101
aVNick is smart.
p102
aV"I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment.
p103
aVI looked at people in this database who were on two drugs,
p104
aVand I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals,
p105
aVfor people taking two drugs,
p106
aVwhere each drug alone did not change glucose,
p107
aVbut together I saw a strong signal."
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd I said, "Oh! You're clever. Good idea. Show me the list."
p110
aVAnd there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting.
p111
aVBut what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs:
p112
aVparoxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant;
p113
aVand pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd I said, "Huh. There are millions of Americans on those two drugs."
p116
aVIn fact, we learned later,
p117
aV15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin,
p118
aVand a million, we estimated, on both.
p119
aVSo that's a million people
p120
aVwho might be having some problems with their glucose
p121
aVif this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database
p122
aVactually holds up.
p123
aVBut I said, "It's still not publishable,
p124
aVbecause I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo,
p125
aVwith the machine learning,
p126
aVbut it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have."
p127
aVSo we have to do something else.
p128
aVLet's go into the Stanford electronic medical record.
p129
aVWe have a copy of it that's OK for research,
p130
aVwe removed identifying information.
p131
aVAnd I said, "Let's see if people on these two drugs
p132
aVhave problems with their glucose."
p133
aa(lp134
VNow there are thousands and thousands of people
p135
aVin the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin.
p136
aVBut we needed special patients.
p137
aVWe needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement,
p138
aVthen got the second one and had another glucose measurement,
p139
aVall within a reasonable period of time \u2014 something like two months.
p140
aVAnd when we did that, we found 10 patients.
p141
aVHowever, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose
p142
aVwhen they got the second P \u2014 we call this P and P \u2014
p143
aVwhen they got the second P.
p144
aVEither one could be first, the second one comes up,
p145
aVglucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter.
p146
aVJust as a reminder,
p147
aVyou walk around normally, if you're not diabetic,
p148
aVwith a glucose of around 90.
p149
aVAnd if it gets up to 120, 125,
p150
aVyour doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes.
p151
aVSo a 20 bump \u2014 pretty significant.
p152
aa(lp153
VI said, "Nick, this is very cool.
p154
aVBut, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper,
p155
aVbecause this is 10 patients and \u2014 give me a break \u2014
p156
aVit's not enough patients."
p157
aa(lp158
VSo we said, what can we do?
p159
aVAnd we said, let's call our friends at Harvard and Vanderbilt,
p160
aVwho also \u2014 Harvard in Boston, Vanderbilt in Nashville,
p161
aVwho also have electronic medical records similar to ours.
p162
aVLet's see if they can find similar patients
p163
aVwith the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements
p164
aVin that range that we need.
p165
aa(lp166
VGod bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients,
p167
aVsame trend.
p168
aVHarvard found 100 patients, same trend.
p169
aVSo at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers
p170
aVthat were telling us that patients getting these two drugs
p171
aVwere having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
p172
aa(lp173
VMore interestingly, we had left out diabetics,
p174
aVbecause diabetics already have messed up glucose.
p175
aVWhen we looked at the glucose of diabetics,
p176
aVit was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.
p177
aVThis was a big deal, and we said, "We've got to publish this."
p178
aVWe submitted the paper.
p179
aVIt was all data evidence,
p180
aVdata from the FDA, data from Stanford,
p181
aVdata from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard.
p182
aVWe had not done a single real experiment.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut we were nervous.
p185
aVSo Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab.
p186
aVWe found somebody who knew about lab stuff.
p187
aVI don't do that.
p188
aVI take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes.
p189
aVThey taught us how to feed mice drugs.
p190
aVWe took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine.
p191
aVWe gave some other mice pravastatin.
p192
aVAnd we gave a third group of mice both of them.
p193
aVAnd lo and behold, glucose went up 20 to 60 milligrams per deciliter
p194
aVin the mice.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo the paper was accepted based on the informatics evidence alone,
p197
aVbut we added a little note at the end,
p198
aVsaying, oh by the way, if you give these to mice, it goes up.
p199
aa(lp200
VThat was great, and the story could have ended there.
p201
aVBut I still have six and a half minutes.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we were sitting around thinking about all of this,
p206
aVand I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said,
p207
aV"I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs
p208
aVare noticing side effects of hyperglycemia.
p209
aVThey could and they should.
p210
aVHow would we ever determine that?"
p211
aa(lp212
VWe said, well, what do you do?
p213
aVYou're taking a medication, one new medication or two,
p214
aVand you get a funny feeling.
p215
aVWhat do you do?
p216
aVYou go to Google
p217
aVand type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking,
p218
aVand you type in "side effects."
p219
aVWhat are you experiencing?
p220
aVSo we said OK,
p221
aVlet's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us,
p222
aVso that we can look at the search logs
p223
aVand see if patients are doing these kinds of searches.
p224
aVGoogle, I am sorry to say, denied our request.
p225
aVSo I was bummed.
p226
aVI was at a dinner with a colleague who works at Microsoft Research
p227
aVand I said, "We wanted to do this study,
p228
aVGoogle said no, it's kind of a bummer."
p229
aVHe said, "Well, we have the Bing searches."
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VYeah.
p234
aVThat's great.
p235
aVNow I felt like I was \u2014
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VI felt like I was talking to Nick again.
p240
aVHe works for one of the largest companies in the world,
p241
aVand I'm already trying to make him feel better.
p242
aVBut he said, "No, Russ \u2014 you might not understand.
p243
aVWe not only have Bing searches,
p244
aVbut if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google,
p245
aVYahoo, Bing, any ...
p246
aVThen, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only."
p247
aVI said, "Now you're talking!"
p248
aVThis was Eric Horvitz, my friend at Microsoft.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo we did a study
p251
aVwhere we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in
p252
aVif they're having hyperglycemia,
p253
aVlike "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" \u2014
p254
aVforgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in.
p255
aVSo we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words."
p256
aVAnd we did first a baseline.
p257
aVAnd it turns out that about .5 to one percent
p258
aVof all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.
p259
aVSo that's our baseline rate.
p260
aVIf people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" \u2014 those are synonyms \u2014
p261
aVand one of those words,
p262
aVthe rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words,
p263
aVif you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
p264
aVIf it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.
p265
aVIf both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query,
p266
aVit goes up to 10 percent,
p267
aVa huge three- to four-fold increase
p268
aVin those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in,
p269
aVand diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words.
p270
aa(lp271
VWe published this,
p272
aVand it got some attention.
p273
aVThe reason it deserves attention
p274
aVis that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly
p275
aVthrough their searches.
p276
aVWe brought this to the attention of the FDA.
p277
aVThey were interested.
p278
aVThey have set up social media surveillance programs
p279
aVto collaborate with Microsoft,
p280
aVwhich had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others,
p281
aVto look at Twitter feeds,
p282
aVto look at Facebook feeds,
p283
aVto look at search logs,
p284
aVto try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together,
p285
aVare causing problems.
p286
aa(lp287
VWhat do I take from this? Why tell this story?
p288
aVWell, first of all,
p289
aVwe have now the promise of big data and medium-sized data
p290
aVto help us understand drug interactions
p291
aVand really, fundamentally, drug actions.
p292
aVHow do drugs work?
p293
aVThis will create and has created a new ecosystem
p294
aVfor understanding how drugs work and to optimize their use.
p295
aVNick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now.
p296
aVHe did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs.
p297
aVHe found several very important interactions,
p298
aVand so we replicated this
p299
aVand we showed that this is a way that really works
p300
aVfor finding drug-drug interactions.
p301
aa(lp302
VHowever, there's a couple of things.
p303
aVWe don't just use pairs of drugs at a time.
p304
aVAs I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs.
p305
aVHave they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction?
p306
aVYes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D,
p307
aVbut what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together,
p308
aVbeing taken by the same patient,
p309
aVperhaps interacting with each other
p310
aVin ways that either makes them more effective or less effective
p311
aVor causes side effects that are unexpected?
p312
aVWe really have no idea.
p313
aVIt's a blue sky, open field for us to use data
p314
aVto try to understand the interaction of drugs.
p315
aa(lp316
VTwo more lessons:
p317
aVI want you to think about the power that we were able to generate
p318
aVwith the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions
p319
aVthrough their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors,
p320
aVthe people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt,
p321
aVto be used for research.
p322
aVPeople are worried about data.
p323
aVThey're worried about their privacy and security \u2014 they should be.
p324
aVWe need secure systems.
p325
aVBut we can't have a system that closes that data off,
p326
aVbecause it is too rich of a source
p327
aVof inspiration, innovation and discovery
p328
aVfor new things in medicine.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd the final thing I want to say is,
p331
aVin this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story.
p332
aVThe two drugs actually caused problems.
p333
aVThey increased glucose.
p334
aVThey could throw somebody into diabetes
p335
aVwho would otherwise not be in diabetes,
p336
aVand so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together,
p337
aVperhaps not together,
p338
aVmake different choices when you're prescribing.
p339
aVBut there was another possibility.
p340
aVWe could have found two drugs or three drugs
p341
aVthat were interacting in a beneficial way.
p342
aVWe could have found new effects of drugs
p343
aVthat neither of them has alone,
p344
aVbut together, instead of causing a side effect,
p345
aVthey could be a new and novel treatment
p346
aVfor diseases that don't have treatments
p347
aVor where the treatments are not effective.
p348
aVIf we think about drug treatment today,
p349
aVall the major breakthroughs \u2014
p350
aVfor HIV, for tuberculosis, for depression, for diabetes \u2014
p351
aVit's always a cocktail of drugs.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd so the upside here,
p354
aVand the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day,
p355
aVis how can we use the same data sources
p356
aVto find good effects of drugs in combination
p357
aVthat will provide us new treatments,
p358
aVnew insights into how drugs work
p359
aVand enable us to take care of our patients even better?
p360
