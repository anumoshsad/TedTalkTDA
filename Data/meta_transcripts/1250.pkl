VGood afternoon.
p4
aVIf you have followed
p5
aVdiplomatic news in the past weeks,
p6
aVyou may have heard of a kind of crisis
p7
aVbetween China and the U.S.
p8
aVregarding cyberattacks
p9
aVagainst the American company Google.
p10
aVMany things have been said about this.
p11
aVSome people have called a cyberwar
p12
aVwhat may actually be
p13
aVjust a spy operation \u2014
p14
aVand obviously, a quite mishandled one.
p15
aVHowever, this episode reveals
p16
aVthe growing anxiety in the Western world
p17
aVregarding these emerging cyber weapons.
p18
aa(lp19
VIt so happens that these weapons are dangerous.
p20
aVThey're of a new nature:
p21
aVthey could lead the world
p22
aVinto a digital conflict
p23
aVthat could turn into an armed struggle.
p24
aVThese virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.
p25
aVIn 1982, in the middle of the Cold War
p26
aVin Soviet Siberia,
p27
aVa pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,
p28
aVthe equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.
p29
aVNow we know today \u2014 this was revealed
p30
aVby Thomas Reed,
p31
aVRonald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary \u2014
p32
aVthis explosion was actually the result
p33
aVof a CIA sabotage operation,
p34
aVin which they had managed
p35
aVto infiltrate the IT management systems
p36
aVof that pipeline.
p37
aa(lp38
VMore recently, the U.S. government revealed
p39
aVthat in September 2008, more than 3 million people
p40
aVin the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil
p41
aVwere plunged into darkness,
p42
aVvictims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.
p43
aVEven more worrying for the Americans,
p44
aVin December 2008 the holiest of holies,
p45
aVthe IT systems of CENTCOM,
p46
aVthe central command
p47
aVmanaging the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
p48
aVmay have been infiltrated by hackers
p49
aVwho used these:
p50
aVplain but infected USB keys.
p51
aVAnd with these keys, they may have been able
p52
aVto get inside CENTCOM's systems,
p53
aVto see and hear everything,
p54
aVand maybe even infect some of them.
p55
aVAs a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.
p56
aVI'll quote General James Cartwright,
p57
aVVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
p58
aVwho says in a report to Congress
p59
aVthat cyberattacks could be as powerful as
p60
aVweapons of mass destruction.
p61
aVMoreover, the Americans have decided
p62
aVto spend over 30 billion dollars
p63
aVin the next five years
p64
aVto build up their cyberwar capabilities.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd across the world today, we see
p67
aVa sort of cyber arms race,
p68
aVwith cyberwar units
p69
aVbuilt up by countries like North Korea
p70
aVor even Iran.
p71
aVYet, what you'll never hear
p72
aVfrom spokespeople
p73
aVfrom the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence
p74
aVis that the question isn't really
p75
aVwho's the enemy, but actually
p76
aVthe very nature of cyber weapons.
p77
aVAnd to understand why, we must look at how,
p78
aVthrough the ages, military technologies
p79
aVhave maintained or destroyed
p80
aVworld peace.
p81
aVFor example,
p82
aVif we'd had TEDxParis
p83
aV350 years ago,
p84
aVwe would have talked about the military innovation of the day \u2014
p85
aVthe massive Vauban-style fortifications \u2014
p86
aVand we could have predicted
p87
aVa period of stability in the world or in Europe.
p88
aVwhich was indeed the case in Europe
p89
aVbetween 1650 and 1750.
p90
aa(lp91
VSimilarly, if we'd had this talk
p92
aV30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen
p93
aVhow the rise of nuclear weapons,
p94
aVand the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,
p95
aVprevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.
p96
aVHowever, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,
p97
aVwe would have seen how the emergence
p98
aVof new aircraft and tank technologies,
p99
aVwhich give the advantage to the attacker,
p100
aVmake the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible
p101
aVand thus create the possibility of war in Europe.
p102
aVSo military technologies
p103
aVcan influence the course of the world,
p104
aVcan make or break world peace \u2014
p105
aVand there lies the issue with cyber weapons.
p106
aa(lp107
VThe first issue:
p108
aVImagine a potential enemy announcing
p109
aVthey're building a cyberwar unit,
p110
aVbut only for their country's defense.
p111
aVOkay, but what distinguishes it
p112
aVfrom an offensive unit?
p113
aVIt gets even more complicated
p114
aVwhen the doctrines of use become ambiguous.
p115
aVJust 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France
p116
aVwere saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,
p117
aVstrictly to defend their IT systems.
p118
aVBut today both countries say
p119
aVthe best defense is to attack.
p120
aVAnd so, they're joining China,
p121
aVwhose doctrine of use for 15 years has been
p122
aVboth defensive and offensive.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe second issue:
p125
aVYour country could be under cyberattack
p126
aVwith entire regions plunged into total darkness,
p127
aVand you may not even know
p128
aVwho's attacking you.
p129
aVCyber weapons have this peculiar feature:
p130
aVthey can be used
p131
aVwithout leaving traces.
p132
aVThis gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,
p133
aVbecause the defender
p134
aVdoesn't know who to fight back against.
p135
aVAnd if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,
p136
aVthey risk making one more enemy
p137
aVand ending up diplomatically isolated.
p138
aVThis issue isn't just theoretical.
p139
aa(lp140
VIn May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,
p141
aVthat damaged its communication
p142
aVand banking systems.
p143
aVEstonia accused Russia.
p144
aVBut NATO, though it defends Estonia,
p145
aVreacted very prudently. Why?
p146
aVBecause NATO couldn't be 100% sure
p147
aVthat the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.
p148
aVSo to sum up, on the one hand,
p149
aVwhen a possible enemy announces
p150
aVthey're building a cyberwar unit,
p151
aVyou don't know whether it's for attack
p152
aVor defense.
p153
aVOn the other hand,
p154
aVwe know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.
p155
aa(lp156
VIn a major article published in 1978,
p157
aVProfessor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York
p158
aVdescribed a model to understand
p159
aVhow conflicts could arise.
p160
aVIn this context,
p161
aVwhen you don't know if the potential enemy
p162
aVis preparing for defense or attack,
p163
aVand if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,
p164
aVthen this environment is
p165
aVmost likely to spark a conflict.
p166
aVThis is the environment that's being created
p167
aVby cyber weapons today,
p168
aVand historically it was the environment in Europe
p169
aVat the onset of World War I.
p170
aVSo cyber weapons
p171
aVare dangerous by nature,
p172
aVbut in addition, they're emerging
p173
aVin a much more unstable environment.
p174
aa(lp175
VIf you remember the Cold War,
p176
aVit was a very hard game,
p177
aVbut a stable one played only by two players,
p178
aVwhich allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.
p179
aVToday we're moving to a multipolar world
p180
aVin which coordination is much more complicated,
p181
aVas we have seen at Copenhagen.
p182
aVAnd this coordination may become even trickier
p183
aVwith the introduction of cyber weapons.
p184
aVWhy? Because no nation
p185
aVknows for sure whether its neighbor
p186
aVis about to attack.
p187
aVSo nations may live under the threat
p188
aVof what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling
p189
aVcalled the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack,"
p190
aVas I don't know if my neighbor
p191
aVis about to attack me or not \u2014
p192
aVI may never know \u2014
p193
aVso I might take the upper hand
p194
aVand attack first.
p195
aa(lp196
VJust last week,
p197
aVin a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,
p198
aVit was revealed for the first time that
p199
aVofficials at the National Security Agency
p200
aVwere considering the possibility of preemptive attacks
p201
aVin cases where the U.S. was about
p202
aVto be cyberattacked.
p203
aVAnd these preemptive attacks
p204
aVmight not just remain
p205
aVin cyberspace.
p206
aVIn May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,
p207
aVcommander of the U.S. nuclear forces,
p208
aVstated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,
p209
aVall options would be on the table.
p210
aa(lp211
VCyber weapons do not replace
p212
aVconventional or nuclear weapons \u2014
p213
aVthey just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.
p214
aVBut in doing so, they also add their own risk
p215
aVof triggering a conflict \u2014
p216
aVas we've just seen, a very important risk \u2014
p217
aVand a risk we may have to confront
p218
aVwith a collective security solution
p219
aVwhich includes all of us:
p220
aVEuropean allies, NATO members,
p221
aVour American friends and allies,
p222
aVour other Western allies,
p223
aVand maybe, by forcing their hand a little,
p224
aVour Russian and Chinese partners.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe information technologies
p227
aVJoël de Rosnay was talking about,
p228
aVwhich were historically born from military research,
p229
aVare today on the verge of developing
p230
aVan offensive capability of destruction,
p231
aVwhich could tomorrow, if we're not careful,
p232
aVcompletely destroy world peace.
