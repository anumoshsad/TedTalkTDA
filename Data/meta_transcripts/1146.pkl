VThink about your day for a second.
p4
aVYou woke up, felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door,
p5
aVencountered new colleagues and had great discussions,
p6
aVand felt in awe when you found something new.
p7
aVBut I bet there's something you didn't think about today \u2014
p8
aVsomething so close to home
p9
aVthat you probably don't think about it very often at all.
p10
aVAnd that's that all the sensations, feelings,
p11
aVdecisions and actions
p12
aVare mediated by the computer in your head
p13
aVcalled the brain.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow the brain may not look like much from the outside \u2014
p16
aVa couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,
p17
aVamorphous \u2014
p18
aVbut the last hundred years of neuroscience
p19
aVhave allowed us to zoom in on the brain,
p20
aVand to see the intricacy of what lies within.
p21
aVAnd they've told us that this brain
p22
aVis an incredibly complicated circuit
p23
aVmade out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons.
p24
aVNow unlike a human-designed computer,
p25
aVwhere there's a fairly small number of different parts \u2014
p26
aVwe know how they work, because we humans designed them \u2014
p27
aVthe brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells,
p28
aVmaybe tens of thousands.
p29
aVThey come in different shapes; they're made out of different molecules.
p30
aVAnd they project and connect to different brain regions,
p31
aVand they also change different ways in different disease states.
p32
aa(lp33
VLet's make it concrete.
p34
aVThere's a class of cells,
p35
aVa fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell, that quiets its neighbors.
p36
aVIt's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia.
p37
aVIt's called the basket cell.
p38
aVAnd this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell
p39
aVthat we are learning about.
p40
aVNew ones are being discovered everyday.
p41
aVAs just a second example:
p42
aVthese pyramidal cells, large cells,
p43
aVthey can span a significant fraction of the brain.
p44
aVThey're excitatory.
p45
aVAnd these are some of the cells
p46
aVthat might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy.
p47
aVEvery one of these cells
p48
aVis an incredible electrical device.
p49
aVThey receive input from thousands of upstream partners
p50
aVand compute their own electrical outputs,
p51
aVwhich then, if they pass a certain threshold,
p52
aVwill go to thousands of downstream partners.
p53
aVAnd this process, which takes just a millisecond or so,
p54
aVhappens thousands of times a minute
p55
aVin every one of your 100 billion cells,
p56
aVas long as you live
p57
aVand think and feel.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo how are we going to figure out what this circuit does?
p60
aVIdeally, we could go through the circuit
p61
aVand turn these different kinds of cell on and off
p62
aVand see whether we could figure out
p63
aVwhich ones contribute to certain functions
p64
aVand which ones go wrong in certain pathologies.
p65
aVIf we could activate cells, we could see what powers they can unleash,
p66
aVwhat they can initiate and sustain.
p67
aVIf we could turn them off,
p68
aVthen we could try and figure out what they're necessary for.
p69
aVAnd that's a story I'm going to tell you about today.
p70
aVAnd honestly, where we've gone through over the last 11 years,
p71
aVthrough an attempt to find ways
p72
aVof turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain
p73
aVon and off,
p74
aVboth to understand the science
p75
aVand also to confront some of the issues
p76
aVthat face us all as humans.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow before I tell you about the technology,
p79
aVthe bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room,
p80
aVif we live long enough,
p81
aVwill encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.
p82
aVAlready, a billion people
p83
aVhave had some kind of brain disorder
p84
aVthat incapacitates them,
p85
aVand the numbers don't do it justice though.
p86
aVThese disorders \u2014 schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,
p87
aVdepression, addiction \u2014
p88
aVthey not only steal our time to live, they change who we are.
p89
aVThey take our identity and change our emotions
p90
aVand change who we are as people.
p91
aVNow in the 20th century,
p92
aVthere was some hope that was generated
p93
aVthrough the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders,
p94
aVand while many drugs have been developed
p95
aVthat can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders,
p96
aVpractically none of them can be considered to be cured.
p97
aVAnd part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical.
p98
aVThis elaborate circuit
p99
aVmade out of thousands of different kinds of cell
p100
aVis being bathed in a substance.
p101
aVThat's also why, perhaps, most of the drugs, and not all, on the market
p102
aVcan present some kind of serious side effect too.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow some people have gotten some solace
p105
aVfrom electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain.
p106
aVAnd for Parkinson's disease,
p107
aVCochlear implants,
p108
aVthese have indeed been able
p109
aVto bring some kind of remedy
p110
aVto people with certain kinds of disorder.
p111
aVBut electricity also will go in all directions \u2014
p112
aVthe path of least resistance,
p113
aVwhich is where that phrase, in part, comes from.
p114
aVAnd it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix.
p115
aVSo again, we're sent back to the idea
p116
aVof ultra-precise control.
p117
aVCould we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go?
p118
aa(lp119
VSo when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago,
p120
aVI had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist,
p121
aVand the first thing I thought about was,
p122
aVif these neurons are electrical devices,
p123
aVall we need to do is to find some way
p124
aVof driving those electrical changes at a distance.
p125
aVIf we could turn on the electricity in one cell,
p126
aVbut not its neighbors,
p127
aVthat would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells,
p128
aVfigure out what they do and how they contribute
p129
aVto the networks in which they're embedded.
p130
aVAnd also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need
p131
aVin order to fix the circuit computations
p132
aVthat have gone awry.
p133
aVNow how are we going to do that?
p134
aVWell there are many molecules that exist in nature,
p135
aVwhich are able to convert light into electricity.
p136
aVYou can think of them as little proteins
p137
aVthat are like solar cells.
p138
aVIf we can install these molecules in neurons somehow,
p139
aVthen these neurons would become electrically drivable with light.
p140
aVAnd their neighbors, which don't have the molecule, would not.
p141
aVThere's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen,
p142
aVand that's the ability to get light into the brain.
p143
aVAnd to do that \u2014 the brain doesn't feel pain \u2014 you can put \u2014
p144
aVtaking advantage of all the effort
p145
aVthat's gone into the Internet and communications and so on \u2014
p146
aVoptical fibers connected to lasers
p147
aVthat you can use to activate, in animal models for example,
p148
aVin pre-clinical studies,
p149
aVthese neurons and to see what they do.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo how do we do this?
p152
aVAround 2004,
p153
aVin collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,
p154
aVthis vision came to fruition.
p155
aVThere's a certain alga that swims in the wild,
p156
aVand it needs to navigate towards light
p157
aVin order to photosynthesize optimally.
p158
aVAnd it senses light with a little eye-spot,
p159
aVwhich works not unlike how our eye works.
p160
aVIn its membrane, or its boundary,
p161
aVit contains little proteins
p162
aVthat indeed can convert light into electricity.
p163
aVSo these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.
p164
aVAnd each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
p165
aVWhen blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole
p166
aVand allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot,
p167
aVand that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal
p168
aVjust like a solar cell charging up a battery.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what we need to do is to take these molecules
p171
aVand somehow install them in neurons.
p172
aVAnd because it's a protein,
p173
aVit's encoded for in the DNA of this organism.
p174
aVSo all we've got to do is take that DNA,
p175
aVput it into a gene therapy vector, like a virus,
p176
aVand put it into neurons.
p177
aVSo it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy,
p178
aVand lots of viruses were coming along.
p179
aVSo this turned out to be very simple to do.
p180
aVAnd early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004,
p181
aVwe gave it a try, and it worked on the first try.
p182
aVYou take this DNA and you put it into a neuron.
p183
aVThe neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery
p184
aVto fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins
p185
aVand install them all over the cell,
p186
aVlike putting solar panels on a roof,
p187
aVand the next thing you know,
p188
aVyou have a neuron which can be activated with light.
p189
aVSo this is very powerful.
p190
aa(lp191
VOne of the tricks you have to do
p192
aVis to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want
p193
aVand not all the other neighbors.
p194
aVAnd you can do that; you can tweak the viruses
p195
aVso they hit just some cells and not others.
p196
aVAnd there's other genetic tricks you can play
p197
aVin order to get light-activated cells.
p198
aVThis field has now come to be known as optogenetics.
p199
aVAnd just as one example of the kind of thing you can do,
p200
aVyou can take a complex network,
p201
aVuse one of these viruses to deliver the gene
p202
aVjust to one kind of cell in this dense network.
p203
aVAnd then when you shine light on the entire network,
p204
aVjust that cell type will be activated.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo for example, lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier \u2014
p207
aVthe one that's atrophied in schizophrenia
p208
aVand the one that is inhibitory.
p209
aVIf we can deliver that gene to these cells \u2014
p210
aVand they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene, of course \u2014
p211
aVand then flash blue light over the entire brain network,
p212
aVjust these cells are going to be driven.
p213
aVAnd when the light turns off, these cells go back to normal,
p214
aVso they don't seem to be averse against that.
p215
aVNot only can you use this to study what these cells do,
p216
aVwhat their power is in computing in the brain,
p217
aVbut you can also use this to try to figure out \u2014
p218
aVwell maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells,
p219
aVif indeed they're atrophied.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow I want to tell you a couple of short stories
p222
aVabout how we're using this,
p223
aVboth at the scientific, clinical and pre-clinical levels.
p224
aVOne of the questions we've confronted
p225
aVis, what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward?
p226
aVBecause if you could find those,
p227
aVthose would be some of the signals that could drive learning.
p228
aVThe brain will do more of whatever got that reward.
p229
aVAnd also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction.
p230
aVSo if we could figure out what cells they are,
p231
aVwe could maybe find new targets
p232
aVfor which drugs could be designed or screened against,
p233
aVor maybe places where electrodes could be put in
p234
aVfor people who have very severe disability.
p235
aVSo to do that, we came up with a very simple paradigm
p236
aVin collaboration with the Fiorella group,
p237
aVwhere one side of this little box,
p238
aVif the animal goes there, the animal gets a pulse of light
p239
aVin order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light.
p240
aVSo if these cells can mediate reward,
p241
aVthe animal should go there more and more.
p242
aVAnd so that's what happens.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there,
p245
aVand he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that.
p246
aVAnd he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times.
p247
aVThese are the dopamine neurons,
p248
aVwhich some of you may have heard about, in some of the pleasure centers in the brain.
p249
aVNow we've shown that a brief activation of these
p250
aVis enough, indeed, to drive learning.
p251
aVNow we can generalize the idea.
p252
aVInstead of one point in the brain,
p253
aVwe can devise devices that span the brain,
p254
aVthat can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns \u2014
p255
aVarrays of optical fibers,
p256
aVeach coupled to its own independent miniature light source.
p257
aVAnd then we can try to do things in vivo
p258
aVthat have only been done to-date in a dish \u2014
p259
aVlike high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain
p260
aVfor the signals that can cause certain things to happen.
p261
aVOr that could be good clinical targets
p262
aVfor treating brain disorders.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd one story I want to tell you about
p265
aVis how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014
p266
aVa form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear.
p267
aVAnd one of the things that we did
p268
aVwas to adopt a very classical model of fear.
p269
aVThis goes back to the Pavlovian days.
p270
aVIt's called Pavlovian fear conditioning \u2014
p271
aVwhere a tone ends with a brief shock.
p272
aVThe shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.
p273
aVAnd over time \u2014 in this case, a mouse,
p274
aVwhich is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments \u2014
p275
aVthe animal learns to fear the tone.
p276
aVThe animal will react by freezing,
p277
aVsort of like a deer in the headlights.
p278
aVNow the question is, what targets in the brain can we find
p279
aVthat allow us to overcome this fear?
p280
aVSo what we do is we play that tone again
p281
aVafter it's been associated with fear.
p282
aVBut we activate targets in the brain, different ones,
p283
aVusing that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide,
p284
aVin order to try and figure out which targets
p285
aVcan cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear.
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd so this brief video
p288
aVshows you one of these targets that we're working on now.
p289
aVThis is an area in the prefrontal cortex,
p290
aVa region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states.
p291
aVAnd the animal's going to hear a tone \u2014 and a flash of light occurred there.
p292
aVThere's no audio on this, but you can see the animal's freezing.
p293
aVThis tone used to mean bad news.
p294
aVAnd there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner,
p295
aVso you can see the animal is about two minutes into this.
p296
aVAnd now this next clip
p297
aVis just eight minutes later.
p298
aVAnd the same tone is going to play, and the light is going to flash again.
p299
aVOkay, there it goes. Right now.
p300
aVAnd now you can see, just 10 minutes into the experiment,
p301
aVthat we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area
p302
aVto overcome the expression
p303
aVof this fear memory.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow over the last couple of years, we've gone back to the tree of life
p306
aVbecause we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off.
p307
aVIf we could do that, this could be extremely powerful.
p308
aVIf you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds,
p309
aVyou can figure out what necessary role they play
p310
aVin the circuits in which they're embedded.
p311
aVAnd we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life \u2014
p312
aVevery kingdom of life except for animals, we see slightly differently.
p313
aVAnd we found all sorts of molecules, they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,
p314
aVthat respond to green and yellow light.
p315
aVAnd they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before
p316
aVwith the blue light activator channelrhodopsin.
p317
aa(lp318
VLet's give an example of where we think this is going to go.
p319
aVConsider, for example, a condition like epilepsy,
p320
aVwhere the brain is overactive.
p321
aVNow if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,
p322
aVone of the strategies is to remove part of the brain.
p323
aVBut that's obviously irreversible, and there could be side effects.
p324
aVWhat if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time,
p325
aVuntil the seizure dies away,
p326
aVand cause the brain to be restored to its initial state \u2014
p327
aVsort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state.
p328
aVSo this animation just tries to explain this concept
p329
aVwhere we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light,
p330
aVand we beam light in,
p331
aVand just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure,
p332
aVwe're hoping to be able to turn it off.
p333
aVAnd so we don't have data to show you on this front,
p334
aVbut we're very excited about this.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow I want to close on one story,
p337
aVwhich we think is another possibility \u2014
p338
aVwhich is that maybe these molecules, if you can do ultra-precise control,
p339
aVcan be used in the brain itself
p340
aVto make a new kind of prosthetic, an optical prosthetic.
p341
aVI already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon.
p342
aVSeventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted.
p343
aVMaybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants,
p344
aVwhich allow them to hear.
p345
aVThere's another thing, which is you've got to get these genes into cells.
p346
aVAnd new hope in gene therapy has been developed
p347
aVbecause viruses like the adeno-associated virus,
p348
aVwhich probably most of us around this room have,
p349
aVand it doesn't have any symptoms,
p350
aVwhich have been used in hundreds of patients
p351
aVto deliver genes into the brain or the body.
p352
aVAnd so far, there have not been serious adverse events
p353
aVassociated with the virus.
p354
aa(lp355
VThere's one last elephant in the room, the proteins themselves,
p356
aVwhich come from algae and bacteria and fungi,
p357
aVand all over the tree of life.
p358
aVMost of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains,
p359
aVso what is our brain going to do if we put that in?
p360
aVAre the cells going to tolerate it? Will the immune system react?
p361
aVIn its early days \u2014 these have not been done on humans yet \u2014
p362
aVbut we're working on a variety of studies
p363
aVto try and examine this,
p364
aVand so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity
p365
aVto these molecules
p366
aVor to the illumination of the brain with light.
p367
aVSo it's early days, to be upfront, but we're excited about it.
p368
aa(lp369
VI wanted to close with one story,
p370
aVwhich we think could potentially
p371
aVbe a clinical application.
p372
aVNow there are many forms of blindness
p373
aVwhere the photoreceptors,
p374
aVour light sensors that are in the back of our eye, are gone.
p375
aVAnd the retina, of course, is a complex structure.
p376
aVNow let's zoom in on it here, so we can see it in more detail.
p377
aVThe photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top,
p378
aVand then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors
p379
aVare transformed by various computations
p380
aVuntil finally that layer of cells at the bottom, the ganglion cells,
p381
aVrelay the information to the brain,
p382
aVwhere we see that as perception.
p383
aVIn many forms of blindness, like retinitis pigmentosa,
p384
aVor macular degeneration,
p385
aVthe photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed.
p386
aVNow how could you repair this?
p387
aVIt's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored,
p388
aVbecause there's nothing for the drug to bind to.
p389
aVOn the other hand, light can still get into the eye.
p390
aVThe eye is still transparent and you can get light in.
p391
aVSo what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules
p392
aVand install them on some of these other spare cells
p393
aVand convert them into little cameras.
p394
aVAnd because there's so many of these cells in the eye,
p395
aVpotentially, they could be very high-resolution cameras.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo this is some work that we're doing.
p398
aVIt's being led by one of our collaborators,
p399
aVAlan Horsager at USC,
p400
aVand being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience,
p401
aVwhich is funded by the NIH.
p402
aVAnd what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze.
p403
aVIt's a six-arm maze. And there's a bit of water in the maze
p404
aVto motivate the mouse to move, or he'll just sit there.
p405
aVAnd the goal, of course, of this maze
p406
aVis to get out of the water and go to a little platform
p407
aVthat's under the lit top port.
p408
aVNow mice are smart, so this mouse solves the maze eventually,
p409
aVbut he does a brute-force search.
p410
aVHe's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform.
p411
aVSo he's not using vision to do it.
p412
aVThese different mice are different mutations
p413
aVthat recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans.
p414
aVAnd so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models
p415
aVso we come up with a generalized approach.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo how are we going to solve this?
p418
aVWe're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide.
p419
aVWe're going to take these blue light photosensors
p420
aVand install them on a layer of cells
p421
aVin the middle of the retina in the back of the eye
p422
aVand convert them into a camera \u2014
p423
aVjust like installing solar cells all over those neurons
p424
aVto make them light sensitive.
p425
aVLight is converted to electricity on them.
p426
aVSo this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment
p427
aVand received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus.
p428
aVAnd now you can see, the animal can indeed avoid walls
p429
aVand go to this little platform
p430
aVand make cognitive use of its eyes again.
p431
aVAnd to point out the power of this:
p432
aVthese animals are able to get to that platform
p433
aVjust as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives.
p434
aVSo this pre-clinical study, I think,
p435
aVbodes hope for the kinds of things
p436
aVwe're hoping to do in the future.
p437
aa(lp438
VTo close, I want to point out that we're also exploring
p439
aVnew business models for this new field of neurotechnology.
p440
aVWe're developing these tools,
p441
aVbut we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world,
p442
aVso people can study and try to treat different disorders.
p443
aVAnd our hope is that, by figuring out brain circuits
p444
aVat a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them,
p445
aVwe can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier,
p446
aVpractically none of which are cured,
p447
aVand in the 21st century make them history.
p448
aa(lp449
VThank you.

aa(lp453
VJuan Enriquez: So some of the stuff is a little dense.
p454
aV(Laughter)
p455
aVBut the implications
p456
aVof being able to control seizures or epilepsy
p457
aVwith light instead of drugs,
p458
aVand being able to target those specifically
p459
aVis a first step.
p460
aVThe second thing that I think I heard you say
p461
aVis you can now control the brain in two colors,
p462
aVlike an on/off switch.
p463
aa(lp464
VEd Boyden: That's right.
p465
aa(lp466
VJE: Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code.
p467
aa(lp468
VEB: Right, yeah.
p469
aVSo with blue light, we can drive information, and it's in the form of a one.
p470
aVAnd by turning things off, it's more or less a zero.
p471
aVSo our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors
p472
aVthat work with the brain
p473
aVso we can augment functions in people with disabilities.
p474
aa(lp475
VJE: And in theory, that means that,
p476
aVas a mouse feels, smells,
p477
aVhears, touches,
p478
aVyou can model it out as a string of ones and zeros.
p479
aa(lp480
VEB: Sure, yeah. We're hoping to use this as a way of testing
p481
aVwhat neural codes can drive certain behaviors
p482
aVand certain thoughts and certain feelings,
p483
aVand use that to understand more about the brain.
p484
aa(lp485
VJE: Does that mean that some day you could download memories
p486
aVand maybe upload them?
p487
aa(lp488
VEB: Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard.
p489
aVWe're now working on some work
p490
aVwhere we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too.
p491
aVSo we can record information and then drive information back in \u2014
p492
aVsort of computing what the brain needs
p493
aVin order to augment its information processing.
p494
aa(lp495
VJE: Well, that might change a couple things. Thank you. (EB: Thank you.)
