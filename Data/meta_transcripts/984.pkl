VThis technology
p4
aVmade a very important impact on us.
p5
aVIt changed the way our history developed.
p6
aVBut it's a technology so pervasive,
p7
aVso invisible,
p8
aVthat we, for a long time,
p9
aVforgot to take it into account
p10
aVwhen we talked about
p11
aVhuman evolution.
p12
aVBut we see the results of this technology, still.
p13
aVSo let's make a little test.
p14
aVSo everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.
p15
aVTurn and face your neighbors.
p16
aVPlease, also on the balcony.
p17
aVSmile. Smile. Open the mouths.
p18
aVSmile, friendly.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVDo you \u2014
p21
aVDo you see any Canine teeth?
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVCount Dracula teeth
p24
aVin the mouths of your neighbors?
p25
aVOf course not.
p26
aVBecause our dental anatomy
p27
aVis actually made,
p28
aVnot for tearing down raw meat from bones
p29
aVor chewing fibrous leaves for hours.
p30
aVIt is made for a diet
p31
aVwhich is soft, mushy,
p32
aVwhich is reduced in fibers,
p33
aVwhich is very easily chewable
p34
aVand digestible.
p35
aVSounds like fast food, doesn't it.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VIt's for cooked food.
p40
aVWe carry in our face the proof
p41
aVthat cooking,
p42
aVfood transformation,
p43
aVmade us what we are.
p44
aVSo I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.
p45
aVWe talk about ourselves as omnivores.
p46
aVI would say, we should call ourselves coctivors \u2014
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVfrom coquere, to cook.
p49
aVWe are the animals
p50
aVwho eat cooked food.
p51
aVNo, no, no, no. Better \u2014
p52
aVto live of cooked food.
p53
aVSo cooking is a very important technology.
p54
aVIt's technology.
p55
aVI don't know how you feel,
p56
aVbut I like to cook for entertainment.
p57
aVAnd you need some design
p58
aVto be successful.
p59
aVSo, cooking is a very important technology,
p60
aVbecause it allowed us to acquire
p61
aVwhat brought you all here:
p62
aVthe big brain,
p63
aVthis wonderful cerebral cortex we have.
p64
aVBecause brains are expensive.
p65
aVThose have to pay tuition fees know.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVBut it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.
p68
aVYou now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,
p69
aVbut actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.
p70
aVIt's very expensive.
p71
aVWhere does the energy come from. Of course, from food.
p72
aVIf we eat raw food,
p73
aVwe cannot release really the energy.
p74
aVSo this ingenuity of our ancestors,
p75
aVto invent this most marvelous technology.
p76
aVInvisible \u2014 everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.
p77
aVCooking made it possible
p78
aVthat mutations,
p79
aVnatural selections, our environment,
p80
aVcould develop us.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo if we think about
p83
aVthis unleashing human potential,
p84
aVwhich was possible by cooking and food,
p85
aVwhy do we talk so badly about food?
p86
aVWhy is it always do and don'ts
p87
aVand it's good for you, it's not good for you?
p88
aVI think the good news for me
p89
aVwould be if we could go back
p90
aVand talk about the unleashing,
p91
aVthe continuation of the unleashing of human potential.
p92
aVNow, cooking allowed also
p93
aVthat we became a migrant species.
p94
aVWe walked out of Africa two times.
p95
aVWe populated all the ecologies.
p96
aVIf you can cook, nothing can happen to you,
p97
aVbecause whatever you find,
p98
aVyou will try to transform it.
p99
aVIt keeps also your brain working.
p100
aVNow the very easy and simple technology
p101
aVwhich was developed
p102
aVactually runs after this formula.
p103
aVTake something which looks like food, transform it,
p104
aVand it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis technology affected two organs,
p107
aVthe brain and the gut, which it actually affected.
p108
aVThe brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.
p109
aVOkay, it's not obvious to be honest.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVBut it shrunk to 60 percent
p112
aVof primate gut
p113
aVof my body mass.
p114
aVSo because of having cooked food,
p115
aVit's easier to digest.
p116
aVNow having a large brain, as you know,
p117
aVis a big advantage,
p118
aVbecause you can actually influence your environment.
p119
aVYou can influence your own technologies you have invented.
p120
aVYou can continue to innovate and invent.
p121
aVNow the big brain did this also with cooking.
p122
aVBut how did it actually run this show?
p123
aVHow did it actually interfere?
p124
aVWhat kind of criteria did it use?
p125
aVAnd this is actually taste reward and energy.
p126
aVYou know we have up to five tastes,
p127
aVthree of them sustain us.
p128
aVSweet \u2014 energy.
p129
aVUmami \u2014 this is a meaty taste.
p130
aVYou need proteins for muscles, recovery.
p131
aVSalty,
p132
aVbecause you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.
p133
aVAnd two tastes which protect you \u2014
p134
aVbitter and sour,
p135
aVwhich are against
p136
aVpoisonous and rotten material.
p137
aVBut of course, they are hard-wired
p138
aVbut we use them still in a sophisticated way.
p139
aVThink about bittersweet chocolate;
p140
aVor think about the acidity
p141
aVof yogurt \u2014 wonderful \u2014
p142
aVmixed with strawberry fruits.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing
p145
aVbecause we know
p146
aVthat, in cooking, we can transform it
p147
aVto the form.
p148
aVReward: this is a more complex
p149
aVand especially integrative
p150
aVform of our brain
p151
aVwith various different elements \u2014
p152
aVthe external states, our internal states,
p153
aVhow do we feel, and so on are put together.
p154
aVAnd something which maybe you don't like
p155
aVbut you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.
p156
aVSo satisfaction was a very important part.
p157
aVAnd as I say, energy was necessary.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow how did the gut actually
p160
aVparticipate in this development?
p161
aVAnd the gut is a silent voice \u2014
p162
aVit's going more for feelings.
p163
aVI use the euphemism digestive comfort \u2014
p164
aVactually \u2014 it's a digestive discomfort,
p165
aVwhich the gut is concerned with.
p166
aVIf you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,
p167
aVwas not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation
p168
aVor maybe other things went wrong.
p169
aVSo my story is a tale of two brains,
p170
aVbecause it might surprise you,
p171
aVour gut has a full-fledged brain.
p172
aVAll the managers in the room say,
p173
aV"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.
p174
aVThis is what we are using."
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVAnd actually you use it and it's actually useful.
p177
aVBecause our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,
p178
aVthey do speak with each other
p179
aVand make decisions.
p180
aVBut what it means
p181
aVto have a brain there
p182
aVis that, not only the big brain
p183
aVhas to talk with the food,
p184
aVthe food has to talk with the brain,
p185
aVbecause we have to learn actually
p186
aVhow to talk to the brains.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow if there's a gut brain,
p189
aVwe should also learn to talk with this brain.
p190
aVNow 150 years ago,
p191
aVanatomists described very, very carefully \u2014
p192
aVhere is a model of a wall of a gut.
p193
aVI took the three elements \u2014
p194
aVstomach, small intestine and colon.
p195
aVAnd within this structure,
p196
aVyou see these two pinkish layers,
p197
aVwhich are actually the muscle.
p198
aVAnd between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,
p199
aVa lot of nervous tissues,
p200
aVwhich penetrate actually the muscle \u2014
p201
aVpenetrate the submucosa,
p202
aVwhere you have all the elements for the immune system.
p203
aVThe gut is actually the largest immune system,
p204
aVdefending your body.
p205
aVIt penetrates the mucosa.
p206
aVThis is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing
p207
aVand you digest,
p208
aVwhich is actually the lumen.
p209
aVNow if you think about the gut,
p210
aVthe gut is \u2014 if you could stretch it \u2014
p211
aV40 meters long,
p212
aVthe length of a tennis court.
p213
aVIf we could unroll it,
p214
aVget out all the folds and so on,
p215
aVit would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd now this brain takes care over this,
p218
aVto move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface
p219
aVand, of course, digest our food we cook.
p220
aVSo if we give you a specification,
p221
aVthis brain, which is autonomous,
p222
aVhave 500 million nerve cells,
p223
aV100 million neurons \u2014
p224
aVso around the size of a cat brain,
p225
aVso there sleeps a little cat \u2014
p226
aVthinks for itself,
p227
aVoptimizes whatever it digests.
p228
aVIt has 20 different neuron types.
p229
aVIt's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,
p230
aVwhere you have 100 billion neurons.
p231
aVIt has autonomous organized microcircuits,
p232
aVhas these programs which run.
p233
aVIt senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
p234
aVIt senses it by chemical means
p235
aVand very importantly by mechanical means,
p236
aVbecause it has to move the food \u2014
p237
aVit has to mix all the various elements
p238
aVwhich we need for digestion.
p239
aVThis control of muscle is very, very important,
p240
aVbecause, you know, there can be reflexes.
p241
aVIf you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.
p242
aVIt's this brain which makes this reflex.
p243
aVAnd then finally,
p244
aVit controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,
p245
aVwhich actually digests the food we cook.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow how do the two brains work with each other?
p248
aVI took here a model from robotics \u2014
p249
aVit's called the Subsumption Architecture.
p250
aVWhat it means is that we have a layered control system.
p251
aVThe lower layer, our gut brain,
p252
aVhas its own goals \u2014 digestion defense \u2014
p253
aVand we have the higher brain
p254
aVwith the goal of integration
p255
aVand generating behaviors.
p256
aVNow both look \u2014 and this is the blue arrows \u2014
p257
aVboth look to the same food, which is in the lumen
p258
aVand in the area of your intestine.
p259
aVThe big brain integrates signals,
p260
aVwhich come from the running programs
p261
aVof the lower brain,
p262
aVBut subsumption means
p263
aVthat the higher brain can interfere with the lower.
p264
aVIt can replace,
p265
aVor it can inhibit actually, signals.
p266
aVSo if we take two types of signals \u2014
p267
aVa hunger signal for example.
p268
aVIf you have an empty stomach,
p269
aVyour stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.
p270
aVIt's a very big signal;
p271
aVit's sent to the brain says,
p272
aV"Go and eat."
p273
aVYou have stop signals \u2014
p274
aVwe have up to eight stop signals.
p275
aVAt least in my case,
p276
aVthey are not listened to.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo what happens
p280
aVif the big brain in the integration
p281
aVoverrides the signal?
p282
aVSo if you override the hunger signal,
p283
aVyou can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
p284
aVDespite generating
p285
aVa healthy hunger signal,
p286
aVthe big brain ignores it
p287
aVand activates different programs in the gut.
p288
aVThe more usual case
p289
aVis overeating.
p290
aVIt actually takes the signal
p291
aVand changes it,
p292
aVand we continue,
p293
aVeven [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.
p294
aVWe have transferred enough energy."
p295
aVNow the interesting thing is that,
p296
aValong this lower layer \u2014 this gut \u2014
p297
aVthe signal becomes stronger and stronger
p298
aVif undigested, but digestible, material
p299
aVcould penetrate.
p300
aVThis we found from bariatric surgery.
p301
aVThat then the signal would be very, very high.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo now back to the cooking question
p304
aVand back to the design.
p305
aVWe have learned to talk to the big brain \u2014
p306
aVtaste and reward, as you know.
p307
aVNow what would be the language
p308
aVwe have to talk to the gut brain
p309
aVthat its signals are so strong
p310
aVthat the big brain cannot ignore it?
p311
aVThen we would generate something
p312
aVall of us would like to have \u2014
p313
aVa balance between the hunger
p314
aVand the satiation.
p315
aVNow I give you, from our research, a very short claim.
p316
aVThis is fat digestion.
p317
aVYou have on your left
p318
aVan olive oil droplet,
p319
aVand this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.
p320
aVThis is an in vitro experiment.
p321
aVIt's very difficult to work in the intestine.
p322
aVNow everyone would expect
p323
aVthat when the degradation of the oil happens,
p324
aVwhen the constituents are liberated,
p325
aVthey disappear, they go away
p326
aVbecause they [were] absorbed.
p327
aVActually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.
p328
aVAnd I hope you can see
p329
aVthat there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,
p330
aVwhich is water.
p331
aVThis whole system generates a huge surface
p332
aVto allow more enzymes
p333
aVto attack the remaining oil.
p334
aVAnd finally, on your right side,
p335
aVyou see a bubbly,
p336
aVcell-like structure appearing,
p337
aVfrom which the body will absorb the fat.
p338
aVNow if we could take this language \u2014
p339
aVand this is a language of structures \u2014
p340
aVand make it longer-lasting,
p341
aVthat it can go through
p342
aVthe passage of the intestine,
p343
aVit would generate stronger signals.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo our research \u2014
p346
aVand I think the research also at the universities \u2014
p347
aVare now fixing on these points
p348
aVto say: how can we actually \u2014
p349
aVand this might sound trivial now to you \u2014
p350
aVhow can we change cooking?
p351
aVHow can we cook
p352
aVthat we have this language developed?
p353
aVSo what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.
p354
aVWe have a coctivor's opportunity,
p355
aVbecause we have learned over the last two million years
p356
aVwhich taste and reward \u2014
p357
aVquite sophisticated to cook \u2014
p358
aVto please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.
p359
aVIf we add the matrix,
p360
aVif we add the structure language, which we have to learn,
p361
aVwhen we learn it, then we can put it back;
p362
aVand around energy,
p363
aVwe could generate a balance,
p364
aVwhich comes out
p365
aVfrom our really primordial operation: cooking.
p366
aVSo, to make cooking really
p367
aVa very important element,
p368
aVI would say even philosophers have to change
p369
aVand have to finally recognize
p370
aVthat cooking is what made us.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo I would say, coquo ergo sum:
p373
aVI cook, therefore I am.
p374
aVThank you very much.
