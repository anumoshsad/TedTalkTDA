VI wanted to be a rock star.
p4
aVI dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.
p5
aVTo be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.
p6
aVThis was in the late '80s.
p7
aVAnd mostly I wanted to be the fifth member
p8
aVof Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.
p9
aVThey wouldn't have me.
p10
aVI didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.
p11
aVAnd I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.
p12
aVAnd I was certain that's what my life would be.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas
p15
aVwhen I was 18,
p16
aVI was stunned to find
p17
aVthat there was not a Pop Star 101,
p18
aVor even a degree program for that interest.
p19
aVAnd the choir conductor there
p20
aVknew that I sang
p21
aVand invited me to come and join the choir.
p22
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."
p23
aVAnd I left the room and said, "No way."
p24
aVThe choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,
p25
aVand there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.
p26
aVAnd about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,
p27
aV"Listen, you've got to join choir.
p28
aVAt the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,
p29
aVall expenses paid.
p30
aVAnd the soprano section is just full of hot girls."
p31
aVAnd so I figured for Mexico and babes,
p32
aVI could do just about anything.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd I went to my first day in choir,
p35
aVand I sat down with the basses
p36
aVand sort of looked over my shoulder
p37
aVto see what they were doing.
p38
aVThey opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,
p39
aVand boom, they launched into the Kyrie
p40
aVfrom the "Requiem" by Mozart.
p41
aVIn my entire life I had seen in black and white,
p42
aVand suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.
p43
aVThe most transformative experience I've ever had \u2014
p44
aVin that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony
p45
aVand people singing, people together,
p46
aVthe shared vision.
p47
aVAnd I felt for the first time in my life
p48
aVthat I was part of something bigger than myself.
p49
aVAnd there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.
p50
aa(lp51
VI decided to write a piece for choir
p52
aVa couple of years later
p53
aVas a gift to this conductor
p54
aVwho had changed my life.
p55
aVI had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.
p56
aVAnd that piece was published,
p57
aVand then I wrote another piece, and that got published.
p58
aVAnd then I started conducting,
p59
aVand I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.
p60
aVAnd I find myself now in the unlikely position
p61
aVof standing in front of all of you
p62
aVas a professional classical composer and conductor.
p63
aa(lp64
VWell a couple of years ago,
p65
aVa friend of mine emailed me
p66
aVa link, a YouTube link,
p67
aVand said, "You have got to see this."
p68
aVAnd it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,
p69
aVsinging the soprano line
p70
aVto a piece of mine called "Sleep."
p71
aa(lp72
V(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.
p73
aVMy name is Britlin Losee,
p74
aVand this is a video
p75
aVthat I'd like to make for you.
p76
aVHere's me singing "Sleep."
p77
aVI'm a little nervous, just to let you know.
p78
aV\u266b If there are noises \u266b
p79
aV\u266b in the night \u266b
p80
aa(lp81
VEric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.
p82
aVBritlin was so innocent and so sweet,
p83
aVand her voice was so pure.
p84
aVAnd I even loved seeing behind her;
p85
aVI could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.
p86
aVSuch an intimate video.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd I had this idea: if I could get 50 people
p89
aVto all do this same thing,
p90
aVsing their parts \u2014 soprano, alto, tenor and bass \u2014
p91
aVwherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,
p92
aVwe could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.
p93
aVSo I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."
p94
aVI actually wrote, "OMG,"
p95
aVhopefully for the last time in public ever.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAnd I sent out this call to singers.
p98
aVAnd I made free the download of the music
p99
aVto a piece that I had written in the year 2000
p100
aVcalled "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."
p101
aVAnd lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow I should say, before that,
p104
aVwhat I did is I posted a conductor track
p105
aVof myself conducting.
p106
aVAnd it's in complete silence when I filmed it,
p107
aVbecause I was only hearing the music in my head,
p108
aVimagining the choir that would one day come to be.
p109
aVAfterwards, I played a piano track underneath
p110
aVso that the singers would have something to listen to.
p111
aVAnd then as the videos started to come in ...
p112
aa(lp113
V(Singing)
p114
aVThis is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Singing)
p117
aVThis is Evangelina Etienne
p118
aa(lp119
V(Singing)
p120
aVfrom Massachusetts.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Singing)
p123
aVStephen Hanson from Sweden.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Singing)
p126
aVThis is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Singing)
p129
aa(lp130
VThere was even a little soprano solo in the piece,
p131
aVand so I had auditions.
p132
aVAnd a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.
p133
aVI was told later,
p134
aVand also by lots of singers who were involved in this,
p135
aVthat they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes
p136
aVuntil they got just the right take \u2014 they uploaded it.
p137
aVHere's our winner of the soprano solo.
p138
aVThis is Melody Myers from Tennessee.
p139
aV(Singing)
p140
aVI love the little smile she does right over the top of the note \u2014
p141
aVlike, "No problem, everything's fine."
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd from the crowd
p146
aVemerged this young man, Scott Haines.
p147
aVAnd he said, "Listen, this is the project
p148
aVI've been looking for my whole life.
p149
aVI'd like to be the person to edit this all together."
p150
aVI said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."
p151
aVAnd Scott aggregated all of the videos.
p152
aVHe scrubbed the audio.
p153
aVHe made sure that everything lined up.
p154
aVAnd then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.
p155
aVThis is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Singing)
p158
aa(lp159
VI'll stop it there in the interest of time.
p160
aV(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you. Thank you.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VThank you.
p167
aVSo there's more. There's more.
p168
aVThank you so much.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I had the same reaction you did.
p171
aVI actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.
p172
aVI just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it \u2014
p173
aVthese souls all on their own desert island,
p174
aVsending electronic messages in bottles to each other.
p175
aVAnd the video went viral.
p176
aVWe had a million hits in the first month
p177
aVand got a lot of attention for it.
p178
aVAnd because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,
p179
aV"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"
p180
aVAnd so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0
p181
aVthat I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,
p182
aV"Sleep," which is another work
p183
aVthat I wrote in the year 2000 \u2014
p184
aVpoetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.
p185
aVAnd again, I posted a conductor video,
p186
aVand we started accepting submissions.
p187
aVThis time we got some more mature members.
p188
aV(Singing)
p189
aVAnd some younger members.

p193
aVEW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.
p194
aVIsn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?
p195
aa(lp196
VSomeone did all eight videos \u2014
p197
aVa bass even singing the soprano parts.
p198
aVThis is Beau Awtin.
p199
aV(Video) Beau Awtin: \u266b Safe in bed \u266b
p200
aa(lp201
VEW: And our goal \u2014 it was sort of an arbitrary goal \u2014
p202
aVthere was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop"
p203
aVand they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.
p204
aVAnd there were 900 people involved in that.
p205
aVSo I told the singers, "That's our goal.
p206
aVThat's the number for us to beat."
p207
aVAnd we just closed submissions January 10th,
p208
aVand our final tally was 2,051 videos
p209
aVfrom 58 different countries.
p210
aVThank you.
p211
aV(Applause)
p212
aVFrom Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,
p213
aVJordan, Egypt, Israel,
p214
aVas far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd we also put a page on Facebook
p217
aVfor the singers to upload their testimonials,
p218
aVwhat it was like for them, their experience singing it.
p219
aVAnd I've just chosen a few of them here.
p220
aV"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.
p221
aVNow she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.
p222
aVIt's so wonderful to sing together again!"
p223
aVI love the idea that she's singing with her sister.
p224
aV"Aside from the beautiful music,
p225
aVit's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,
p226
aVbut who are connected anyway."
p227
aVAnd my personal favorite,
p228
aV"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,
p229
aVhe told me that I did not have the voice for it."
p230
aVYeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.
p231
aVMe too.
p232
aV"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,
p233
aVbut something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.
p234
aVIt is a dream come true to be part of this choir,
p235
aVas I've never been part of one.
p236
aVWhen I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,
p237
aVI had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.
p238
aVAs I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,
p239
aVsatellite is my connection to the world."
p240
aa(lp241
VSo two things struck me deeply about this.
p242
aVThe first is that human beings
p243
aVwill go to any lengths necessary
p244
aVto find and connect with each other.
p245
aVIt doesn't matter the technology.
p246
aVAnd the second is
p247
aVthat people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.
p248
aVIt wasn't a virtual choir.
p249
aVThere are people now online that are friends; they've never met.
p250
aVBut, I know myself too, I feel
p251
aVthis virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.
p252
aVI feel a closeness to this choir \u2014
p253
aValmost like a family.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat I'd like to close with then today
p256
aVis the first look
p257
aVat "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.
p258
aVThis will be a premiere today.
p259
aVWe're not finished with the video yet.
p260
aVYou can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,
p261
aVthe render time is just atrocious.
p262
aVBut we do have the first three minutes.
p263
aVAnd it's a tremendous honor
p264
aVfor me to be able to show it to you here first.
p265
aVYou're the very first people to see this.
p266
aVThis is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.
