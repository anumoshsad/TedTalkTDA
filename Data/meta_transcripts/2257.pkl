VWhen I was growing up, I really  liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.
p4
aVOne time, though, I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,
p5
aVbut I fell and broke my arm.
p6
aVI actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso.
p7
aVIt was taken off six weeks later, but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,
p8
aVand I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it,
p9
aV100 times per day, seven days per week.
p10
aVI barely did it, because I found it boring and painful,
p11
aVand as a result, it took me another six weeks to get better.
p12
aa(lp13
VMany years later, my mom developed frozen shoulder,
p14
aVwhich leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder.
p15
aVThe person I believed for half of my life to have superpowers
p16
aVsuddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food.
p17
aVShe went each week to physical therapy, but just like me,
p18
aVshe barely followed the home treatment,
p19
aVand it took her over five months to feel better.
p20
aa(lp21
VBoth my mom and I required physical therapy,
p22
aVa process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises
p23
aVin order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury.
p24
aVAt first, a physical therapist works with patients,
p25
aVbut then it's up to the patients to do their exercises at home.
p26
aVBut patients find physical therapy boring, frustrating, confusing
p27
aVand lengthy before seeing results.
p28
aVSadly, patient noncompliance can be as high as 70 percent.
p29
aVThis means the majority of patients don't do their exercises
p30
aVand therefore take a lot longer to get better.
p31
aVAll physical therapists agree that special exercises
p32
aVreduce the time needed for recovery,
p33
aVbut patients lack the motivation to do them.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo together with three friends, all of us software geeks,
p36
aVwe asked ourselves,
p37
aVwouldn't it be interesting if patients could play their way to recovery?
p38
aVWe started building MIRA, A P.C. software platform
p39
aVthat uses this Kinect device, a motion capture camera,
p40
aVto transform traditional exercises into video games.
p41
aa(lp42
VMy physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy.
p43
aVLet's see how this looks.
p44
aVThe first game asks me to fly a bee up and down
p45
aVto gather pollen to deposit in beehives,
p46
aVall while avoiding the other bugs.
p47
aVI control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion,
p48
aVjust like when I was seven years old after the cast was taken off.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen designing a game, we speak to physical therapists at first
p51
aVto understand what movement patients need to do.
p52
aVWe then make that a video game
p53
aVto give patients simple, motivating objectives to follow.
p54
aVBut the software is very customizable,
p55
aVand physical therapists can also create their own exercises.
p56
aVUsing the software, my physical therapist
p57
aVrecorded herself performing a shoulder abduction,
p58
aVwhich is one of the movements my mom had to do
p59
aVwhen she had frozen shoulder.
p60
aVI can follow my therapist's example on the left side of the screen,
p61
aVwhile on the right, I see myself doing the recommended movement.
p62
aVI feel more engaged and confident,
p63
aVas I'm exercising alongside my therapist
p64
aVwith the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me.
p65
aVThis basically extends the application for physical therapists
p66
aVto create whatever exercises they think are best.
p67
aa(lp68
VThis is an auction house game for preventing falls,
p69
aVdesigned to strengthen muscles and improve balance.
p70
aVAs a patient, I need to do sit and stand movements,
p71
aVand when I stand up,
p72
aVI bid for the items I want to buy.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VIn two days, my grandmother will be 82 years old,
p76
aVand there's a 50 percent chance for people over 80
p77
aVto fall at least once per year,
p78
aVwhich could lead to a broken hip or even worse.
p79
aVPoor muscle tone and impaired balance are the number one cause of falls,
p80
aVso reversing these problems through targeted exercise
p81
aVwill help keep older people like my grandmother
p82
aVsafer and independent for longer.
p83
aVWhen my schedule ends, MIRA briefly shows me
p84
aVhow I progressed throughout my session.
p85
aa(lp86
VI have just shown you three different games
p87
aVfor kids, adults and seniors.
p88
aVThese can be used with orthopedic or neurologic patients,
p89
aVbut we'll soon have options for children with autism,
p90
aVmental health or speech therapy.
p91
aVMy physical therapist can go back to my profile
p92
aVand see the data gathered during my sessions.
p93
aVShe can see how much I moved, how many points I scored,
p94
aVwith what speed I moved my joints,
p95
aVand so on.
p96
aVMy physical therapist can use all of this to adapt my treatment.
p97
aa(lp98
VI'm so pleased this version is now in use
p99
aVin over 10 clinics across Europe and the U.S.,
p100
aVand we're working on the home version.
p101
aVWe want to enable physical therapists to prescribe this digital treatment
p102
aVand help patients play their way to recovery at home.
p103
aVIf my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy,
p104
aVthen we would have been more successful following the treatment,
p105
aVand perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.
p106

VTom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this
p112
aVthat they're rapidly putting away?
p113
aVWhat is that made of, and how much does it cost?
p114
aa(lp115
VCosmin Milhau: So it's a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,
p116
aVbut you just need a computer and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.
p117
aa(lp118
VTR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing that people use for their Xboxes
p119
aVto do 3D games, right?
p120
aa(lp121
VCM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox, you only need a camera.
p122
aa(lp123
VTR: Right, so this is less than a $1,000 solution.
p124
aa(lp125
VCM: Definitely, 400 dollars, you can definitely use it.
p126
aa(lp127
VTR: So right now, you're doing clinical trials in clinics.
p128
aa(lp129
VCM: Yes.
p130
aa(lp131
VTR: And then the hope is to get it so it's a home version
p132
aVand I can do my exercise remotely,
p133
aVand the therapist at the clinic can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.
p134
aa(lp135
VCM: Exactly.
p136
aa(lp137
VTR: Cool. Thanks so much. CM: Thank you.
