VWe all make decisions every day; we want to know
p4
aVwhat the right thing is to do \u2014 in domains from the financial
p5
aVto the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
p6
aVAnd surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do
p7
aVexactly the right thing at all possible times,
p8
aVthat would be a tremendous gift.
p9
aa(lp10
VIt turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738
p11
aVby a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
p12
aVAnd what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,
p13
aVand I also want to explain to you why it is
p14
aVthat it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.
p17
aVAnd if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
p18
aVBut the simple English translation \u2014 much less precise,
p19
aVbut it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say \u2014 was this:
p20
aVThe expected value of any of our actions \u2014
p21
aVthat is, the goodness that we can count on getting \u2014
p22
aVis the product of two simple things:
p23
aVthe odds that this action will allow us to gain something,
p24
aVand the value of that gain to us.
p25
aa(lp26
VIn a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,
p27
aVif we can estimate and multiply these two things,
p28
aVwe will always know precisely how we should behave.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, this simple equation, even for those of you
p31
aVwho don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
p32
aVHere's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play
p33
aVa little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,
p34
aVand if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,
p35
aVbut you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,
p36
aVmost of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know
p37
aVthat the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
p38
aVthat multiplies to five, and that's more
p39
aVthan I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
p40
aVThis is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,
p43
aVbut in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
p44
aVPeople are horrible at estimating both of these things,
p45
aVand that's what I want to talk to you about today.
p46
aa(lp47
VThere are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide
p48
aVwhat the right thing is to do, and those are
p49
aVerrors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,
p50
aVand errors in estimating the value of their own success.
p51
aVNow, let me talk about the first one first.
p52
aVCalculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:
p53
aVthere are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
p54
aVYou all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
p55
aVor of flipping a heads.
p56
aVBut as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply
p57
aVin everyday life. That's why Americans spend more \u2014
p58
aVI should say, lose more \u2014 gambling
p59
aVthan on all other forms of entertainment combined.
p60
aVThe reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe way people figure odds
p63
aVrequires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
p64
aVNow, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think
p65
aVthere are more dogs or pigs on leashes
p66
aVobserved in any particular day in Oxford.
p67
aVAnd of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
p68
aVAnd the way that you know that the answer is dogs is
p69
aVyou quickly reviewed in memory the times
p70
aVyou've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
p71
aVIt was very easy to remember seeing dogs,
p72
aVnot so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed
p73
aVthat if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,
p74
aVthen dogs on leashes are more probable.
p75
aVThat's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, for example, here's a word puzzle.
p78
aVAre there more four-letter English words
p79
aVwith R in the third place or R in the first place?
p80
aVWell, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,
p81
aVand it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,
p82
aVand very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
p83
aVBut in fact, there are many more words in the English language
p84
aVwith R in the third than the first place.
p85
aVThe reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind
p86
aVisn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
p87
aVIt's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
p88
aVYou kind of shout out the sound, S \u2014 and the word comes.
p89
aVIt's like the dictionary;
p90
aVit's hard to look things up by the third letter.
p91
aVSo, this is an example of how this idea that
p92
aVthe quickness with which things come to mind
p93
aVcan give you a sense of their probability \u2014
p94
aa(lp95
Vhow this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.
p96
aVFor example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds
p97
aVthat they will die in a variety of interesting ways \u2014
p98
aVthese are estimates of number of deaths per year
p99
aVper 200 million U.S. citizens.
p100
aVAnd these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked
p101
aVto guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
p102
aVCompare these to the actual numbers.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,
p105
aVtwo things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
p106
aVTwo things are vastly underestimated:
p107
aVdying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
p108
aVWhen was the last time that you picked up a newspaper
p109
aVand the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
p110
aVIt's not interesting because it's so common.
p111
aVIt's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances
p112
aVof news stories or newsreels where we've seen
p113
aVtornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck
p114
aVwho's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
p115
aVDrownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
p116
aVThey don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,
p117
aVwe vastly underestimate them.
p118
aa(lp119
VIndeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game
p120
aVof "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say
p121
aVit's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool
p122
aVis the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
p123
aVThe way that more of you are likely to die than the combination
p124
aVof all three of the others that you see on the slide.
p125
aa(lp126
VThe lottery is an excellent example, of course \u2014 an excellent test-case
p127
aVof people's ability to compute probabilities.
p128
aVAnd economists \u2014 forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery \u2014
p129
aVbut economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery
p130
aVas a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff
p131
aVby investing your money in a lottery ticket
p132
aVare approximately equivalent to flushing the money
p133
aVdirectly down the toilet \u2014 which, by the way,
p134
aVdoesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?
p137
aVWell, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,
p138
aVwe see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,
p139
aVor Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check \u2014
p140
aVhow the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
p141
aVWe see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
p142
aVWhen was the last time that you saw extensive interviews
p143
aVwith everybody who lost?
p144
aVIndeed, if we required that television stations run
p145
aVa 30-second interview with each loser
p146
aVevery time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers
p147
aVin the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years
p148
aVof your undivided attention just to watch them say,
p149
aV"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
p150
aVNow, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television \u2014
p151
aVno sleep, no potty breaks \u2014 and you saw loss after loss after loss,
p152
aVand then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"
p153
aVthe likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
p154
aa(lp155
VLook, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.
p156
aVThere's 10 tickets in this lottery.
p157
aVNine of them have been sold to these individuals.
p158
aVIt costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,
p159
aVyou get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
p160
aVWell, Bernoulli tells us it is.
p161
aVThe expected value of this lottery is two dollars;
p162
aVthis is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
p163
aVAnd most people say, "OK, I'll play."
p164
aa(lp165
VNow, a slightly different version of this lottery:
p166
aVimagine that the nine tickets are all owned
p167
aVby one fat guy named Leroy.
p168
aVLeroy has nine tickets; there's one left.
p169
aVDo you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
p170
aVNow, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,
p171
aVbut it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
p172
aVIt's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
p173
aVYou can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"
p174
aVbecause you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
p175
aVThe fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy
p176
aVchanges your decision to play,
p177
aVeven though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake
p180
aVcompared to trying to estimate value:
p181
aVtrying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,
p182
aVhow much pleasure it will give us.
p183
aVI want to talk now about errors in value.
p184
aVHow much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
p185
aVMost of you have the intuition that it's not \u2014
p186
aVyou wouldn't pay that for it.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires
p189
aVthat you ask one, and only one question, which is:
p190
aVWhat else can I do with 25 dollars?
p191
aVIf you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia
p192
aVand realized that they're not going to serve you any food,
p193
aVbut somebody in the row in front of you has just opened
p194
aVthe McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches
p195
aVis wafting over the seat, you think,
p196
aVI can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
p197
aVI can't even set it on fire \u2014 they took my cigarette lighter!
p198
aVSuddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
p199
aa(lp200
VOn the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,
p201
aVand 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
p202
aVWhy were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,
p203
aVbefore I'd even told you anything about the context?
p204
aVBecause most of you compared the price of this Big Mac
p205
aVto the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,
p206
aV"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment
p207
aVto other possible investments, you compared to the past.
p208
aVAnd this is a systematic error people make.
p209
aVWhat you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing
p212
aVthe kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
p213
aVFor example, this is, of course,
p214
aVone of the most delicious tricks in marketing,
p215
aVis to say something used to be higher,
p216
aVand suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
p217
aVWhen people are asked about these two different jobs:
p218
aVa job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,
p219
aVa job where you're getting a salary cut each year,
p220
aVand one in which you're getting a salary increase,
p221
aVpeople like the second job better than the first, despite the fact
p222
aVthey're all told they make much less money. Why?
p223
aVBecause they had the sense that declining wages are worse
p224
aVthan rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher
p225
aVin the declining period. Here's another nice example.
p226
aa(lp227
VHere's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.
p228
aVAssuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
p229
aVMost people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:
p230
aV$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,
p231
aVso you decide to mull it over for a week.
p232
aVBy the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone \u2014
p233
aVthe package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
p234
aVWhy? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500
p235
aVfor something that was 700 last week.
p236
aa(lp237
VThis tendency to compare to the past
p238
aVis causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,
p239
aVa good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good
p240
aVas an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
p241
aa(lp242
VHere's another example of how comparing to the past
p243
aVcan befuddle our decisions.
p244
aVImagine that you're going to the theater.
p245
aVYou're on your way to the theater.
p246
aVIn your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.
p247
aVYou also have a 20-dollar bill.
p248
aVWhen you arrive at the theater,
p249
aVyou discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
p250
aVWould you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
p251
aVMost people answer, no.
p252
aVNow, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
p253
aVYou're on your way to the theater,
p254
aVand in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
p255
aVWhen you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
p256
aVWould you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
p257
aVWell, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.
p258
aVWhat does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, just in case you're not getting it,
p261
aVhere's a schematic of what happened, OK?
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVAlong the way, you lost something.
p264
aVIn both cases, it was a piece of paper.
p265
aVIn one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
p266
aVWhat the hell difference should it make?
p267
aVThe difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,
p268
aVI'm not paying twice for the same thing.
p269
aVYou compare the cost of the play now \u2014 40 dollars \u2014
p270
aVto the cost that it used to have \u2014 20 dollars \u2014 and you say it's a bad deal.
p271
aVComparing with the past causes many of the problems
p272
aVthat behavioral economists and psychologists identify
p273
aVin people's attempts to assign value.
p274
aVBut even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,
p275
aVwe still make certain kinds of mistakes.
p276
aVAnd I'm going to show you one or two of them.
p277
aa(lp278
VOne of the things we know about comparison:
p279
aVthat when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
p280
aVSo in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were
p281
aVkind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,
p282
aVdidn't seem like such a great guy.
p283
aVSuddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
p284
aV(Laughter)
p285
aVThe comparison changes how we evaluate him.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,
p288
aVand they use this wisdom to help you \u2014
p289
aVspare you the undue burden of money.
p290
aVAnd so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop
p291
aVand you had to buy a bottle of wine,
p292
aVand you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
p293
aVMost people don't want the most expensive,
p294
aVthey don't want the least expensive.
p295
aVSo, they will opt for the item in the middle.
p296
aVIf you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item
p297
aVthat nobody will ever buy on the shelf,
p298
aVbecause suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo I'm telling you something you already knew:
p301
aVnamely, that comparison changes the value of things.
p302
aVHere's why that's a problem:
p303
aVthe problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,
p304
aVit won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
p305
aVThe comparisons we make when we are appraising value,
p306
aVwhere we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,
p307
aVare not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
p308
aVThis problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil
p309
aVour attempts to make rational decisions.
p310
aa(lp311
VLet me just give you an example.
p312
aVI have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
p313
aVThese are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked
p314
aVthe simplest of all questions:
p315
aVHow much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
p316
aVThey're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
p317
aVFor some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room
p318
aVis a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
p319
aVIn fact, these items that are sitting in the room change
p320
aVhow much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
p321
aVNamely, those who are looking at Spam
p322
aVthink potato chips are going to be quite tasty;
p323
aVthose who are looking at Godiva chocolate
p324
aVthink they won't be nearly so tasty.
p325
aVOf course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
p326
aVWell, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that
p327
aVwhen you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,
p328
aVwhat's sitting in the corner of the room
p329
aVmakes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
p330
aVNonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison
p331
aVthat then does not carry through and change their experience.
p332
aa(lp333
VYou've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come
p334
aVinto our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:
p335
aVYou want to buy a car stereo.
p336
aVThe dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,
p337
aVbut if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
p338
aVSo would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
p339
aVMost people say they would.
p340
aVThey can't imagine buying it for twice the price
p341
aVwhen, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
p342
aa(lp343
VNow, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,
p344
aVand the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
p345
aVBut if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
p346
aVWould you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings \u2014 the 100 dollars.
p347
aVMost people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town
p348
aVto save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
p349
aa(lp350
VThis kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.
p351
aVBecause this 100 dollars that you save \u2014 hello! \u2014
p352
aVdoesn't know where it came from.
p353
aVIt doesn't know what you saved it on.
p354
aVWhen you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,
p355
aVI'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,
p356
aVI'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
p357
aVAnd if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks
p358
aVno matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
p359
aVThat's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager
p360
aVis taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,
p361
aVbut they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
p362
aa(lp363
VNow, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,
p364
aVbecause what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks
p365
aVto the purchase that you're making,
p366
aVbut when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
p367
aVYou've all had this experience.
p368
aa(lp369
VIf you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.
p370
aVAnd at some point you may have met a couple
p371
aVfrom your own hometown, and you thought,
p372
aV"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
p373
aVI mean, compared to all these people who hate me
p374
aVwhen I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,
p375
aVthese people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,
p376
aVand then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,
p377
aVand what do you find?
p378
aVCompared to your regular friends,
p379
aVthey are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,
p380
aVthe comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself
p381
aVdisliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.
p384
aVYou go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers \u2014
p385
aVthese big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,
p386
aVand you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:
p387
aVthe big ones sound a little better.
p388
aVAnd so you buy them, and you bring them home,
p389
aVand you entirely violate the décor of your house.
p390
aVAnd the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store
p391
aVis a comparison you'll never make again.
p392
aVWhat are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,
p393
aV"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"
p394
aVwhich you can't even remember hearing.
p395
aa(lp396
VThe problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult
p397
aVwhen these choices are arrayed over time.
p398
aVPeople have a lot of trouble making decisions
p399
aVabout things that will happen at different points in time.
p400
aVAnd what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered
p401
aVis that by and large people use two simple rules.
p402
aVSo let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem
p403
aVand then a third, hard, problem.
p404
aa(lp405
VHere's the first easy problem:
p406
aVYou can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
p407
aVThis is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
p408
aVAll of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,
p409
aVwe believe more is better than less.
p410
aa(lp411
VHere's the second problem:
p412
aVYou can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
p413
aVAgain, an easy decision,
p414
aVbecause we all know that now is better than later.
p415
aVWhat's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.
p416
aVFor example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
p417
aVThis typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain
p418
aVby waiting, but you have to be patient.
p419
aVWhat do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
p420
aVWell, by and large people are enormously impatient.
p421
aVThat is, they require interest rates in the hundred
p422
aVor thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
p423
aVand wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
p424
aVMaybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is
p425
aVhow easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing
p426
aVwhen the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
p427
aVImagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year \u2014 that's 12 months \u2014
p428
aVor 60 dollars in 13 months.
p429
aVWhat do we find now?
p430
aVPeople are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,
p431
aVthey might as well wait 13.
p432
aa(lp433
VWhat makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?
p434
aVComparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
p435
aa(lp436
VThis is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested
p437
aVyou would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,
p438
aVpeople find that the subjective value of 50 is higher
p439
aVthan the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now
p440
aVor one month, respectively \u2014 a 30-day delay \u2014
p441
aVbut they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision
p442
aVoff into the future a year.
p443
aVNow, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
p444
aa(lp445
VThese guys can tell us.
p446
aVWhat you see here are two lads,
p447
aVone of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
p448
aVThey are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,
p449
aVand I want you to notice two things.
p450
aVAt no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
p451
aVHowever, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
p452
aVFirst it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,
p453
aVthen a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
p454
aa(lp455
VHere are the results of what I just showed you.
p456
aVThis is the subjective height \u2014
p457
aVthe height you saw of these guys at various points.
p458
aVAnd I want you to see that two things are true.
p459
aVOne, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;
p460
aVand two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
p461
aVBut watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
p462
aVAt a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,
p463
aVbut at a far distance
p464
aVtheir normal, their true, relations are preserved.
p465
aVAs Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
p466
aVThese are the results of the hard problem I gave you:
p467
aV60 now or 50 in a month?
p468
aVAnd these are subjective values,
p469
aVand what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
p470
aa(lp471
VPeople always think more is better than less:
p472
aV60 is always better than 50,
p473
aVand they always think now is better than later:
p474
aVthe bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
p475
aVWatch what happens when we drop some out.
p476
aVSuddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
p477
aVWe have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now
p478
aVover waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
p479
aVNotice something interesting that this implies \u2014 namely, that
p480
aVwhen people get to the future, they will change their minds.
p481
aVThat is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,
p482
aVwhat was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
p483
aVI'll take the 50 dollars now.
p484
aa(lp485
VWell, the question with which I'd like to end is this:
p486
aVIf we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
p487
aVBecause I could go on for about two hours with evidence
p488
aVof people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
p489
aa(lp490
VThe answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard
p491
aVin some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:
p492
aVnamely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world
p493
aVthan the one in which we are living.
p494
aVThey were evolved for a world
p495
aVin which people lived in very small groups,
p496
aVrarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,
p497
aVhad rather short lives in which there were few choices
p498
aVand the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
p499
aa(lp500
VBernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us
p501
aVhow we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
p502
aVThat explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains
p503
aVwhy it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
p504
aVWe are the only species on this planet
p505
aVthat has ever held its own fate in its hands.
p506
aVWe have no significant predators,
p507
aVwe're the masters of our physical environment;
p508
aVthe things that normally cause species to become extinct
p509
aVare no longer any threat to us.
p510
aVThe only thing \u2014 the only thing \u2014 that can destroy us and doom us
p511
aVare our own decisions.
p512
aVIf we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because
p513
aVwe could not take advantage of the gift given to us
p514
aVby a young Dutch fellow in 1738,
p515
aVbecause we underestimated the odds of our future pains
p516
aVand overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
p517
aa(lp518
VThank you.
p519
aV(Applause)
p520
aa(lp521
VChris Anderson: That was remarkable.
p522
aVWe have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
p523
aa(lp524
VBill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism
p525
aVis in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,
p526
aVand is there some way that we could counteract that?
p527
aa(lp528
VDan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently
p529
aVwith the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes
p530
aVthat American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
p531
aVI tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name
p532
aVbased on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,
p533
aVand that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask
p534
aVwhat causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,
p535
aVrather than \u2014 not rather than, but in addition to
p536
aVstopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
p537
aVSurely the kinds of play that at least American media give to \u2014
p538
aVand forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
p539
aVWe already know, for example, in the United States,
p540
aVmore people have died as a result of not taking airplanes \u2014
p541
aVbecause they were scared \u2014 and driving on highways,
p542
aVthan were killed in 9/11. OK?
p543
aVIf I told you that there was a plague
p544
aVthat was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,
p545
aVyou might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
p546
aVThese are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering
p547
aVwhether they should get the kind of play,
p548
aVthe kind of coverage, that they do.
p549
aVSurely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood
p550
aVthat they'll be hurt in these various ways,
p551
aVand gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
p552
aa(lp553
VCA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying
p554
aVthat our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
p555
aVTalk more about it.
p556
aa(lp557
VDG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
p558
aVIf Australia disappears tomorrow,
p559
aVterror is probably the right response.
p560
aVThat's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,
p561
aVwhen a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,
p562
aVmore people than that were killed
p563
aVby not using their seatbelts in the same country.
p564
aVIs terror the right response?
p565
aa(lp566
VCA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event \u2014
p567
aVthat it's so spectacular?
p568
aVIs it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
p569
aVWhat is it?
p570
aa(lp571
VDG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.
p572
aVFirst, it's a human agent trying to kill us \u2014
p573
aVit's not a tree falling on us by accident.
p574
aVSecond, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
p575
aVPeople are being killed for no reason instead of good reason \u2014
p576
aVas if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
p577
aVSo there are a number of things that together
p578
aVmake this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down
p579
aVthe fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it
p580
aVthey want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,
p581
aVwho want these things to be
p582
aVas spectacular as they possibly can.
p583
aa(lp584
VCA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
p585
aa(lp586
VDG: Well, go to Israel. You know,
p587
aVgo to Israel. And a mall blows up,
p588
aVand then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later \u2014
p589
aVat least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall
p590
aVwhen it blew up \u2014 I went back to my hotel
p591
aVand the wedding that was planned was still going on.
p592
aVAnd as the Israeli mother said,
p593
aVshe said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
p594
aVI mean, this is a society that has learned \u2014
p595
aVand there are others too \u2014 that has learned to live
p596
aVwith a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,
p597
aVshall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
p598
aa(lp599
VCA: But is there a rational fear that actually,
p600
aVthe reason we're frightened about this is because we think that
p601
aVthe Big One is to come?
p602
aa(lp603
VDG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack
p604
aVthere would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people \u2014
p605
aVwe would probably not be nearly so frightened.
p606
aVI don't want to say \u2014 please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere
p607
aVas saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
p608
aVThat's not my point at all.
p609
aVWhat I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,
p610
aVour distress about things that happen, about threats,
p611
aVshould be roughly proportional to the size of those threats
p612
aVand threats to come.
p613
aVI think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
p614
aVAnd many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today \u2014
p615
aVhow many people do you know got up and said,
p616
aVPoverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
p617
aVPeople get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
p618
aVIt's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
p619
aVThere are no guns going off.
p620
aVI mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,
p621
aVwhich would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
p622
aV(Laughter)
p623
aV(Applause)
p624
aVThat's a tough one.
p625
aa(lp626
VCA: There's no question.
p627
aVPoverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,
p628
aVunless someone can show that there's, you know,
p629
aVterrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
p630
aVThe latest I've read, seen, thought
p631
aVis that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
p632
aVIf that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,
p633
aVbut with poverty it's a bit \u2014
p634
aa(lp635
VDG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.
p636
aa(lp637
VCA: We've evolved to get all excited
p638
aVabout these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,
p639
aVin the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease
p640
aVand systems that cause poverty and so forth,
p641
aVand so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy
p642
aVinto worrying about those things?
p643
aVPeople died; so be it.
p644
aVBut if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
p645
aVAnd so we evolved these responses.
p646
aVIs that what happened?
p647
aa(lp648
VDG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical
p649
aVabout leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything
p650
aVare the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
p651
aVMy guess is that there's nothing quite that specific
p652
aVin our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for
p653
aVan evolutionary explanation, you might say
p654
aVthat most organisms are neo-phobic \u2014 that is, they're a little scared
p655
aVof stuff that's new and different.
p656
aVAnd there's a good reason to be,
p657
aVbecause old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
p658
aVAny animal you see that you've seen before is less likely
p659
aVto be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
p660
aVSo, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,
p661
aVour general tendency is to orient towards
p662
aVthat which is new and novel is activated.
p663
aVI don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism
p664
aVas the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.
p665
aa(lp666
VJay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about
p667
aVthe stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect
p668
aVyou're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,
p669
aVwhich is the error of value.
p670
aVI know, because I've interviewed
p671
aVabout 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
p672
aVIt turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
p673
aVThat's what you think it is. All right?
p674
aVThe average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,
p675
aVso the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,
p676
aVand yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
p677
aVIt's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
p678
aVIt's because the anticipation of possibly winning
p679
aVreleases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling
p680
aVuntil the drawing indicates you've lost.
p681
aVOr, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,
p682
aVyou can have a much better feeling than flushing the money
p683
aVdown the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
p684
aVNow, economists tend to \u2014
p685
aV(Applause)
p686
aV\u2014 economists tend to view the world
p687
aVthrough their own lenses, which is:
p688
aVthis is just a bunch of stupid people.
p689
aVAnd as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
p690
aVAnd so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,
p691
aVwe didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
p692
aV(Applause)
p693
aa(lp694
VDG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen
p695
aVwhether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled
p696
aVby the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,
p697
aVpeople who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,
p698
aVeven though they don't feel great during the drawing.
p699
aVI would disagree that people know they're not going to win.
p700
aVI think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,
p701
aVwhich is why they prefer that to the flushing.
p702
aVBut certainly I see your point: that there can be
p703
aVsome utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
p704
aVNow, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.
p705
aVThat isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
p706
aa(lp707
VCA: Last question.
p708
aa(lp709
VAubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
p710
aVI work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills \u2014
p711
aVI work on aging \u2014 and I'm interested in doing something about it,
p712
aVas we'll all hear tomorrow.
p713
aVI very much resonate with what you're saying,
p714
aVbecause it seems to me that the problem
p715
aVwith getting people interested in doing anything about aging
p716
aVis that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer
p717
aVor heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
p718
aV(Laughter)
p719
aa(lp720
VDG: For you or for them?
p721
aa(lp722
VAdG: In persuading them.
p723
aa(lp724
VDG: Ah, for you in persuading them.
p725
aVWell, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
p726
aVBut one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work
p727
aVis to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
p728
aVOne of the problems with making decisions about the far future
p729
aVand the near future is that we imagine the near future
p730
aVmuch more vividly than the far future.
p731
aVTo the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail
p732
aVthat people put into the mental representations
p733
aVof near and far future, people begin to make decisions
p734
aVabout the two in the same way.
p735
aVSo, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65
p736
aVis a question that's very different than,
p737
aVimagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,
p738
aVwhat will you look like, how much hair will you have,
p739
aVwho will you be living with.
p740
aVOnce we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,
p741
aVsuddenly we feel like it might be important to save
p742
aVso that that guy has a little retirement money.
p743
aVBut these are tricks around the margins.
p744
aVI think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,
p745
aVwhich is to say, "I'm here today,
p746
aVand so now is more important than later."
p747
