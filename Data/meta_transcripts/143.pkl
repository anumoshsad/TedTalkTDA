VSo I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
p4
aVAnd this is a pretty well-educated audience,
p5
aVso I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
p6
aVYou probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa
p7
aVare infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,
p8
aVand that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
p9
aVIf you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,
p10
aVis the only country in sub-Saharan Africa
p11
aVthat has had success in combating the epidemic.
p12
aVUsing a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms \u2014
p13
aVthe ABC campaign \u2014 they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s
p14
aVfrom about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
p15
aVIf you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago
p16
aVthe president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,
p17
aVand a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda
p18
aVand use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo today I'm going to talk about some things
p21
aVthat you might not know about the epidemic,
p22
aVand I'm actually also going to challenge
p23
aVsome of these things that you think that you do know.
p24
aVTo do that I'm going to talk about my research
p25
aVas an economist on the epidemic.
p26
aVAnd I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
p27
aVI'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
p28
aVBut I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists
p29
aVto think about a problem that's more traditionally
p30
aVpart of public health and epidemiology.
p31
aVAnd I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.
p32
aVHere I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline
p33
aVto think about problems of another.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
p36
aVAnd probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
p37
aVBut this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
p38
aVIt's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
p39
aVI think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,
p40
aVwhich is really the most important,
p41
aVbut I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude
p42
aVthat we actually cannot develop effective policy
p43
aVunless we really understand how the epidemic works.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd the first thing that I want to talk about,
p46
aVthe first thing I think we need to understand is:
p47
aVhow do people respond to the epidemic?
p48
aVSo AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
p49
aVSo this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,
p50
aVthere's a really significant cost of sex.
p51
aVIf you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,
p52
aVif you have one more partner this year \u2014 a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress \u2014
p53
aVyour chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
p54
aa(lp55
VThat is a huge effect.
p56
aVAnd so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
p57
aVAnd in fact among gay men in the US
p58
aVwe did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
p59
aVSo if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,
p60
aV"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"
p61
aVOver a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
p62
aVIt's a huge change in a very short period of time.
p63
aa(lp64
VWe didn't see anything like that in Africa.
p65
aVSo we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here
p66
aVthe share of single men having pre-marital sex,
p67
aVor married men having extra-marital sex,
p68
aVand how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,
p69
aVand late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
p70
aVPeople are learning more things about it.
p71
aVWe see almost no change in sexual behavior.
p72
aVThese are just tiny decreases \u2014 two percentage points \u2014 not significant.
p73
aa(lp74
VThis seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,
p75
aVand that to understand this you need to think about health
p76
aVthe way than an economist does \u2014 as an investment.
p77
aVSo if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about
p78
aVwhether to add some new functionality to your program,
p79
aVit's important to think about how much it costs.
p80
aVIt's also important to think about what the benefit is.
p81
aVAnd one part of that benefit is how much longer
p82
aVyou think this program is going to be active.
p83
aVIf version 10 is coming out next week,
p84
aVthere's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut your health decisions are the same.
p87
aVEvery time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,
p88
aVevery time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,
p89
aVthat's a costly investment in your health.
p90
aVBut how much you want to invest is going to depend
p91
aVon how much longer you expect to live in the future,
p92
aVeven if you don't make those investments.
p93
aVAIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
p94
aVPeople really like to have sex.
p95
aVBut, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
p96
aVBut life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:
p97
aV40 or 50 years in a lot of places.
p98
aVI think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,
p99
aVthat maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut we really need to test that.
p102
aVAnd a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:
p103
aVdo people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
p104
aVAnd the way that I'm going to do that is,
p105
aVI'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
p106
aVSo malaria is a disease that kills you.
p107
aVIt's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
p108
aVAnd so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria
p109
aVare going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
p110
aVSo one way to test to see whether we can explain
p111
aVsome of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy
p112
aVis to look and see is there more behavior change
p113
aVin areas where there's less malaria.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo that's what this figure shows you.
p116
aVThis shows you \u2014 in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria \u2014
p117
aVwhat happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
p118
aVIf you look at the blue line,
p119
aVthe areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,
p120
aVactually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot
p121
aVas HIV prevalence goes up.
p122
aVAreas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some \u2014
p123
aVit doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria \u2014
p124
aVactually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
p125
aa(lp126
VThis is not just through malaria.
p127
aVYoung women who live in areas with high maternal mortality
p128
aVchange their behavior less in response to HIV
p129
aVthan young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
p130
aVThere's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.
p133
aVIt tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut it also tells us something about policy.
p136
aVEven if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,
p137
aVit might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,
p138
aVin combating poor indoor air quality,
p139
aVin improving maternal mortality rates.
p140
aVBecause if you improve those things,
p141
aVthen people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
p142
aVBut it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
p143
aVEducation campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,
p144
aVmay not be enough, at least not alone.
p145
aVIf people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,
p146
aVeven if they know everything about the disease,
p147
aVthey still may not change their behavior.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.
p150
aVPeople aren't changing their behavior enough
p151
aVto decrease the growth in the epidemic.
p152
aVSo we're going to need to think about policy
p153
aVand what kind of policies might be effective.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.
p156
aVThe reason that we know that the ABC campaign
p157
aVwas effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
p158
aVIn Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
p159
aVWe know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
p160
aVIt's not the only place we had any interventions.
p161
aVOther places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places
p162
aVand see what happened to their prevalence?
p163
aa(lp164
VUnfortunately, there's almost no good data
p165
aVon HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
p166
aVSo if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me
p167
aVthe prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"
p168
aVYou get on Google, you Google, and you find,
p169
aVactually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991
p170
aVare STD patients and pregnant women,
p171
aVwhich is not a terribly representative group of people.
p172
aVThen if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,
p173
aVyou'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,
p174
aVbecause in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
p175
aVBut even worse \u2014 some years it's only IV drug users,
p176
aVsome years it's only pregnant women.
p177
aVWe have no way to figure out what happened over time.
p178
aVWe have no consistent testing.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.
p181
aVIn Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,
p182
aVthere's been testing in random samples of the population.
p183
aVBut this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
p184
aVSo I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,
p185
aVbut I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.
p188
aVAnd I started thinking about how else might we figure out
p189
aVwhat the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
p190
aVAnd I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,
p191
aVand we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
p192
aa(lp193
VTo do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact
p194
aVthat AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
p195
aVIt kills people in the prime of their lives.
p196
aVNot a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here \u2014
p197
aVthis is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
p198
aVBotswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,
p199
aVEgypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
p200
aVAnd you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
p201
aVThat suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut in this middle region, between 20 and 45,
p204
aVthe death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
p205
aVBut since there are very few other diseases that kill people,
p206
aVwe can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
p207
aVBut because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,
p208
aVwe can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
p209
aVSo it turns out, if you use this technique,
p210
aVactually your estimates of prevalence are very close
p211
aVto what we get from testing random samples in the population,
p212
aVbut they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,
p215
aVand prevalence based on the mortality data
p216
aVfor the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
p217
aVYou can see, almost without exception,
p218
aVthe UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
p219
aVUNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,
p220
aVand mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
p221
aVAnd these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
p222
aVSo this is another way to see this.
p223
aVYou can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,
p224
aVwe have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000
p225
aVrather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
p226
aa(lp227
VI'm going to talk a little bit in a minute
p228
aVabout how we can use this kind of information to learn something
p229
aVthat's going to help us think about the world.
p230
aVBut this also tells us that one of these facts
p231
aVthat I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
p232
aVIf you think that 25 million people are infected,
p233
aVif you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,
p234
aVmaybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
p235
aVIt doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
p236
aVBut it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
p237
aVWhat I really want to do, is I want to use this new data
p238
aVto try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.
p241
aVWhen I started working on these projects,
p242
aVI was not thinking at all about economics,
p243
aVbut eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
p244
aVSo I am going to talk about exports and prices.
p245
aVAnd I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,
p246
aVin particular export volume, and HIV infections.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar
p249
aVwith the fact that development, that openness to trade,
p250
aVis really good for developing countries.
p251
aVIt's good for improving people's lives.
p252
aVBut openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost
p253
aVwhen we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
p254
aVOn Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett
p255
aVthat I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,
p256
aVand I wouldn't be at all worried about that
p257
aVif we never had any contact with Asia.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.
p260
aVThe epidemic was introduced to the US
p261
aVby actually one male steward on an airline flight,
p262
aVwho got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
p263
aVAnd that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
p264
aVIn Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time
p265
aVthat truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
p266
aVAreas with a lot of economic activity \u2014
p267
aVwith a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization \u2014
p268
aVthose areas have higher prevalence than others.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut that actually doesn't mean at all
p271
aVthat if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
p272
aVBy using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,
p273
aVwe can actually test that. And so it seems to be \u2014
p274
aVfortunately, I think \u2014 it seems to be the case
p275
aVthat these things are positively related.
p276
aVMore exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
p277
aVSo the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,
p278
aVit will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
p281
aVFrom a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,
p282
aVfor example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act
p283
aVor other policies that encourage trade,
p284
aVwe can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
p285
aVAnd we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
p286
aVLikewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,
p287
aVif we know there's this externality \u2014
p288
aVthis extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports \u2014
p289
aVwe can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
p290
aa(lp291
VBut it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
p292
aVEven though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,
p293
aVin the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,
p294
aVit's not necessarily the case that improving poverty \u2014 at least in the short run,
p295
aVthat improving exports and improving development \u2014
p296
aVit's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead
p297
aVto a decline in HIV prevalence.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times
p300
aVthe special case of Uganda, and the fact that
p301
aVit's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
p302
aVIt's been widely heralded.
p303
aVIt's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
p304
aVBut now I want to actually also question that.
p305
aVBecause it is true that there was a decline in prevalence
p306
aVin Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
p307
aVBut there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
p308
aa(lp309
VThere was a big decline in coffee prices.
p310
aVCoffee is Uganda's major export.
p311
aVTheir exports went down a lot in the early 1990s \u2014 and actually that decline lines up
p312
aVreally, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
p313
aVSo you can see that both of these series \u2014
p314
aVthe black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections \u2014
p315
aVyou can see they're both increasing.
p316
aVStarting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
p317
aVAnd then actually they track each other
p318
aVa little bit on the increase later in the decade.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo if you combine the intuition in this figure
p321
aVwith some of the data that I talked about before,
p322
aVit suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent
p323
aVof the decline in prevalence in Uganda
p324
aVactually would have happened even without any education campaign.
p325
aa(lp326
VBut that's enormously important for policy.
p327
aVWe're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
p328
aVAnd if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,
p329
aVthen there are all sorts of other things
p330
aVmaybe we should be spending our money on instead.
p331
aVTrying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
p332
aVTrying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
p333
aVThere are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
p334
aVAnd maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
p335
aa(lp336
VI hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,
p337
aVand I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit
p338
aVsome of the things that you did know.
p339
aVAnd I hope that I've convinced you maybe
p340
aVthat it's important to understand things about the epidemic
p341
aVin order to think about policy.
p342
aa(lp343
VBut more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.
p344
aVAnd when I leave here, I'm going to go back
p345
aVand sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
p346
aVAnd the thing that's most exciting about that
p347
aVis every time I think about research, there are more questions.
p348
aVThere are more things that I think that I want to do.
p349
aVAnd what's really, really great about being here
p350
aVis I'm sure that the questions that you guys have
p351
aVare very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
p352
aVAnd I can't wait to hear about what they are.
