VToday 40 million Americans are indebted for their passage to the new economy.
p4
aVToo poor to pay their way through college,
p5
aVthey now owe lenders more than one trillion US dollars.
p6
aVThey do find what jobs they can get
p7
aVto pay off a debt that is secured on their person.
p8
aVIn America,
p9
aVeven a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance.
p10
aVBut it is nearly impossible
p11
aVfor an American to get discharged their student loan debts.
p12
aa(lp13
VOnce upon a time in America,
p14
aVgoing to college did not mean graduating with debt.
p15
aVMy friend Paul's father graduated from Colorado State University
p16
aVon the GI Bill.
p17
aVFor his generation,
p18
aVhigher education was free or almost free,
p19
aVbecause it was thought of as a public good.
p20
aVNot anymore.
p21
aVWhen Paul also graduated from Colorado State University,
p22
aVhe paid for his English degree by working part-time.
p23
aV30 years ago,
p24
aVhigher education tuition was affordable, reasonable,
p25
aVand what debts you accumulated, you paid off by graduation date.
p26
aVNot anymore.
p27
aVPaul's daughter followed in his footsteps,
p28
aVbut with one difference:
p29
aVwhen she graduated five years ago,
p30
aVit was with a whopping debt.
p31
aa(lp32
VStudents like Kate have to take on a loan
p33
aVbecause the cost of higher education has become unaffordable
p34
aVfor many if not most American families.
p35
aVBut so what?
p36
aVGetting into debt to buy an expensive education
p37
aVis not all bad if you could pay it off
p38
aVwith the increased income that you earned from it.
p39
aVBut that's where the rubber meets the road.
p40
aVEven a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001
p41
aVthan she did in 2013.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo ...
p44
aVtuition costs up,
p45
aVpublic funding down,
p46
aVfamily incomes diminished,
p47
aVpersonal incomes weak.
p48
aVIs it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must
p49
aVcannot make their student loan payments?
p50
aVThe worst of times can be the best of times,
p51
aVbecause certain truths flash up in ways that you can't ignore.
p52
aVI want to speak of three of them today.
p53
aa(lp54
V1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas
p55
aVmake it abundantly obvious
p56
aVthat higher education is a consumer product you can buy.
p57
aVAll of us talk about education just as the economists do now,
p58
aVas an investment that you make to improve the human stock
p59
aVby training them for work.
p60
aVAs an investment you make to sort and classify people
p61
aVso that employers can hire them more easily.
p62
aVThe U.S. News & World Report ranks colleges
p63
aVjust as the consumer report rates washing machines.
p64
aVThe language is peppered with barbarisms.
p65
aVTeachers are called "service providers,"
p66
aVstudents are called "consumers."
p67
aVSociology and Shakespeare and soccer and science,
p68
aVall of these are "content."
p69
aa(lp70
VStudent debt is profitable.
p71
aVOnly not on you.
p72
aVYour debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry.
p73
aVThe two 800-pound gorillas of which \u2014
p74
aVSallie Mae and Navient \u2014
p75
aVposted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars.
p76
aVAnd just like home mortgages,
p77
aVstudent loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced,
p78
aVand sold on Wall Street.
p79
aVAnd colleges and universities
p80
aVthat invest in these securitized loans
p81
aVprofit twice.
p82
aVOnce from your tuition,
p83
aVand then again from the interest on debt.
p84
aa(lp85
VWith all that money to be made,
p86
aVare we surprised that some in the higher education business
p87
aVhave begun to engage in false advertising,
p88
aVin bait and switch ...
p89
aVin exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate?
p90
aa(lp91
VThird:
p92
aVdiplomas are a brand.
p93
aVMany years ago my teacher wrote,
p94
aV"When students are treated as consumers,
p95
aVthey're made prisoners of addiction and envy."
p96
aVJust as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iPhone,
p97
aVso also people can be sold more and more education.
p98
aVCollege is the new high school,
p99
aVwe already say that.
p100
aVBut why stop there?
p101
aVPeople can be upsold on certifications and recertifications,
p102
aVmaster's degrees, doctoral degrees.
p103
aa(lp104
VHigher education is also marketed as a status object.
p105
aVBuy a degree,
p106
aVmuch like you do a Lexus of a Louis Vuitton bag,
p107
aVto distinguish yourself from others.
p108
aVSo you can be the object of envy of others.
p109
aVDiplomas are a brand.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut these truths are often times hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
p112
aVThere is not a day that goes by
p113
aVwithout some policy guy on television telling us,
p114
aV"A college degree is absolutely essential
p115
aVto get on that up escalator to a middle-class life."
p116
aVAnd the usual evidence offered is the college premium:
p117
aVa college grad who makes on average 56 percent more than a high school grad.
p118
aa(lp119
VLet's look at that number more carefully,
p120
aVbecause on the face of it,
p121
aVit seems to belie the stories we all hear
p122
aVabout college grads working as baristas and cashiers.
p123
aVOf 100 people who enroll in any form of post-secondary education,
p124
aV45 do not complete it in a timely fashion,
p125
aVfor a number of reasons, including financial.
p126
aVOf the 55 that do graduate,
p127
aVtwo will remain unemployed,
p128
aVand another 18 are underemployed.
p129
aVSo, college grads earn more than high school grads,
p130
aVbut does it pay for the exorbitant tuition
p131
aVand the lost wages while at college?
p132
aa(lp133
VNow even economists admit
p134
aVgoing to college pays off for only those who complete it.
p135
aVBut that's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone,
p136
aVfor decades now.
p137
aVFor decades,
p138
aVworkers with a high school degree
p139
aVhave been denied a fair share of what they have produced.
p140
aVAnd had they received as they should have,
p141
aVthen going to college would have been a bad investment for many.
p142
aVCollege premium?
p143
aVI think it's a high school discount.
p144
aa(lp145
VTwo out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job.
p146
aVAnd the future, for them, doesn't look particularly promising \u2014
p147
aVin fact, it's downright bleak.
p148
aVAnd it is they who are going to suffer
p149
aVthe most punishing forms of student debt.
p150
aVAnd it is they,
p151
aVcuriously and sadly,
p152
aVwho are marketed most loudly about this college premium thing.
p153
aVThat's not just cynical marketing,
p154
aVthat's cruel.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo what do we do?
p157
aVWhat if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product?
p158
aVEverybody else seems to.
p159
aVThen, like any other consumer product,
p160
aVyou would demand to know what you're paying for.
p161
aVWhen you buy medicines,
p162
aVyou get a list of side effects.
p163
aVWhen you buy a higher educational product,
p164
aVyou should have a warning label
p165
aVthat allows consumers to choose,
p166
aVmake informed choices.
p167
aVWhen you buy a car,
p168
aVit tells you how many miles per gallon to expect.
p169
aVWho knows what to expect
p170
aVfrom a degree say, in Canadian Studies.
p171
aVThere is such a thing, by the way.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhat if there was an app for that?
p174
aVOne that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income.
p175
aVLet's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.
p176
aVOne of you make this.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VDiscover your reality.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VThere are three advantages,
p185
aVthree benefits to Income-Based Tuition.
p186
aVAny user can figure out
p187
aVhow much money he or she will make from a given college and major.
p188
aVSuch informed users
p189
aVare unlikely to fall victim to the huckster's ploy,
p190
aVto the sales pitch.
p191
aVBut also to choose wisely.
p192
aVWhy would anybody pay more for college
p193
aVthan let's say, 15 percent of the additional income they earn?
p194
aa(lp195
VThere's a second benefit to Income-Based Tuition.
p196
aVBy tying the cost to the income,
p197
aVcollege administrators would be forced to manage costs better,
p198
aVto find innovative ways to do so.
p199
aVFor instance,
p200
aVall of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major.
p201
aVThat is manifestly unfair, and should change.
p202
aVAn engineering student uses more resources
p203
aVand facilities and labs and faculty
p204
aVthan a philosophy student.
p205
aVBut the philosophy student, as a consequence,
p206
aVis subsidizing the engineering student.
p207
aVWho then, by the way, goes on and earns more money.
p208
aVWhy should two people buy the same product,
p209
aVpay the same,
p210
aVbut one person receive half or a third of the service.
p211
aVIn fact, college grads, some majors,
p212
aVpay 25 percent of their income servicing their student debt,
p213
aVwhile others pay five percent.
p214
aVThat kind if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow of course, all this data \u2014
p217
aVand one of you is going to do this, right?
p218
aVAll this data has to be well designed,
p219
aVmaybe audited by public accounting firms
p220
aVto avoid statistical lies.
p221
aVWe know about statistics, right?
p222
aa(lp223
VBut be that as it may,
p224
aVthe third and biggest benefit of Income-Based Tuition,
p225
aVis it would free Americans from the fear and the fact of financial ruin
p226
aVbecause they bought a defective product.
p227
aa(lp228
VPerhaps, in time,
p229
aVyoung and old Americans may rediscover,
p230
aVas the gentleman said earlier,
p231
aVtheir curiosity, their love of learning \u2014
p232
aVbegin to study what they love,
p233
aVlove what they study,
p234
aVfollow their passion ...
p235
aVgetting stimulated by their intelligence,
p236
aVfollow paths of inquiry that they really want to.
p237
aa(lp238
VAfter all, it was Eric and Kevin,
p239
aVtwo years ago,
p240
aVjust exactly these kinds of young men,
p241
aVwho prompted me and worked with me,
p242
aVand still do,

aVin the study of indebted students in America.
