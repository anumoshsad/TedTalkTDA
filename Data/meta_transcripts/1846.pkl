VThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough
p4
aVto work with many of the great
p5
aVinternational architects,
p6
aVdocumenting their work and observing
p7
aVhow their designs have the capacity
p8
aVto influence the cities in which they sit.
p9
aVI think of new cities like Dubai
p10
aVor ancient cities like Rome
p11
aVwith Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,
p12
aVor like right here in New York with the High Line,
p13
aVa city which has been so much influenced
p14
aVby the development of this.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut what I find really fascinating
p17
aVis what happens when architects and planners leave
p18
aVand these places become appropriated by people,
p19
aVlike here in Chandigarh, India,
p20
aVthe city which has been completely designed
p21
aVby the architect Le Corbusier.
p22
aVNow 60 years later, the city has been taken over
p23
aVby people in very different ways
p24
aVfrom whatever perhaps intended for,
p25
aVlike here, where you have the people
p26
aVsitting in the windows of the assembly hall.
p27
aVBut over the course of several years,
p28
aVI've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's
p29
aVCCTV building in Beijing
p30
aVand the olympic stadium in the same city
p31
aVby the architects Herzog and de Meuron.
p32
aVAt these large-scale construction sites in China,
p33
aVyou see a sort of makeshift camp
p34
aVwhere workers live during the entire building process.
p35
aVAs the length of the construction takes years,
p36
aVworkers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready
p37
aVinformal city, making for quite a juxtaposition
p38
aVagainst the sophisticated structures that they're building.
p39
aa(lp40
VOver the past seven years, I've been following
p41
aVmy fascination with the built environment,
p42
aVand for those of you who know me, you would say
p43
aVthat this obsession has led me to live
p44
aVout of a suitcase 365 days a year.
p45
aVBeing constantly on the move
p46
aVmeans that sometimes I am able
p47
aVto catch life's most unpredictable moments,
p48
aVlike here in New York
p49
aVthe day after the Sandy storm hit the city.
p50
aa(lp51
VJust over three years ago,
p52
aVI was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,
p53
aVand while flying over the city, I was just amazed
p54
aVby the extent to which the slums
p55
aVreach into every corner of the city,
p56
aVa place where nearly 70 percent of the population
p57
aVlives in slums,
p58
aVdraped literally all over the mountains.
p59
aVDuring a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,
p60
aVI learned about the Torre David,
p61
aVa 45-story office building which sits
p62
aVright in the center of Caracas.
p63
aVThe building was under construction
p64
aVuntil the collapse of the Venezuelan economy
p65
aVand the death of the developer in the early '90s.
p66
aVAbout eight years ago, people started moving
p67
aVinto the abandoned tower
p68
aVand began to build their homes right in between
p69
aVevery column of this unfinished tower.
p70
aVThere's only one little entrance to the entire building,
p71
aVand the 3,000 residents come in and out
p72
aVthrough that single door.
p73
aVTogether, the inhabitants created public spaces
p74
aVand designed them to feel more like a home
p75
aVand less like an unfinished tower.
p76
aVIn the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.
p77
aVThey also made a basketball court.
p78
aVBut when you look up closely,
p79
aVyou see massive holes where elevators
p80
aVand services would have run through.
p81
aa(lp82
VWithin the tower, people have come up
p83
aVwith all sorts of solutions
p84
aVin response to the various needs
p85
aVwhich arise from living in an unfinished tower.
p86
aVWith no elevators,
p87
aVthe tower is like a 45-story walkup.
p88
aVDesigned in very specific ways
p89
aVby this group of people
p90
aVwho haven't had any education in architecture or design.
p91
aVAnd with each inhabitant finding their own
p92
aVunique way of coming by,
p93
aVthis tower becomes like a living city,
p94
aVa place which is alive with micro-economies
p95
aVand small businesses.
p96
aVThe inventive inhabitants, for instance,
p97
aVfind opportunities in the most unexpected cases,
p98
aVlike the adjacent parking garage,
p99
aVwhich has been reclaimed as a taxi route
p100
aVto shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps
p101
aVin order to shorten the hike
p102
aVup to the apartments.
p103
aa(lp104
VA walk through the tower
p105
aVreveals how residents have figured out
p106
aVhow to create walls, how to make an air flow,
p107
aVhow to create transparency,
p108
aVcirculation throughout the tower,
p109
aVessentially creating a home
p110
aVthat's completely adapted
p111
aVto the conditions of the site.
p112
aVWhen a new inhabitant moves into the tower,
p113
aVthey already have a roof over their head,
p114
aVso they just typically mark their space
p115
aVwith a few curtains or sheets.
p116
aVSlowly, from found materials, walls rise,
p117
aVand people create a space out of any found objects
p118
aVor materials.
p119
aa(lp120
VIt's remarkable to see the design decisions
p121
aVthat they're making,
p122
aVlike when everything is made out of red bricks,
p123
aVsome residents will cover that red brick
p124
aVwith another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper
p125
aVjust to make it a kind of clean finish.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe inhabitants literally built up these homes
p128
aVwith their own hands, and this labor of love
p129
aVinstills a great sense of pride
p130
aVin many families living in this tower.
p131
aVThey typically make the best out of their conditions,
p132
aVand try to make their spaces look nice and homey,
p133
aVor at least up until as far as they can reach.
p134
aVThroughout the tower, you come across
p135
aVall kinds of services, like the barber,
p136
aVsmall factories, and every floor has
p137
aVa little grocery store or shop.
p138
aVAnd you even find a church.
p139
aVAnd on the 30th floor, there is a gym
p140
aVwhere all the weights and barbells
p141
aVare made out of the leftover pulleys
p142
aVfrom the elevators which were never installed.
p143
aVFrom the outside, behind this always-changing facade,
p144
aVyou see how the fixed concrete beams
p145
aVprovide a framework for the inhabitants
p146
aVto create their homes
p147
aVin an organic, intuitive way
p148
aVthat responds directly to their needs.
p149
aa(lp150
VLet's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,
p151
aVto a community called Makoko,
p152
aVa slum where 150,000 people
p153
aVlive just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.
p154
aVWhile it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,
p155
aVwhen you see it from above, there seems to be
p156
aVa whole grid of waterways and canals
p157
aVconnecting each and every home.
p158
aVFrom the main dock, people board long wooden canoes
p159
aVwhich carry them out to their various homes and shops
p160
aVlocated in the expansive area.
p161
aVWhen out on the water, it's clear
p162
aVthat life has been completely adapted
p163
aVto this very specific way of living.
p164
aVEven the canoes become variety stores
p165
aVwhere ladies paddle from house to house,
p166
aVselling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.
p167
aVBehind every window and door frame,
p168
aVyou'll see a small child peering back at you,
p169
aVand while Makoko seems to be packed with people,
p170
aVwhat's more shocking is actually
p171
aVthe amount of children pouring out of every building.
p172
aVThe population growth in Nigeria,
p173
aVand especially in these areas like Makoko,
p174
aVare painful reminders
p175
aVof how out of control things really are.
p176
aa(lp177
VIn Makoko, very few systems
p178
aVand infrastructures exist.
p179
aVElectricity is rigged and freshest water
p180
aVcomes from self-built wells throughout the area.
p181
aVThis entire economic model
p182
aVis designed to meet a specific way of living
p183
aVon the water, so fishing and boat-making
p184
aVare common professions.
p185
aVYou'll have a set of entrepreneurs
p186
aVwho have set up businesses throughout the area,
p187
aVlike barbershops, CD and DVD stores,
p188
aVmovie theaters, tailors, everything is there.
p189
aVThere is even a photo studio
p190
aVwhere you see the sort of aspiration
p191
aVto live in a real house or to be associated
p192
aVwith a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.
p193
aa(lp194
VOn this particular evening,
p195
aVI came across this live band
p196
aVdressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.
p197
aVThey were floating through the canals
p198
aVin a large canoe with a fitted-out generator
p199
aVfor all of the community to enjoy.
p200
aa(lp201
VBy nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,
p202
aVsave for a small lightbulb
p203
aVor a fire.
p204
aa(lp205
VWhat originally brought me to Makoko
p206
aVwas this project from a friend of mine,
p207
aVKunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building
p208
aVthis three-story floating school
p209
aVfor the kids in Makoko.
p210
aVWith this entire village existing on the water,
p211
aVpublic space is very limited,
p212
aVso now that the school is finished,
p213
aVthe ground floor is a playground for the kids,
p214
aVbut when classes are out, the platform
p215
aVis just like a town square,
p216
aVwhere the fishermen mend their nets
p217
aVand floating shopkeepers dock their boats.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnother place I'd like to share with you
p220
aVis the Zabbaleen in Cairo.
p221
aVThey're descendants of farmers who began migrating
p222
aVfrom the upper Egypt in the '40s,
p223
aVand today they make their living
p224
aVby collecting and recycling waste from homes
p225
aVfrom all over Cairo.
p226
aVFor years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages
p227
aVwhere they would move around
p228
aVtrying to avoid the local authorities,
p229
aVbut in the early 1980s, they settled
p230
aVon the Mokattam rocks
p231
aVjust at the eastern edge of the city.
p232
aVToday, they live in this area,
p233
aVapproximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,
p234
aVwho live in this community of self-built
p235
aVmulti-story houses
p236
aVwhere up to three generations live in one structure.
p237
aVWhile these apartments that they built for themselves
p238
aVappear to lack any planning or formal grid,
p239
aVeach family specializing in a certain form of recycling
p240
aVmeans that the ground floor of each apartment
p241
aVis reserved for garbage-related activities
p242
aVand the upper floor is dedicated to living space.
p243
aVI find it incredible to see
p244
aVhow these piles and piles of garbage
p245
aVare invisible to the people who live there,
p246
aVlike this very distinguished man who is posing
p247
aVwhile all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,
p248
aVor like these two young men who are sitting
p249
aVand chatting amongst these tons of garbage.
p250
aVWhile to most of us, living amongst
p251
aVthese piles and piles of garbage
p252
aVmay seem totally uninhabitable,
p253
aVto those in the Zabbaleen, this is just
p254
aVa different type of normal.
p255
aVIn all these places I've talked about today,
p256
aVwhat I do find fascinating is that there's really
p257
aVno such thing as normal,
p258
aVand it proves that people are able to adapt
p259
aVto any kind of situation.
p260
aVThroughout the day, it's quite common
p261
aVto come across a small party taking place
p262
aVin the streets, just like this engagement party.
p263
aVIn this tradition, the bride-to-be
p264
aVdisplays all of their belongings,
p265
aVwhich they soon bring to their new husband.
p266
aVA gathering like this one
p267
aVoffers such a juxtaposition
p268
aVwhere all the new stuff is displayed
p269
aVand all the garbage is used
p270
aVas props to display all their new home accessories.
p271
aVLike Makoko and the Torre David,
p272
aVthroughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all
p273
aVthe same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.
p274
aVThere are the retail shops, the cafes
p275
aVand the restaurants, and the community
p276
aVis this community of Coptic Christians,
p277
aVso you'll also find a church,
p278
aValong with the scores of religious iconographies
p279
aVthroughout the area,
p280
aVand also all the everyday services
p281
aVlike the electronic repair shops,
p282
aVthe barbers, everything.
p283
aa(lp284
VVisiting the homes of the Zabbaleen
p285
aVis also full of surprises.
p286
aVWhile from the outside,
p287
aVthese homes look like any other informal structure
p288
aVin the city, when you step inside,
p289
aVyou are met with all manner of design decisions
p290
aVand interior decoration.
p291
aVDespite having limited access to space and money,
p292
aVthe homes in the area are designed
p293
aVwith care and detail.
p294
aVEvery apartment is unique,
p295
aVand this individuality tells a story
p296
aVabout each family's circumstances and values.
p297
aVMany of these people take their homes
p298
aVand interior spaces very seriously,
p299
aVputting a lot of work and care
p300
aVinto the details.
p301
aVThe shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,
p302
aVwhere walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.
p303
aa(lp304
VBut despite this elaborate decor,
p305
aVsometimes these apartments are used
p306
aVin very unexpected ways,
p307
aVlike this home which caught my attention
p308
aVwhile all the mud and the grass was literally
p309
aVseeping out under the front door.
p310
aVWhen I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment
p311
aVwas being transformed into a complete animal farm,
p312
aVwhere six or seven cows stood grazing
p313
aVin what otherwise would be the living room.
p314
aVBut then in the apartment across the hall
p315
aVfrom this cow shed lives a newly married couple
p316
aVin what locals describe
p317
aVas one of the nicest apartments in the area.
p318
aa(lp319
VThe attention to this detail astonished me,
p320
aVand as the owner of the home so proudly
p321
aVled me around this apartment,
p322
aVfrom floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.
p323
aVBut if it weren't for the strangely familiar
p324
aVstomach-churning odor that constantly
p325
aVpasses through the apartment,
p326
aVit would be easy to forget
p327
aVthat you are standing next to a cow shed
p328
aVand on top of a landfill.
p329
aVWhat moved me the most was that despite
p330
aVthese seemingly inhospitable conditions,
p331
aVI was welcomed with open arms
p332
aVinto a home that was made with love, care,
p333
aVand unreserved passion.
p334
aa(lp335
VLet's move across the map to China,
p336
aVto an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.
p337
aVIn a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,
p338
aVthere lived until recently an estimated
p339
aV40 million people in these houses underground.
p340
aVThese dwellings are called the yaodongs.
p341
aVThrough this architecture by subtraction,
p342
aVthese yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.
p343
aVIn these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,
p344
aVand hidden behind these mounds of dirt
p345
aVare these square, rectangular houses
p346
aVwhich sit seven meters below the ground.
p347
aVWhen I asked people why they were digging
p348
aVtheir houses from the ground,
p349
aVthey simply replied that they are poor wheat
p350
aVand apple farmers who didn't have the money
p351
aVto buy materials, and this digging out
p352
aVwas their most logical form of living.
p353
aa(lp354
VFrom Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities
p355
aVhave approached the tasks of planning,
p356
aVdesign and management of their communities
p357
aVand neighborhoods in ways that respond
p358
aVspecifically to their environment and circumstances.
p359
aVCreated by these very people who live,
p360
aVwork and play in these particular spaces,
p361
aVthese neighborhoods are intuitively designed
p362
aVto make the most of their circumstances.
p363
aVIn most of these places, the government
p364
aVis completely absent, leaving inhabitants
p365
aVwith no choice but to reappropriate found materials,
p366
aVand while these communities are highly disadvantaged,
p367
aVthey do present examples
p368
aVof brilliant forms of ingenuity,
p369
aVand prove that indeed we have the ability
p370
aVto adapt to all manner of circumstances.
p371
aVWhat makes places like the Torre David
p372
aVparticularly remarkable
p373
aVis this sort of skeleton framework
p374
aVwhere people can have a foundation
p375
aVwhere they can tap into.
p376
aVNow imagine what these already ingenious communities
p377
aVcould create themselves,
p378
aVand how highly particular their solutions would be,
p379
aVif they were given the basic infrastructures
p380
aVthat they could tap into.
p381
aa(lp382
VToday, you see these large residential development projects
p383
aVwhich offer cookie-cutter housing solutions
p384
aVto massive amounts of people.
p385
aVFrom China to Brazil, these projects attempt
p386
aVto provide as many houses as possible,
p387
aVbut they're completely generic
p388
aVand simply do not work as an answer
p389
aVto the individual needs of the people.
p390
aa(lp391
VI would like to end with a quote
p392
aVfrom a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,
p393
aVZita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful
p394
aVShorefast Foundation,
p395
aVbased out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.
p396
aVShe says that "there's this plague of sameness
p397
aVwhich is killing the human joy,"
p398
aVand I couldn't agree with her more.
p399
aa(lp400
VThank you.
