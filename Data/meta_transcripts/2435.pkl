VAll right, I want to see a show of hands:
p4
aVhow many of you have unfriended someone on Facebook
p5
aVbecause they said something offensive about politics or religion,
p6
aVchildcare, food?
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd how many of you know at least one person that you avoid
p11
aVbecause you just don't want to talk to them?
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VYou know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation,
p16
aVwe just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady":
p17
aVStick to the weather and your health.
p18
aVBut these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects \u2014
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
Vare not safe either.
p23
aVSo this world that we live in,
p24
aVthis world in which every conversation
p25
aVhas the potential to devolve into an argument,
p26
aVwhere our politicians can't speak to one another
p27
aVand where even the most trivial of issues
p28
aVhave someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal.
p29
aVPew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults,
p30
aVand they found that at this moment, we are more polarized,
p31
aVwe are more divided,
p32
aVthan we ever have been in history.
p33
aVWe're less likely to compromise,
p34
aVwhich means we're not listening to each other.
p35
aVAnd we make decisions about where to live,
p36
aVwho to marry and even who our friends are going to be,
p37
aVbased on what we already believe.
p38
aVAgain, that means we're not listening to each other.
p39
aVA conversation requires a balance between talking and listening,
p40
aVand somewhere along the way, we lost that balance.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, part of that is due to technology.
p43
aVThe smartphones that you all either have in your hands
p44
aVor close enough that you could grab them really quickly.
p45
aVAccording to Pew Research,
p46
aVabout a third of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day.
p47
aVAnd many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends
p48
aVthan they are to talk to them face to face.
p49
aVThere's this great piece in The Atlantic.
p50
aVIt was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
p51
aVAnd he gave his kids a communication project.
p52
aVHe wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes.
p53
aVAnd he said this: "I came to realize..."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
V"I came to realize that conversational competence
p58
aVmight be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
p59
aVKids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens,
p60
aVbut rarely do they have an opportunity
p61
aVto hone their interpersonal communications skills.
p62
aVIt might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves:
p63
aVIs there any 21st-century skill
p64
aVmore important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, I make my living talking to people:
p67
aVNobel Prize winners, truck drivers,
p68
aVbillionaires, kindergarten teachers,
p69
aVheads of state, plumbers.
p70
aVI talk to people that I like. I talk to people that I don't like.
p71
aVI talk to some people that I disagree with deeply on a personal level.
p72
aVBut I still have a great conversation with them.
p73
aVSo I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk
p74
aVand how to listen.
p75
aa(lp76
VMany of you have already heard a lot of advice on this,
p77
aVthings like look the person in the eye,
p78
aVthink of interesting topics to discuss in advance,
p79
aVlook, nod and smile to show that you're paying attention,
p80
aVrepeat back what you just heard or summarize it.
p81
aVSo I want you to forget all of that.
p82
aVIt is crap.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VThere is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention
p87
aVif you are in fact paying attention.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer
p94
aVthat I do in regular life.
p95
aVSo, I'm going to teach you how to interview people,
p96
aVand that's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists.
p97
aVLearn to have a conversation
p98
aVwithout wasting your time, without getting bored,
p99
aVand, please God, without offending anybody.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe've all had really great conversations.
p102
aVWe've had them before. We know what it's like.
p103
aVThe kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired,
p104
aVor where you feel like you've made a real connection
p105
aVor you've been perfectly understood.
p106
aVThere is no reason
p107
aVwhy most of your interactions can't be like that.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo I have 10 basic rules. I'm going to walk you through all of them,
p110
aVbut honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it,
p111
aVyou'll already enjoy better conversations.
p112
aa(lp113
VNumber one: Don't multitask.
p114
aVAnd I don't mean just set down your cell phone
p115
aVor your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand.
p116
aVI mean, be present.
p117
aVBe in that moment.
p118
aVDon't think about your argument you had with your boss.
p119
aVDon't think about what you're going to have for dinner.
p120
aVIf you want to get out of the conversation,
p121
aVget out of the conversation,
p122
aVbut don't be half in it and half out of it.
p123
aa(lp124
VNumber two: Don't pontificate.
p125
aVIf you want to state your opinion
p126
aVwithout any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,
p127
aVwrite a blog.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show:
p132
aVBecause they're really boring.
p133
aVIf they're conservative, they're going to hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
p134
aVIf they're liberal, they're going to hate
p135
aVbig banks and oil corporations and Dick Cheney.
p136
aVTotally predictable.
p137
aVAnd you don't want to be like that.
p138
aVYou need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.
p139
aVThe famed therapist M. Scott Peck said
p140
aVthat true listening requires a setting aside of oneself.
p141
aVAnd sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion.
p142
aVHe said that sensing this acceptance,
p143
aVthe speaker will become less and less vulnerable
p144
aVand more and more likely to open up the inner recesses
p145
aVof his or her mind to the listener.
p146
aVAgain, assume that you have something to learn.
p147
aa(lp148
VBill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something that you don't."
p149
aVI put it this way:
p150
aVEverybody is an expert in something.
p151
aa(lp152
VNumber three: Use open-ended questions.
p153
aVIn this case, take a cue from journalists.
p154
aVStart your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how.
p155
aVIf you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out.
p156
aVIf I ask you, "Were you terrified?"
p157
aVyou're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence,
p158
aVwhich is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't."
p159
aV"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
p160
aVLet them describe it. They're the ones that know.
p161
aVTry asking them things like, "What was that like?"
p162
aV"How did that feel?"
p163
aVBecause then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,
p164
aVand you're going to get a much more interesting response.
p165
aa(lp166
VNumber four: Go with the flow.
p167
aVThat means thoughts will come into your mind
p168
aVand you need to let them go out of your mind.
p169
aVWe've heard interviews often
p170
aVin which a guest is talking for several minutes
p171
aVand then the host comes back in and asks a question
p172
aVwhich seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered.
p173
aVThat means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago
p174
aVbecause he thought of this really clever question,
p175
aVand he was just bound and determined to say that.
p176
aVAnd we do the exact same thing.
p177
aVWe're sitting there having a conversation with someone,
p178
aVand then we remember that time that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd we stop listening.
p183
aVStories and ideas are going to come to you.
p184
aVYou need to let them come and let them go.
p185
aa(lp186
VNumber five: If you don't know, say that you don't know.
p187
aVNow, people on the radio, especially on NPR,
p188
aVare much more aware that they're going on the record,
p189
aVand so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in
p190
aVand what they claim to know for sure.
p191
aVDo that. Err on the side of caution.
p192
aVTalk should not be cheap.
p193
aa(lp194
VNumber six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.
p195
aVIf they're talking about having lost a family member,
p196
aVdon't start talking about the time you lost a family member.
p197
aVIf they're talking about the trouble they're having at work,
p198
aVdon't tell them about how much you hate your job.
p199
aVIt's not the same. It is never the same.
p200
aVAll experiences are individual.
p201
aVAnd, more importantly, it is not about you.
p202
aVYou don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are
p203
aVor how much you've suffered.
p204
aVSomebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said,
p205
aV"I have no idea. People who brag about their IQs are losers."
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VConversations are not a promotional opportunity.
p210
aa(lp211
VNumber seven:
p212
aVTry not to repeat yourself.
p213
aVIt's condescending, and it's really boring,
p214
aVand we tend to do it a lot.
p215
aVEspecially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids,
p216
aVwe have a point to make,
p217
aVso we just keep rephrasing it over and over.
p218
aVDon't do that.
p219
aa(lp220
VNumber eight: Stay out of the weeds.
p221
aVFrankly, people don't care
p222
aVabout the years, the names,
p223
aVthe dates, all those details
p224
aVthat you're struggling to come up with in your mind.
p225
aVThey don't care. What they care about is you.
p226
aVThey care about what you're like,
p227
aVwhat you have in common.
p228
aVSo forget the details. Leave them out.
p229
aa(lp230
VNumber nine:
p231
aVThis is not the last one, but it is the most important one.
p232
aVListen.
p233
aVI cannot tell you how many really important people have said
p234
aVthat listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill
p235
aVthat you could develop.
p236
aVBuddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,
p237
aV"If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
p238
aVAnd Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job."
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VWhy do we not listen to each other?
p243
aVNumber one, we'd rather talk.
p244
aVWhen I'm talking, I'm in control.
p245
aVI don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in.
p246
aVI'm the center of attention.
p247
aVI can bolster my own identity.
p248
aVBut there's another reason:
p249
aVWe get distracted.
p250
aVThe average person talks at about 225 word per minute,
p251
aVbut we can listen at up to 500 words per minute.
p252
aVSo our minds are filling in those other 275 words.
p253
aVAnd look, I know, it takes effort and energy
p254
aVto actually pay attention to someone,
p255
aVbut if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation.
p256
aVYou're just two people shouting out barely related sentences
p257
aVin the same place.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VYou have to listen to one another.
p262
aVStephen Covey said it very beautifully.
p263
aVHe said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand.
p264
aVWe listen with the intent to reply."
p265
aa(lp266
VOne more rule, number 10, and it's this one: Be brief.
p267
aa(lp268
V[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest,
p269
aVbut long enough to cover the subject. \u2014 My Sister]
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aVAll of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one:
p275
aVBe interested in other people.
p276
aa(lp277
VYou know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather,
p278
aVand there was kind of a ritual in my home.
p279
aVPeople would come over to talk to my grandparents,
p280
aVand after they would leave, my mother would come over to us,
p281
aVand she'd say, "Do you know who that was?
p282
aVShe was the runner-up to Miss America.
p283
aVHe was the mayor of Sacramento.
p284
aVShe won a Pulitzer Prize. He's a Russian ballet dancer."
p285
aVAnd I kind of grew up assuming
p286
aVeveryone has some hidden, amazing thing about them.
p287
aVAnd honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host.
p288
aVI keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can,
p289
aVI keep my mind open,
p290
aVand I'm always prepared to be amazed,
p291
aVand I'm never disappointed.
p292
aa(lp293
VYou do the same thing.
p294
aVGo out, talk to people,
p295
aVlisten to people,
p296
aVand, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed.
p297
aa(lp298
VThanks.
