VWhen I turned 19, I started my career

aVas the first female photojournalist
p5
aVin the Gaza Strip, Palestine.
p6
aVMy work as a woman photographer
p7
aVwas considered a serious insult
p8
aVto local traditions,
p9
aVand created a lasting stigma
p10
aVfor me and my family.
p11
aVThe male-dominated field made my presence
p12
aVunwelcome by all possible means.
p13
aVThey made clear that a woman
p14
aVmust not do a man's job.
p15
aVPhoto agencies in Gaza refused to train me
p16
aVbecause of my gender.
p17
aVThe "No" sign was pretty clear.
p18
aa(lp19
VThree of my colleagues
p20
aVwent as far as to drive me to an open air strike area
p21
aVwhere the explosion sounds
p22
aVwere the only thing I could hear.
p23
aVDust was flying in the air,
p24
aVand the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.
p25
aVI only realized we weren't there to document the event
p26
aVwhen the three of them got back into the armored Jeep
p27
aVand drove away, waving and laughing,
p28
aVleaving me behind in the open air strike zone.
p29
aa(lp30
VFor a moment, I felt terrified,
p31
aVhumiliated, and sorry for myself.
p32
aVMy colleagues' action was not
p33
aVthe only death threat I have received,
p34
aVbut it was the most dangerous one.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe perception of women's life in Gaza
p37
aVis passive.
p38
aVUntil a recent time, a lot of  women were not allowed
p39
aVto work or pursue education.
p40
aVAt times of such doubled war including
p41
aVboth social restrictions on women
p42
aVand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
p43
aVwomen's dark and bright stories were fading away.
p44
aVTo men, women's stories were seen
p45
aVas inconsequential.
p46
aa(lp47
VI started paying closer attention
p48
aVto women's lives in Gaza.
p49
aVBecause of my gender, I had access
p50
aVto worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.
p51
aVBeyond the obvious pain and struggle,
p52
aVthere was a healthy dose
p53
aVof laughter and accomplishments.
p54
aVIn front of a police compound in Gaza City
p55
aVduring the first war in Gaza,
p56
aVan Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound
p57
aVand break my nose.
p58
aVFor a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,
p59
aVlike these lights.
p60
aVI thought to myself I either got blind
p61
aVor I was in heaven.
p62
aVBy the time I managed to open my eyes,
p63
aVI had documented this moment.

p67
aVas his retirement plan,

aVthe house was flattened to the ground.
p71
aVNothing was left but the pigeons he raised
p72
aVand a jacuzzi, a bathtub
p73
aVthat he got from Tel Aviv.

aVMohammed got the bathtub
p75
aVon the top of the rubble
p76
aVand started giving his kids
p77
aVan every morning bubble bath.
p78
aa(lp79
VMy work is not meant to hide the scars of war,
p80
aVbut to show the full frame
p81
aVof unseen stories of Gazans.
p82
aVAs a Palestinian female photographer,
p83
aVthe journey of struggle, survival and everyday life
p84
aVhas inspired me to overcome the community taboo

aVand see a different side of war and its aftermath.
