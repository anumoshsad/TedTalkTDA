VThis is Revolution 2.0.
p4
aVNo one was a hero. No one was a hero.
p5
aVBecause everyone was a hero.
p6
aVEveryone has done something.
p7
aVWe all use Wikipedia.
p8
aVIf you think of the concept of Wikipedia
p9
aVwhere everyone is collaborating on content,
p10
aVand at the end of the day
p11
aVyou've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.
p12
aVFrom just an idea that sounded crazy,
p13
aVyou have the largest encyclopedia in the world.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd in the Egyptian revolution,
p16
aVthe Revolution 2.0,
p17
aVeveryone has contributed something,
p18
aVsmall or big. They contributed something \u2014
p19
aVto bring us
p20
aVone of the most inspiring stories
p21
aVin the history of mankind
p22
aVwhen it comes to revolutions.
p23
aVIt was actually really inspiring
p24
aVto see all these Egyptians completely changing.
p25
aVIf you look at the scene,
p26
aVEgypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill \u2014
p27
aVgoing into a downhill.
p28
aVEverything was going bad.
p29
aVEverything was going wrong.
p30
aVWe only ranked high when it comes to poverty,
p31
aVcorruption,
p32
aVlack of freedom of speech,
p33
aVlack of political activism.
p34
aVThose were the achievements
p35
aVof our great regime.
p36
aVYet, nothing was happening.
p37
aVAnd it's not because people were happy
p38
aVor people were not frustrated.
p39
aVIn fact, people were extremely frustrated.
p40
aVBut the reason why everyone was silent
p41
aVis what I call the psychological barrier of fear.
p42
aVEveryone was scared.
p43
aVNot everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians
p44
aVthat I have to thank for being so brave \u2014
p45
aVgoing into protests as a couple of hundred,
p46
aVgetting beaten up and arrested.
p47
aVBut in fact, the majority were scared.
p48
aVEveryone did not want really
p49
aVto get in trouble.
p50
aa(lp51
VA dictator cannot live without the force.
p52
aVThey want to make people live in fear.
p53
aVAnd that psychological barrier of fear
p54
aVhad worked for so many years,
p55
aVand here comes the Internet,
p56
aVtechnology, BlackBerry, SMS.
p57
aVIt's helping all of us to connect.
p58
aVPlatforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook
p59
aVwere helping us a lot
p60
aVbecause it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.
p61
aVThere are a lot of people who are frustrated."
p62
aVThere are lots of people who are frustrated.
p63
aVThere are lots of people who actually share the same dream.
p64
aVThere are lots of people who care about their freedom.
p65
aVThey probably have the best life in the world.
p66
aVThey are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.
p67
aVThey are happy. They don't have problems.
p68
aVBut they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.
p69
aa(lp70
VA lot of us, we're not really happy
p71
aVwhen we see a video of an Egyptian man
p72
aVwho's eating the trash
p73
aVwhile others are stealing
p74
aVbillions of Egyptian pounds
p75
aVfrom the wealth of the country.
p76
aVThe Internet has played a great role,
p77
aVhelping these people to speak up their minds,
p78
aVto collaborate together, to start thinking together.
p79
aVIt was an educational campaign.
p80
aa(lp81
VKhaled Saeed was killed
p82
aVin June 2010.
p83
aVI still remember the photo.
p84
aVI still remember every single detail of that photo.
p85
aVThe photo was horrible.
p86
aVHe was tortured,
p87
aVbrutally tortured to death.
p88
aVBut then what was the answer of the regime?
p89
aV"He choked on a pile of hash" \u2014
p90
aVthat was their answer:
p91
aV"He's a criminal.
p92
aVHe's someone who escaped from all these bad things."
p93
aVBut people did not relate to this.
p94
aVPeople did not believe this.
p95
aVBecause of the Internet, the truth prevailed
p96
aVand everyone knew the truth.
p97
aVAnd everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."
p98
aVHe was a middle-class guy.
p99
aVHis photo was remembered by all of us.
p100
aa(lp101
VA page was created.
p102
aVAn anonymous administrator
p103
aVwas basically inviting people to join the page,
p104
aVand there was no plan.
p105
aV"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."
p106
aVIn a few days, tens of thousands of people there \u2014
p107
aVangry Egyptians
p108
aVwho were asking the ministry of interior affairs,
p109
aV"Enough.
p110
aVGet those who killed this guy.
p111
aVTo just bring them to justice."
p112
aVBut of course, they don't listen.
p113
aVIt was an amazing story \u2014
p114
aVhow everyone started feeling the ownership.
p115
aVEveryone was an owner in this page.
p116
aVPeople started contributing ideas.
p117
aVIn fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas
p118
aVwas, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.
p119
aVLet's get people to go in the street,
p120
aVface the sea, their back to the street,
p121
aVdressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,
p122
aVdoing nothing and then just leaving,
p123
aVgoing back home."
p124
aVFor some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.
p125
aVAnd next time it's going to be vibration."
p126
aVPeople were making fun of the idea.
p127
aVBut actually when people went to the street \u2014
p128
aVthe first time it was thousands of people
p129
aVin Alexandria \u2014
p130
aVit felt like \u2014 it was amazing. It was great
p131
aVbecause it connected people from the virtual world,
p132
aVbringing them to the real world,
p133
aVsharing the same dream,
p134
aVthe same frustration, the same anger,
p135
aVthe same desire for freedom.
p136
aVAnd they were doing this thing.
p137
aVBut did the regime learn anything? Not really.
p138
aVThey were actually attacking them.
p139
aVThey were actually abusing them,
p140
aVdespite the fact of how peaceful these guys were \u2014
p141
aVthey were not even protesting.
p142
aVAnd things had developed
p143
aVuntil the Tunisian revolution.
p144
aa(lp145
VThis whole page was, again,
p146
aVmanaged by the people.
p147
aVIn fact, the anonymous admin job
p148
aVwas to collect ideas,
p149
aVhelp people to vote on them
p150
aVand actually tell them what they are doing.
p151
aVPeople were taking shots and photos;
p152
aVpeople were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;
p153
aVpeople were suggesting ideas,
p154
aVthey were actually voting on ideas,
p155
aVand then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.
p156
aVEverything was done by the people to the people,
p157
aVand that's the power of the Internet.
p158
aVThere was no leader.
p159
aVThe leader was everyone on that page.
p160
aVThe Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,
p161
aVinspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.
p162
aVYes we can. We can do it.
p163
aVWe have the same problems;
p164
aVwe can just go in the streets.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd when I saw the street on the 25th,
p167
aVI went back and said,
p168
aV"Egypt before the 25th
p169
aVis never going to be Egypt after the 25th.
p170
aVThe revolution is happening.
p171
aVThis is not the end,
p172
aVthis is the beginning of the end."
p173
aVI was detained on the 27th night.
p174
aVThank God I announced the locations and everything.
p175
aVBut they detained me.
p176
aVAnd I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.
p177
aVI was detained for 12 days,
p178
aVblindfolded, handcuffed.
p179
aVAnd I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.
p180
aVI was not allowed to speak with anyone.
p181
aVAnd I went out.
p182
aVThe next day I was in Tahrir.
p183
aVSeriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,
p184
aVI thought it was 12 years.
p185
aVI never had in my mind
p186
aVto see this Egyptian,
p187
aVthe amazing Egyptian.
p188
aVThe fear is no longer fear.
p189
aVIt's actually strength \u2014 it's power.
p190
aVPeople were so empowered.
p191
aVIt was amazing how everyone was so empowered
p192
aVand now asking for their rights.
p193
aVCompletely opposite.
p194
aVExtremism became tolerance.
p195
aa(lp196
VWho would [have] imagined before the 25th,
p197
aVif I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray
p198
aVand tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,
p199
aVand then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray
p200
aVand tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them \u2014
p201
aVthis is amazing.
p202
aVAll the stereotypes
p203
aVthat the regime was trying to put on us
p204
aVthrough their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,
p205
aVare proven wrong.
p206
aVThis whole revolution showed us
p207
aVhow ugly such a regime was
p208
aVand how great and amazing
p209
aVthe Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,
p210
aVhow simple and amazing these people are
p211
aVwhenever they have a dream.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhen I saw that,
p214
aVI went back and I wrote on Facebook.
p215
aVAnd that was a personal belief,
p216
aVregardless of what's going on,
p217
aVregardless of the details.
p218
aVI said that, "We are going to win.
p219
aVWe are going to win because we don't understand politics.
p220
aVWe're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
p221
aVWe're going to win because we don't have an agenda.
p222
aVWe're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes
p223
aVactually come from our hearts.
p224
aVWe're going to win because we have dreams.
p225
aVWe're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."
p226
aVAnd that's actually what happened. We won.
p227
aVAnd that's not because of anything,
p228
aVbut because we believed in our dream.
p229
aVThe winning here is not
p230
aVthe whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.
p231
aVThe winning is the winning of the dignity
p232
aVof every single Egyptian.
p233
aa(lp234
VActually, I had this taxi driver telling me,
p235
aV"Listen, I am breathing freedom.
p236
aVI feel that I have dignity
p237
aVthat I have lost for so many years."
p238
aVFor me that's winning,
p239
aVregardless of all the details.
p240
aa(lp241
VMy last word to you is a statement I believe in,
p242
aVwhich Egyptians have proven to be true,
p243
aVthat the power of the people
p244
aVis much stronger than the people in power.
p245
aa(lp246
VThanks a lot.
