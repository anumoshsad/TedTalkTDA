VWhat I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so
p4
aVis tell you about an idea
p5
aVof how we're going to make matter come alive.
p6
aVNow this may seem a bit ambitious,
p7
aVbut when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,
p8
aVyou realize that you're alive.
p9
aVSo this is a start.
p10
aVNow this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.
p11
aVThere's been four billion years
p12
aVof organic, biological life.
p13
aVAnd as an inorganic chemist,
p14
aVmy friends and colleagues make this distinction
p15
aVbetween the organic, living world
p16
aVand the inorganic, dead world.
p17
aVAnd what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas
p18
aVabout how we can transform inorganic, dead matter
p19
aVinto living matter, into inorganic biology.
p20
aa(lp21
VBefore we do that,
p22
aVI want to kind of put biology in its place.
p23
aVAnd I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.
p24
aVI love to do synthetic biology.
p25
aVI love things that are alive.
p26
aVI love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.
p27
aVBut within that infrastructure,
p28
aVwe have to remember
p29
aVthat the driving force of biology
p30
aVis really coming from evolution.
p31
aVAnd evolution,
p32
aValthough it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin
p33
aVand a vast number of other people,
p34
aVevolution still is a little bit intangible.
p35
aVAnd when I talk about Darwinian evolution,
p36
aVI mean one thing and one thing only,
p37
aVand that is survival of the fittest.
p38
aVAnd so forget about evolution
p39
aVin a kind of metaphysical way.
p40
aVThink about evolution
p41
aVin terms of offspring competing,
p42
aVand some winning.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo bearing that in mind,
p45
aVas a chemist, I wanted to ask myself
p46
aVthe question frustrated by biology:
p47
aVWhat is the minimal unit of matter
p48
aVthat can undergo Darwinian evolution?
p49
aVAnd this seems quite a profound question.
p50
aVAnd as a chemist,
p51
aVwe're not used to profound questions every day.
p52
aVSo when I thought about it,
p53
aVthen suddenly I realized
p54
aVthat biology gave us the answer.
p55
aVAnd in fact, the smallest unit of matter
p56
aVthat can evolve independently
p57
aVis, in fact, a single cell \u2014
p58
aVa bacteria.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo this raises three really important questions:
p61
aVWhat is life?
p62
aVIs biology special?
p63
aVBiologists seem to think so.
p64
aVIs matter evolvable?
p65
aVNow if we answer those questions in reverse order,
p66
aVthe third question \u2014 is matter evolvable? \u2014
p67
aVif we can answer that,
p68
aVthen we're going to know how special biology is,
p69
aVand maybe, just maybe,
p70
aVwe'll have some idea of what life really is.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo here's some inorganic life.
p73
aVThis is a dead crystal,
p74
aVand I'm going to do something to it,
p75
aVand it's going to become alive.
p76
aVAnd you can see,
p77
aVit's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.
p78
aVThis is an inorganic tube.
p79
aVAnd all these crystals here under the microscope
p80
aVwere dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.
p81
aVOf course, they're not alive.
p82
aVIt's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.
p83
aVBut when I saw this, I was really fascinated,
p84
aVbecause it seemed lifelike.
p85
aVAnd as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.
p86
aVYou can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.
p87
aVAnd this is dead.
p88
aVSo I was positive that,
p89
aVif somehow we can make things mimic life,
p90
aVlet's go one step further.
p91
aVLet's see if we can actually make life.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut there's a problem,
p94
aVbecause up until maybe a decade ago,
p95
aVwe were told that life was impossible
p96
aVand that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.
p97
aVIn fact, we were the only people
p98
aVin the universe.
p99
aVNow, that's a bit boring.
p100
aVSo as a chemist,
p101
aVI wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?
p102
aVIs life that improbable?"
p103
aVAnd this is really the question.
p104
aVI think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells
p105
aVwas as probable as the emergence of the stars.
p106
aVAnd in fact, let's take that one step further.
p107
aVLet's say
p108
aVthat if the physics of fusion
p109
aVis encoded into the universe,
p110
aVmaybe the physics of life is as well.
p111
aVAnd so the problem with chemists \u2014
p112
aVand this is a massive advantage as well \u2014
p113
aVis we like to focus on our elements.
p114
aVIn biology, carbon takes center stage.
p115
aVAnd in a universe where carbon exists
p116
aVand organic biology,
p117
aVthen we have all this wonderful diversity of life.
p118
aVIn fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.
p119
aVWe're awfully careful in the lab
p120
aVto try and avoid various biohazards.
p121
aa(lp122
VWell what about matter?
p123
aVIf we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?
p124
aVSo think, this is a serious question.
p125
aVIf your pen could replicate,
p126
aVthat would be a bit of a problem.
p127
aVSo we have to think differently
p128
aVif we're going to make stuff come alive.
p129
aVAnd we also have to be aware of the issues.
p130
aVBut before we can make life,
p131
aVlet's think for a second
p132
aVwhat life really is characterized by.
p133
aVAnd forgive the complicated diagram.
p134
aVThis is just a collection of pathways in the cell.
p135
aVAnd the cell is obviously for us
p136
aVa fascinating thing.
p137
aVSynthetic biologists are manipulating it.
p138
aVChemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.
p139
aVAnd you have all these pathways going on at the same time.
p140
aVYou have regulation;
p141
aVinformation is transcribed;
p142
aVcatalysts are made; stuff is happening.
p143
aVBut what does a cell do?
p144
aVWell it divides, it competes,
p145
aVit survives.
p146
aVAnd I think that is where we have to start
p147
aVin terms of thinking about
p148
aVbuilding from our ideas in life.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut what else is life characterized by?
p151
aVWell, I like think of it
p152
aVas a flame in a bottle.
p153
aVAnd so what we have here
p154
aVis a description of single cells
p155
aVreplicating, metabolizing,
p156
aVburning through chemistries.
p157
aVAnd so we have to understand
p158
aVthat if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,
p159
aVwe need to power it somehow.
p160
aVSo before we can really start to make life,
p161
aVwe have to really think about where it came from.
p162
aVAnd Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague
p163
aVthat he thought that life probably emerged
p164
aVin some warm little pond somewhere \u2014
p165
aVmaybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,
p166
aVmaybe somewhere else.
p167
aVBut the real honest answer is, we just don't know,
p168
aVbecause there is a problem with the origin.
p169
aVImagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,
p170
aVthere is a vast chemical soup of stuff.
p171
aVAnd from this stuff we came.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo when you think about the improbable nature
p174
aVof what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,
p175
aVjust remember,
p176
aVwe came from stuff on planet Earth.
p177
aVAnd we went through a variety of worlds.
p178
aVThe RNA people would talk about the RNA world.
p179
aVWe somehow got to proteins and DNA.
p180
aVWe then got to the last ancestor.
p181
aVEvolution kicked in \u2014 and that's the cool bit.
p182
aVAnd here we are.
p183
aVBut there's a roadblock that you can't get past.
p184
aVYou can decode the genome, you can look back,
p185
aVyou can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,
p186
aVbut we can't get further than the last ancestor,
p187
aVthe last visible cell
p188
aVthat we could sequence or think back in history.
p189
aVSo we don't know how we got here.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo there are two options:
p192
aVintelligent design, direct and indirect \u2014
p193
aVso God,
p194
aVor my friend.
p195
aVNow talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,
p196
aVjust pushes the problem further on.
p197
aVI'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.
p198
aVThe other thing we need to think about
p199
aVis the emergence of chemical complexity.
p200
aVThis seems most likely.
p201
aVSo we have some kind of primordial soup.
p202
aVAnd this one happens to be
p203
aVa good source of all 20 amino acids.
p204
aVAnd somehow
p205
aVthese amino acids are combined,
p206
aVand life begins.
p207
aVBut life begins, what does that mean?
p208
aVWhat is life? What is this stuff of life?
p209
aa(lp210
VSo in the 1950s,
p211
aVMiller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,
p212
aVwhere they did the equivalent in the chemical world.
p213
aVThey took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar
p214
aVand ignited them
p215
aVand put a lot of voltage through.
p216
aVAnd they had a look at what was in the soup,
p217
aVand they found amino acids,
p218
aVbut nothing came out, there was no cell.
p219
aVSo the whole area's been stuck for a while,
p220
aVand it got reignited in the '80s
p221
aVwhen analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.
p222
aa(lp223
VIn my own laboratory,
p224
aVthe way we're trying to create inorganic life
p225
aVis by using many different reaction formats.
p226
aVSo what we're trying to do is do reactions \u2014
p227
aVnot in one flask, but in tens of flasks,
p228
aVand connect them together,
p229
aVas you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.
p230
aVWe can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,
p231
aVwe can do it in a 3D printer,
p232
aVwe can do it in droplets for colleagues.
p233
aVAnd the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry
p234
aVjust bubbling away.
p235
aVBut that's probably going to end in failure,
p236
aVso we need to be a bit more focused.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd the answer, of course, lies with mice.
p239
aVThis is how I remember what I need as a chemist.
p240
aVI say, "Well I want molecules."
p241
aVBut I need a metabolism, I need some energy.
p242
aVI need some information, and I need a container.
p243
aVBecause if I want evolution,
p244
aVI need containers to compete.
p245
aVSo if you have a container,
p246
aVit's like getting in your car.
p247
aV"This is my car,
p248
aVand I'm going to drive around and show off my car."
p249
aVAnd I imagine you have a similar thing
p250
aVin cellular biology
p251
aVwith the emergence of life.
p252
aVSo these things together give us evolution, perhaps.
p253
aVAnd the way to test it in the laboratory
p254
aVis to make it minimal.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo what we're going to try and do
p257
aVis come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.
p258
aVAnd so forgive the molecules on the screen,
p259
aVbut these are a very simple kit.
p260
aVThere's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.
p261
aVAnd we can aggregate them together
p262
aVand make literally thousands and thousands
p263
aVof really big nano-molecular molecules
p264
aVthe same size of DNA and proteins,
p265
aVbut there's no carbon in sight.
p266
aVCarbon is banned.
p267
aVAnd so with this Lego kit,
p268
aVwe have the diversity required
p269
aVfor complex information storage
p270
aVwithout DNA.
p271
aVBut we need to make some containers.
p272
aVAnd just a few months ago in my lab,
p273
aVwe were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.
p274
aVAnd you can see on the screen a cell being made.
p275
aVAnd we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.
p276
aVAnd all I wanted to show you
p277
aVis we can set up molecules
p278
aVin membranes, in real cells,
p279
aVand then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,
p280
aVa molecular survival of the fittest.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd this movie here
p283
aVshows this competition between molecules.
p284
aVMolecules are competing for stuff.
p285
aVThey're all made of the same stuff,
p286
aVbut they want their shape to win.
p287
aVThey want their shape to persist.
p288
aVAnd that is the key.
p289
aVIf we can somehow encourage these molecules
p290
aVto talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,
p291
aVthey will start to form cells
p292
aVthat will replicate and compete.
p293
aVIf we manage to do that,
p294
aVforget the molecular detail.
p295
aa(lp296
VLet's zoom out to what that could mean.
p297
aVSo we have this special theory of evolution
p298
aVthat applies only to organic biology, to us.
p299
aVIf we could get evolution into the material world,
p300
aVthen I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.
p301
aVAnd that's really worth thinking about.
p302
aVDoes evolution control
p303
aVthe sophistication of matter in the universe?
p304
aVIs there some driving force through evolution
p305
aVthat allows matter to compete?
p306
aVSo that means we could then start
p307
aVto develop different platforms
p308
aVfor exploring this evolution.
p309
aVSo you imagine,
p310
aVif we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,
p311
aVnot only will this tell us about the origin of life \u2014
p312
aVthat it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;
p313
aVit can use anything \u2014
p314
aVwe can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,
p315
aVbecause we can then use software control
p316
aVfor evolution to code in.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo imagine we make a little cell.
p319
aVWe want to put it out in the environment,
p320
aVand we want it to be powered by the Sun.
p321
aVWhat we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
p322
aVAnd we don't use design anymore. We find what works.
p323
aVWe should take our inspiration from biology.
p324
aVBiology doesn't care about the design
p325
aVunless it works.
p326
aVSo this will reorganize
p327
aVthe way we design things.
p328
aVBut not only just that,
p329
aVwe will start to think about
p330
aVhow we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.
p331
aVWouldn't it be great
p332
aVif you could take these artificial biological cells
p333
aVand fuse them with biological ones
p334
aVto correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?
p335
aVThe real issue in cellular biology
p336
aVis we are never going to understand everything,
p337
aVbecause it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.
p338
aVEvolution cannot be cut apart.
p339
aVYou need to somehow find the fitness function.
p340
aVAnd the profound realization for me
p341
aVis that, if this works,
p342
aVthe concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,
p343
aVand we really start talking about selfish matter.
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd what does that mean in a universe
p346
aVwhere we are right now the highest form of stuff?
p347
aVYou're sitting on chairs.
p348
aVThey're inanimate, they're not alive.
p349
aVBut you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,
p350
aVand you enslave stuff.
p351
aVSo using evolution
p352
aVin biology,
p353
aVand in inorganic biology,
p354
aVfor me is quite appealing, quite exciting.
p355
aVAnd we're really becoming very close
p356
aVto understanding the key steps
p357
aVthat makes dead stuff come alive.
p358
aVAnd again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,
p359
aVremember, five billion years ago,
p360
aVwe were not here, and there was no life.
p361
aVSo what will that tell us
p362
aa(lp363
Vabout the origin of life and the meaning of life?
p364
aVBut perhaps, for me as a chemist,
p365
aVI want to keep away from general terms;
p366
aVI want to think about specifics.
p367
aVSo what does it mean about defining life?
p368
aVWe really struggle to do this.
p369
aVAnd I think, if we can make inorganic biology,
p370
aVand we can make matter become evolvable,
p371
aVthat will in fact define life.
p372
aVI propose to you
p373
aVthat matter that can evolve is alive,
p374
aVand this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter.
p375
aa(lp376
VThank you very much.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VChris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.
p381
aVYou believe you're going to be successful in this project?
p382
aVWhen?
p383
aa(lp384
VLee Cronin: So many people think
p385
aVthat life took millions of years to kick in.
p386
aVWe're proposing to do it in just a few hours,
p387
aVonce we've set up
p388
aVthe right chemistry.
p389
aa(lp390
VCA: And when do you think that will happen?
p391
aa(lp392
VLC: Hopefully within the next two years.
p393
aa(lp394
VCA: That would be a big story.
p395
aV(Laughter)
p396
aVIn your own mind, what do you believe the chances are
p397
aVthat walking around on some other planet
p398
aVis non-carbon-based life,
p399
aVwalking or oozing or something?
p400
aa(lp401
VLC: I think it's 100 percent.
p402
aVBecause the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,
p403
aVif you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.
p404
aVSo the other thing
p405
aVthat if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,
p406
aVmaybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.
p407
aVDon't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff.
p408
aa(lp409
VCA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.)
