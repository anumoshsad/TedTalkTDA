VThe word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has,
p4
aVand I know this personally.
p5
aVI played 10 years of football,
p6
aVwas struck in the head thousands of times.
p7
aVAnd I have to tell you, though, what was much worse than that
p8
aVwas a pair of bike accidents I had where I suffered concussions,
p9
aVand I'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one
p10
aVtoday as I stand in front of you.
p11
aa(lp12
VThere is a fear around concussion
p13
aVthat does have some evidence behind it.
p14
aVThere is information that a repeated history of concussion
p15
aVcan lead to early dementia, such as Alzheimer's,
p16
aVand chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
p17
aVThat was the subject of the Will Smith movie "Concussion."
p18
aVAnd so everybody is caught up in football and what they see in the military,
p19
aVbut you may not know
p20
aVthat bike riding is the leading cause of concussion for kids,
p21
aVsports-related concussion, that is.
p22
aVAnd so another thing that I should tell you
p23
aVthat you may not know
p24
aVis that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football
p25
aVand many activities,
p26
aVthey're not designed or tested
p27
aVfor how well they can protect your children against concussion.
p28
aVThey're in fact designed and tested
p29
aVfor their ability to protect against skull fracture.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so I get this question all the time from parents,
p32
aVand they ask me,
p33
aV"Would you let your own child play football?"
p34
aVOr, "Should I let my child play soccer?"
p35
aVAnd I think that as a field,
p36
aVwe're a long way from giving an answer with any kind of confidence there.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I look at that question from a bit of a different lens,
p39
aVand I want to know, how can we prevent concussion?
p40
aVIs that even possible?
p41
aVAnd most experts think that it's not,
p42
aVbut the work that we're doing in my lab
p43
aVis starting to reveal more of the details around concussion
p44
aVso that we can have a better understanding.
p45
aVThe reason we're able to prevent skull fracture with helmets
p46
aVis because it's pretty simple. We know how it works.
p47
aVConcussion has been much more of a mystery.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo to give you a sense of what might be happening in a concussion,
p50
aVI want to show you the video here
p51
aVthat you see when you type into Google,
p52
aV"What is a concussion?"
p53
aVThe CDC website comes up,
p54
aVand this video essentially tells the whole story.
p55
aVWhat you see is the head moves forward,
p56
aVthe brain lags behind,
p57
aVthen the brain catches up
p58
aVand smashes into the skull.
p59
aVIt rebounds off the skull
p60
aVand then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull.
p61
aVAnd what you'll notice is highlighted in this video from the CDC,
p62
aVwhich I'll note was funded by the NFL,
p63
aVis that the outer surface of the brain,
p64
aVwhere it was to have smashed into the skull,
p65
aVlooks like it's been damaged or injured, so it's on the outer surface of the brain.
p66
aVAnd what I'd like to do with this video
p67
aVis to tell you that there are some aspects that are probably right,
p68
aVindicative of what the scientists think happens with concussion,
p69
aVbut there's probably more that's wrong with this video.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo one thing that I do agree with, and I think most experts would,
p72
aVis that the brain does have these dynamics.
p73
aVIt does lag behind the skull
p74
aVand then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate.
p75
aVThat we think is true.
p76
aVHowever, the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video
p77
aVis probably not right at all.
p78
aVThere's very little room in the cranial vault,
p79
aVonly a few millimeters,
p80
aVand it's filled entirely with cerebral spinal fluid,
p81
aVwhich acts as a protective layer.
p82
aVAnd so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the skull.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe other problem with this video
p85
aVis that the brain is shown
p86
aVas a kind of rigid whole as it moves around,
p87
aVand that's not true either.
p88
aVYour brain is one of the softest substances in your body,
p89
aVand you can think of it kind of like jello.
p90
aVSo as your head is moving back and forth,
p91
aVyour brain is twisting and turning and contorting,
p92
aVand the tissue is getting stretched.
p93
aVAnd so most experts, I think, would agree
p94
aVthat concussion is not likely to be something that's happening
p95
aVon this outer surface of the brain,
p96
aVbut rather it's something that's much deeper
p97
aVtowards the center of the brain.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow, the way that we're approaching this problem
p100
aVto try to understand the mechanisms of concussion
p101
aVand to figure out if we can prevent it
p102
aVis we are using a device like this.
p103
aVIt's a mouthguard.
p104
aVIt has sensors in it that are essentially the same
p105
aVthat are in your cell phone:
p106
aVaccelerometers, gyroscopes,
p107
aVand when someone is struck in the head,
p108
aVit can tell you how their head moved
p109
aVat a thousand samples per second.
p110
aVThe principle behind the mouthguard is this:
p111
aVit fits onto your teeth.
p112
aVYour teeth are one of the hardest substances in your body.
p113
aVSo it rigidly couples to your skull
p114
aVand gives you the most precise possible measurement
p115
aVof how the skull moves.
p116
aVPeople have tried other approaches, with helmets.
p117
aVWe've looked at other sensors that go on your skin,
p118
aVand they all simply move around too much,
p119
aVand so we found that this is the only reliable way
p120
aVto take a good measurement.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo now that we've got this device, we can go beyond studying cadavers,
p123
aVbecause you can only learn so much about concussion
p124
aVfrom studying a cadaver,
p125
aVand we want to learn and study live humans.
p126
aVSo where can we find a group of willing volunteers
p127
aVto go out and smash their heads into each other on a regular basis
p128
aVand sustain concussion?
p129
aVWell, I was one of them,
p130
aVand it's your local friendly Stanford football team.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo this is our laboratory,
p133
aVand I want to show you
p134
aVthe first concussion we measured with this device.
p135
aVOne of the things that I should point out is the device has this gyroscope in it,
p136
aVand that allows you to measure the rotation of the head.
p137
aVMost experts think that that's the critical factor
p138
aVthat might start to tell us what is happening in concussion.
p139
aVSo please watch this video.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnnouncer: Cougars bring extra people late, but Luck has time,
p142
aVand Winslow is crushed.
p143
aVI hope he's all right.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Audience roars)
p146
aa(lp147
VTop of your screen,
p148
aVyou'll see him come on just this little post route,
p149
aVget separation, safety.
p150
aVHere it comes at you in real speed. You'll hear this.
p151
aVThe hit delivered by \u2014
p152
aa(lp153
VDavid Camarillo: Sorry, three times is probably a little excessive there.
p154
aVBut you get the idea.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo when you look at just the film here,
p157
aVpretty much the only thing you can see is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.
p158
aVBut when we extract the data
p159
aVout of the mouthguard that he was wearing,
p160
aVwe can see much more detail, much richer information.
p161
aVAnd one of the things that we noticed here
p162
aVis that he was struck in the lower left side of his face mask.
p163
aVAnd so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive.
p164
aVHis head did not move to the right.
p165
aVIn fact, it rotated first to the left.
p166
aVThen as the neck began to compress,
p167
aVthe force of the blow caused it to whip back to the right.
p168
aVSo this left-right motion was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,
p169
aVand we think that is probably what led to the brain injury.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion,
p172
aVbut what we really want to know is what's happening inside of the brain.
p173
aVSo we collaborate with Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.
p174
aVThey've developed a finite element model of the brain.
p175
aVAnd so this is a simulation
p176
aVusing the data from our mouthguard from the injury I just showed you,
p177
aVand what you see is the brain \u2014
p178
aVthis is a cross-section right in the front
p179
aVof the brain twisting and contorting as I mentioned.
p180
aVSo you can see this doesn't look a lot like the CDC video.
p181
aVNow, the colors that you're looking at
p182
aVare how much the brain tissue is being stretched.
p183
aVAnd so the red is 50 percent.
p184
aVThat means the brain has been stretched to 50 percent of its original length,
p185
aVthe tissue in that particular area.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd the main thing I want to draw your attention to is this red spot.
p188
aVSo the red spot is very close to the center of the brain,
p189
aVand relatively speaking,
p190
aVyou don't see a lot of colors like that on the exterior surface
p191
aVas the CDC video showed.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, to explain a little more detail
p194
aVabout how we think concussion might be happening,
p195
aVone thing I should mention
p196
aVis that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely
p197
aVwhen you're struck and your head rotates in this direction.
p198
aVThis is more common in sports like football,
p199
aVbut this seems to be more dangerous. So what might be happening there?
p200
aVWell, one thing that you'll notice in the human brain
p201
aVthat is different than other animals
p202
aVis we have these two very large lobes.
p203
aVWe have the right brain and the left brain.
p204
aVAnd the key thing to notice in this figure here
p205
aVis that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain
p206
aVthere's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain.
p207
aVAnd in that fissure, what you can't see in this image,
p208
aVyou'll have to trust me,
p209
aVthere is a fibrous sheet of tissue.
p210
aVIt's called the falx,
p211
aVand it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head,
p212
aVand it's quite stiff.
p213
aVAnd so what that allows for is when you're struck
p214
aVand your head rotates in this left-right direction,
p215
aVforces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, what's there at the bottom of this fissure?
p218
aVIt's the wiring of your brain,
p219
aVand in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure
p220
aVis the single largest fiber bundle
p221
aVthat is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain.
p222
aVIt's called the corpus callosum.
p223
aVAnd we think that this might be
p224
aVone of the most common mechanisms of concussion,
p225
aVand as the forces move down, they strike the corpus callosum,
p226
aVit causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain
p227
aVand could explain some of the symptoms of concussion.
p228
aa(lp229
VThis finding is also consistent of what we've seen
p230
aVin this brain disease that I mentioned, chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
p231
aVSo this is an image of a middle-aged ex-professional football player,
p232
aVand the thing that I want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum,
p233
aVand I'll page back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum
p234
aVand the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,
p235
aVit is greatly atrophied.
p236
aVAnd the same goes for all of the space in the ventricles.
p237
aVThese ventricles are much larger.
p238
aVAnd so all of this tissue near the center of the brain
p239
aVhas died off over time.
p240
aVSo what we're learning is indeed consistent.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, there is some good news here,
p243
aVand I hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk.
p244
aVOne of the things that we've noticed,
p245
aVspecifically about this mechanism of injury,
p246
aVis although there's a rapid transmission of the forces down this fissure,
p247
aVit still takes a defined amount of time.
p248
aVAnd what we think is that if we can slow the head down just enough
p249
aVso that the brain does not lag behind the skull
p250
aVbut instead it moves in synchrony with the skull,
p251
aVthen we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo how can we slow the head down?
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VA gigantic helmet.
p258
aVSo with more space, you have more time,
p259
aVand this is a bit of a joke, but some of you may have seen this.
p260
aVThis is bubble soccer, and it's a real sport.
p261
aVIn fact, I saw some young adults
p262
aVplaying this sport down the street from my house the other day,
p263
aVand as far as I know there have been no reported concussions.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VBut in all seriousness, this principle does work,
p268
aVbut this has gone too far.
p269
aVThis isn't something that's practical for bike riding or playing football.
p270
aVAnd so we are collaborating with a company in Sweden called Hövding.
p271
aVSome of you may have seen their work,
p272
aVand they're using the same principle of air to give you some extra space
p273
aVto prevent concussion.
p274
aVKids, don't try this at home please.
p275
aVThis stuntman does not have a helmet.
p276
aVHe instead has a neck collar,
p277
aVand this neck collar has sensors in it,
p278
aVthe same type of sensors that are in our mouthguard,
p279
aVand it detects when he's likely to have a fall,
p280
aVand there's an airbag that explodes and triggers,
p281
aVthe same way that an airbag works in your car, essentially.
p282
aVAnd in the experiments we've done in my lab with their device,
p283
aVwe found that it can greatly reduce the risk of concussion in some scenarios
p284
aVcompared to a normal bicycle helmet.
p285
aVSo it's a pretty exciting development.
p286
aa(lp287
VBut in order for us to actually realize the benefits of technology
p288
aVthat can prevent concussion,
p289
aVit needs to meet regulations.
p290
aVThat's a reality.
p291
aVAnd this device is for sale in Europe
p292
aVbut is not for sale in the US, and probably won't be any time soon.
p293
aVSo I wanted to tell you why.
p294
aVThere are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons.
p295
aa(lp296
VBike helmets are federally regulated.
p297
aVThe Consumer Product Safety Commission has been given jurisdiction
p298
aVto approve any bike helmet for sale,
p299
aVand this is the test they use.
p300
aVThis is back to what I was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture.
p301
aVThat's what this test is for.
p302
aVAnd that's an important thing to do.
p303
aVIt can save your life, but it's not sufficient, I would say.
p304
aVSo for example, one thing this test doesn't evaluate
p305
aVis it doesn't tell you is that airbag going to trigger
p306
aVat the right time and place, and not trigger when it doesn't need to?
p307
aVSimilarly, it's not going to tell you
p308
aVis this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not?
p309
aVAnd if you look at football helmets, which aren't regulated,
p310
aVthey still have a very similar test.
p311
aVThey're not regulated by the government, anyway.
p312
aVThey have an industry body, which is the way most industries work.
p313
aVBut this industry body, I can tell you, has been quite resistant
p314
aVto updating their standards.
p315
aVSo in my lab, we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion,
p316
aVbut we want to understand how can we have better test standards?
p317
aVAnd we hope that the government can use this type of information
p318
aVto encourage innovation
p319
aVby letting consumers know
p320
aVhow protected are you with a given helmet.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd I want to bring this back finally to the original question I asked,
p323
aVwhich is, would I feel comfortable letting my child play football
p324
aVor ride a bicycle?
p325
aVAnd this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience.
p326
aVI'm much more nervous about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.
p327
aVSo she's a year and a half old,
p328
aVand she's already, well, wants to anyway, race down the streets of San Francisco.
p329
aVThis is the bottom of one of these streets.
p330
aVAnd so my personal goal is to \u2014 and I believe this is possible \u2014
p331
aVis to further develop these technologies,
p332
aVand in fact, we're working on something in my lab in particular
p333
aVthat really makes optimal use of the given space of a helmet.
p334
aVAnd I am confident that we will be able to,
p335
aVbefore she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,
p336
aVhave something available
p337
aVthat can in fact really reduce the risk of concussion
p338
aVand comply with regulatory bodies.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd so what I'd like to do \u2014
p341
aVand I know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature,
p342
aVI've got a couple years here \u2014
p343
aVis to be able to tell parents and grandparents when I'm asked,
p344
aVit is safe and healthy for your children to engage in these activities.
p345
aVAnd I'm very fortunate to have a wonderful team at Stanford
p346
aVthat's working hard on this.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo I hope to come back in a few years with the final story,
p349
aVbut for now I will tell you,
p350
aVplease don't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion.
p351
aVThere is hope.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
