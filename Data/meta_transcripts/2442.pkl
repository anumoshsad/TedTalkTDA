VWhat do you think when you look at me?
p4
aVA woman of faith? An expert?
p5
aVMaybe even a sister.
p6
aVOr oppressed,
p7
aVbrainwashed,
p8
aVa terrorist.
p9
aVOr just an airport security line delay.
p10
aVThat one's actually true.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VIf some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.
p15
aVThat's just how the media has been portraying
p16
aVpeople who look like me.
p17
aVOne study found
p18
aVthat 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.
p19
aVAnd studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.
p20
aVI guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VWell, for those of you who have never met a Muslim,
p25
aVit's great to meet you.
p26
aVLet me tell you who I am.
p27
aVI'm a mom, a coffee lover \u2014
p28
aVdouble espresso, cream on the side.
p29
aVI'm an introvert.
p30
aVI'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.
p31
aVAnd I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
p32
aVBut not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.
p33
aVIt was a choice.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen I was 17, I decided to come out.
p36
aVNo, not as a gay person like some of my friends,
p37
aVbut as a Muslim,
p38
aVand decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.
p39
aVMy feminist friends were aghast:
p40
aV"Why are you oppressing yourself?"
p41
aVThe funny thing was,
p42
aVit was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence
p43
aVfrom the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,
p44
aVto conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.
p45
aVI didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.
p46
aVI wrestled with the Quran.
p47
aVI read and reflected and questioned and doubted
p48
aVand, ultimately, believed.
p49
aVMy relationship with God \u2014 it was not love at first sight.
p50
aVIt was a trust and a slow surrender
p51
aVthat deepened with every reading of the Quran.
p52
aVIts rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.
p53
aVI see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
p54
aVHave you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you
p55
aVand yet loves you anyway?
p56
aVThat's how it feels.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so later, I got married,
p59
aVand like all good Egyptians,
p60
aVstarted my career as an engineer.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VI later had a child, after getting married,
p65
aVand I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd then that terrible morning of September, 2001.
p68
aVI think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.
p69
aVI was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast,
p70
aVand I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."
p71
aVThere was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings,
p72
aVpeople jumping out of buildings.
p73
aVWhat was this?
p74
aVAn accident?
p75
aVA malfunction?
p76
aVMy shock quickly turned to outrage.
p77
aVWho would do this?
p78
aVAnd I switch the channel and I hear,
p79
aa(lp80
V"... Muslim terrorist ...,"
p81
aV"... in the name of Islam ...,"
p82
aV"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"
p83
aV"... jihad ...,"
p84
aV"... we should bomb Mecca."
p85
aVOh my God.
p86
aa(lp87
VNot only had my country been attacked,
p88
aVbut in a flash,
p89
aVsomebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen
p90
aVto a suspect.
p91
aa(lp92
VThat same day, we had to drive across Middle America
p93
aVto move to a new city to start grad school.
p94
aVAnd I remember sitting in the passenger seat
p95
aVas we drove in silence,
p96
aVcrouched as low as I could go in my seat,
p97
aVfor the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
p98
aa(lp99
VWe moved into our apartment that night in a new town
p100
aVin what felt like a completely different world.
p101
aVAnd then I was hearing and seeing and reading
p102
aVwarnings from national Muslim organizations
p103
aVsaying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware,"
p104
aV"Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."
p105
aa(lp106
VI stayed inside all week.
p107
aVAnd then it was Friday that same week,
p108
aVthe day that Muslims congregate for worship.
p109
aVAnd again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday,
p110
aVit could be a target."
p111
aVAnd I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.
p112
aVEmotions were so raw, understandably,
p113
aVand I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims,
p114
aVor people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out
p115
aVand beaten in the street.
p116
aVMosques were actually firebombed.
p117
aVAnd I thought, we should just stay home.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd yet, something didn't feel right.
p120
aVBecause those people who attacked our country
p121
aVattacked our country.
p122
aVI get it that people were angry at the terrorists.
p123
aVGuess what? So was I.
p124
aVAnd so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.
p125
aVI don't mind questions. I love questions.
p126
aVIt's the accusations that are tough.
p127
aa(lp128
VToday we hear people actually saying things like,
p129
aV"There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.
p130
aVWhen are we going to get rid of them?"
p131
aVSo, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.
p132
aVThey talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor
p133
aVin the body of America.
p134
aVAnd the only question is, are we malignant or benign?
p135
aVYou know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether,
p136
aVand a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.
p139
aVMuslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America,
p140
aVwe're a vital organ.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VMuslims are inventors and teachers,
p149
aVfirst responders and Olympic athletes.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?
p152
aVIt might free up some parking spots,
p153
aVbut it will not end terrorism.
p154
aVGoing to a mosque regularly is actually linked
p155
aVto having more tolerant views of people of other faiths
p156
aVand greater civic engagement.
p157
aVAnd as one police chief in the Washington, DC area
p158
aVrecently told me,
p159
aVpeople don't actually get radicalized at mosques.
p160
aVThey get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.
p161
aVAnd what you find about the radicalization process
p162
aVis it starts online,
p163
aVbut the first thing that happens
p164
aVis the person gets cut off from their community,
p165
aVfrom even their family,
p166
aVso that the extremist group can brainwash them
p167
aVinto believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims,
p168
aVand everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology
p169
aVare sellouts or apostates.
p170
aVSo if we want to prevent radicalization,
p171
aVwe have to keep people going to the mosque.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.
p174
aVAfter all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.
p175
aVNow, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being,
p176
aVI think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
p177
aVBut we would be giving in to their narrative
p178
aVif we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VThank you.
p183
aa(lp184
VISIS has as much to do with Islam
p185
aVas the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VBoth groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.
p190
aVBut when you look at them, they're not motivated
p191
aVby what they read in their holy book.
p192
aVIt's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.
p193
aa(lp194
VRecently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.
p195
aVHe said that a girl came to him
p196
aVbecause she was thinking of going to join ISIS.
p197
aVAnd I was really surprised and asked him,
p198
aVhad she been in contact with a radical religious leader?
p199
aVAnd he said the problem was quite the opposite,
p200
aVthat every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down
p201
aVand said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world,
p202
aVwas just going to get her in trouble.
p203
aVAnd so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger,
p204
aVshe was a prime target to be exploited
p205
aVby extremists promising her a solution.
p206
aVWhat this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.
p207
aVHe didn't shame her for her rage \u2014 instead, he gave her constructive ways
p208
aVto make real change in the world.
p209
aVWhat she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.
p210
aa(lp211
VI've told you a little bit
p212
aVabout how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
p213
aVBut how does it impact ordinary Americans?
p214
aVHow does it impact everyone else?
p215
aVHow does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy,
p216
aVthe health of our free thought?
p217
aa(lp218
VWell, one study \u2014 actually, several studies in neuroscience \u2014
p219
aVshow that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.
p220
aVWe become more accepting of authoritarianism,
p221
aVconformity and prejudice.
p222
aVOne study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories
p223
aVthat were negative about Muslims,
p224
aVthey became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries
p225
aVand policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, this isn't just academic.
p228
aVWhen you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked
p229
aVbetween 2001 and 2013,
p230
aVit happened three times,
p231
aVbut it wasn't around terrorist attacks.
p232
aVIt was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.
p233
aVSo Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism
p234
aVas I would have expected.
p235
aVIt can actually be a tool of public manipulation,
p236
aVeroding the very foundation of a free society,
p237
aVwhich is rational and well-informed citizens.
p238
aVMuslims are like canaries in the coal mine.
p239
aVWe might be the first to feel it,
p240
aVbut the toxic air of fear is harming us all.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd assigning collective guilt
p245
aVisn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.
p246
aVDeah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple
p247
aVliving in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
p248
aVwhere they both went to school.
p249
aVDeah was an athlete.
p250
aVHe was in dental school, talented, promising ...
p251
aVAnd his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest,
p252
aVmost generous human being she knew.
p253
aVShe was visiting him there and he showed her his resume,
p254
aVand she was amazed.
p255
aVShe said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"
p256
aVJust a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife,
p257
aVtheir neighbor,
p258
aVCraig Stephen Hicks,
p259
aVmurdered them,
p260
aVas well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon,
p261
aVin their apartment,
p262
aVexecution style,
p263
aVafter posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.
p264
aVHe shot Deah eight times.
p265
aVSo bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, back to my story.
p268
aVWhat happened after 9/11?
p269
aVDid we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?
p270
aVWell, we talked it over,
p271
aVand it might seem like a small decision, but to us,
p272
aVit was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids:
p273
aVone that would control us by fear
p274
aVor one where we were practicing our religion freely.
p275
aVSo we decided to go to the mosque.
p276
aVAnd we put my son in his car seat,
p277
aVbuckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.
p278
aVI took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall
p279
aVand what I saw made me stop.
p280
aVThe place was completely full.
p281
aVAnd then the imam made an announcement,
p282
aVthanking and welcoming our guests,
p283
aVbecause half the congregation
p284
aVwere Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists,
p285
aVpeople of faith and no faith,
p286
aVwho had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Applause)
p289
aa(lp290
VI just break down at this time.
p291
aVThese people were there because they chose courage and compassion
p292
aVover panic and prejudice.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhat will you choose?
p295
aVWhat will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?
p296
aVWill you play it safe?
p297
aVOr will you join those who say
p298
aVwe are better than that?
p299
aa(lp300
VThank you.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you so much.
p305
aa(lp306
VHelen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
p307
aVBut I wonder,
p308
aVwhat would you say to those who might argue
p309
aVthat you're giving a TED Talk,
p310
aVyou're clearly a deep thinker,
p311
aVyou work at a fancy think tank,
p312
aVyou're an exception, you're not the rule.
p313
aVWhat would you say to those people?
p314
aa(lp315
VDalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you,
p316
aVI'm completely ordinary.
p317
aVI'm not an exception.
p318
aVMy story is not unusual.
p319
aVI am as ordinary as they come.
p320
aVWhen you look at Muslims around the world \u2014
p321
aVand I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done
p322
aVon Muslims around the world \u2014
p323
aVpeople want ordinary things.
p324
aVThey want prosperity for their family,
p325
aVthey want jobs
p326
aVand they want to live in peace.
p327
aVSo I am not in any way an exception.
p328
aVWhen you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule,
p329
aVoftentimes it's that the rule is broken,
p330
aVnot that they're an exception to it.
p331
