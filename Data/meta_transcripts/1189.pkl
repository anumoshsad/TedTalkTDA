VHave you ever wondered
p4
aVwhy extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries
p5
aVover the course of the last decade?
p6
aVHave you ever wondered
p7
aVhow such a situation can be turned around?
p8
aVHave you ever looked at the Arab uprisings
p9
aVand thought, "How could we have predicted that?"
p10
aVor "How could we have better prepared for that?"
p11
aVWell my personal story, my personal journey,
p12
aVwhat brings me to the TED stage here today,
p13
aVis a demonstration of exactly what's been happening
p14
aVin Muslim-majority countries
p15
aVover the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.
p16
aVI want to share some of that story with you,
p17
aVbut also some of my ideas around change
p18
aVand the role of social movements in creating change
p19
aVin Muslim-majority societies.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo let me begin
p22
aVby first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,
p23
aVif I may indulge.
p24
aVIn medieval societies there were defined allegiances.
p25
aVAn identity was defined
p26
aVprimarily by religion.
p27
aVAnd then we moved on into an era in the 19th century
p28
aVwith the rise of a European nation-state
p29
aVwhere identities and allegiances were defined
p30
aVby ethnicity.
p31
aVSo identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,
p32
aVand the nation-state reflected that.
p33
aVIn the age of globalization, we moved on.
p34
aVI call it the era of citizenship \u2014
p35
aVwhere people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,
p36
aVbut all be equal as citizens
p37
aVin a state.
p38
aVYou could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;
p39
aVyou could be British-Pakistani.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut I believe now
p42
aVthat we're moving into a new age,
p43
aVand that age The New York Times dubbed recently
p44
aVas "the age of behavior."
p45
aVHow I define the age of behavior
p46
aVis a period of transnational allegiances,
p47
aVwhere identity is defined more so
p48
aVby ideas and narratives.
p49
aVAnd these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders
p50
aVare increasingly beginning to affect
p51
aVthe way in which people behave.
p52
aVNow this is not all necessarily good news,
p53
aVbecause it's also my belief
p54
aVthat hatred has gone global
p55
aVjust as much as love.
p56
aVBut actually it's my belief
p57
aVthat the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,
p58
aVup until now, up until recent times,
p59
aVup until the last six months,
p60
aVthe people who have been capitalizing most
p61
aVon the age of behavior
p62
aVand the transnational allegiances,
p63
aVusing digital activism
p64
aVand other sorts of borderless technologies,
p65
aVthose who've been benefiting from this
p66
aVhave been extremists.
p67
aVAnd that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.
p68
aa(lp69
VIf we look at Islamists,
p70
aVif we look at the phenomenon
p71
aVof far-right fascists,
p72
aVone thing they've been very good at,
p73
aVone thing that they've actually been exceeding in,
p74
aVis communicating across borders,
p75
aVusing technologies to organize themselves,
p76
aVto propagate their message
p77
aVand to create truly global phenomena.
p78
aVNow I should know,
p79
aVbecause for 13 years of my life,
p80
aVI was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.
p81
aVAnd I was actually a potent force
p82
aVin spreading ideas across borders,
p83
aVand I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism
p84
aVas distinct from Islam the faith,
p85
aVand the way in which it influenced my co-religionists
p86
aVacross the world.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd my story, my personal story,
p89
aVis truly evidence for the age of behavior
p90
aVthat I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.
p91
aVI was, by the way \u2014 I'm an Essex lad,
p92
aVborn and raised in Essex in the U.K.
p93
aVAnyone who's from England
p94
aVknows the reputation we have from Essex.
p95
aVBut having been born in Essex,
p96
aVat the age of 16,
p97
aVI joined an organization.
p98
aVAt the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University
p99
aVto this organization.
p100
aVAt the age of 19,
p101
aVI was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.
p102
aVAt the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.
p103
aVAt the age of 22,
p104
aVI was co-founding this organization in Denmark.
p105
aVBy the age of 24,
p106
aVI found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,
p107
aVbeing blacklisted from three countries in the world
p108
aVfor attempting to overthrow their governments,
p109
aVbeing subjected to torture
p110
aVin Egyptian jails
p111
aVand sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow that journey,
p114
aVand what took me from Essex all the way across the world \u2014
p115
aVby the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.
p116
aVWe felt they were from the age of yesteryear.
p117
aVWe felt that they were out of date.
p118
aVI learned how to use email
p119
aVfrom the extremist organization that I used.
p120
aVI learned how to effectively communicate across borders
p121
aVwithout being detected.
p122
aVEventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.
p123
aVBut the way in which I learned
p124
aVto use technology to my advantage
p125
aVwas because I was within an extremist organization
p126
aVthat was forced to think beyond
p127
aVthe confines of the nation-state.
p128
aVThe age of behavior: where ideas and narratives
p129
aVwere increasingly defining behavior
p130
aVand identity and allegiances.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo as I said, we looked to the status quo
p133
aVand ridiculed it.
p134
aVAnd it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.
p135
aVBut even if you look across
p136
aVthe mood music in Europe of late,
p137
aVfar-right fascism is also on the rise.
p138
aVA form of anti-Islam rhetoric
p139
aVis also on the rise
p140
aVand it's transnational.
p141
aVAnd the consequences that this is having
p142
aVis that it's affecting the political climate
p143
aVacross Europe.
p144
aVWhat's actually happening
p145
aVis that what were previously localized parochialisms,
p146
aVindividual or groupings of extremists
p147
aVwho were isolated from one another,
p148
aVhave become interconnected in a globalized way
p149
aVand have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.
p150
aVBecause the Internet and connection technologies
p151
aVare connecting them across the world.
p152
aa(lp153
VIf you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,
p154
aVyou will see some things that are happening
p155
aVthat are influencing domestic politics,
p156
aVyet the phenomenon is transnational.
p157
aVIn certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.
p158
aVIn others, headscarves are being banned.
p159
aVIn others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,
p160
aVas we speak.
p161
aVAnd on the flip side,
p162
aVwe have transnational Islamist extremists
p163
aVdoing the same thing across their own societies.
p164
aVAnd so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected
p165
aVin a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.
p166
aVNow that never would have been possible before.
p167
aVThey would have felt isolated,
p168
aVuntil these sorts of technologies came around
p169
aVand connected them in a way
p170
aVthat made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhere does that leave democracy aspirants?
p173
aVWell I believe they're getting left far behind.
p174
aVAnd I'll give you an example here at this stage.
p175
aVIf any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:
p176
aVthere's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.
p177
aVAs an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,
p178
aVin hiding currently in Yemen,
p179
aVwho inspired a Nigerian,
p180
aVson of the head of Nigeria's national bank.
p181
aVThis Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,
p182
aVboarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.
p183
aVIn the meanwhile,
p184
aVthe Old mentality with a capital O,
p185
aVwas represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,
p186
aVwarning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,
p187
aVand this warning fell on deaf ears.
p188
aVThe Old mentality with a capital O,
p189
aVas represented by the nation-state,
p190
aVnot yet fully into the age of behavior,
p191
aVnot recognizing the power of transnational social movements,
p192
aVgot left behind.
p193
aVAnd the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded
p194
aVin attacking the United States of America.
p195
aVAgain with the example of the far right:
p196
aVthat we find, ironically,
p197
aVxenophobic nationalists
p198
aVare utilizing the benefits of globalization.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo why are they succeeding?
p201
aVAnd why are democracy aspirants falling behind?
p202
aVWell we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.
p203
aVAnd a social movement is comprised, in my view,
p204
aVit's comprised of four main characteristics.
p205
aVIt's comprised of ideas and narratives
p206
aVand symbols and leaders.
p207
aVI'll talk you through one example,
p208
aVand that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,
p209
aVand that's the example of Al-Qaeda.
p210
aVIf I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,
p211
aVthat's something that comes to your mind immediately.
p212
aVIf I ask you to think of their narratives \u2014
p213
aVthe West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West \u2014
p214
aVthese narratives, they come to your mind immediately.
p215
aVIncidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:
p216
aVthe idea is the cause that one believes in;
p217
aVand the narrative is the way to sell that cause \u2014
p218
aVthe propaganda, if you like, of the cause.
p219
aVSo the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately.
p220
aa(lp221
VIf I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,
p222
aVthey come to your mind immediately.
p223
aVOne of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.
p224
aVSo these symbols and these leaders
p225
aVcome to your mind immediately.
p226
aVAnd that's the power of social movements.
p227
aVThey're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives
p228
aVand these symbols and these leaders.
p229
aVHowever,
p230
aVif I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,
p231
aVand I ask you to think
p232
aVof the symbols and the leaders for democracy
p233
aVin Pakistan today,
p234
aVyou'll be hard pressed
p235
aVto think beyond perhaps
p236
aVthe assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
p237
aVWhich means, by definition,
p238
aVthat particular leader no longer exists.
p239
aa(lp240
VOne of the problems we're facing is, in my view,
p241
aVthat there are no globalized,
p242
aVyouth-led, grassroots social movements
p243
aVadvocating for democratic culture
p244
aVacross Muslim-majority societies.
p245
aVThere is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,
p246
aVfor democracy across Muslim-majority societies.
p247
aVThere are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols
p248
aVadvocating the democratic culture on the ground.
p249
aVSo that begs the next question.
p250
aVWhy is it that extremist organizations,
p251
aVwhether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism \u2014
p252
aVIslamism meaning those who wish to impose
p253
aVone version of Islam over the rest of society \u2014
p254
aVwhy is it that they are succeeding
p255
aVin organizing in a globalized way,
p256
aVwhereas those who aspire to democratic culture
p257
aVare falling behind?
p258
aVAnd I believe that's for four reasons.
p259
aVI believe, number one, it's complacency.
p260
aVBecause those who aspire to democratic culture
p261
aVare in power,
p262
aVor have societies
p263
aVthat are leading globalized, powerful societies,
p264
aVpowerful countries.
p265
aVAnd that level of complacency means
p266
aVthey don't feel the need to advocate for that culture.
p267
aa(lp268
VThe second, I believe,
p269
aVis political correctness.
p270
aVThat we have a hesitation
p271
aVin espousing the universality of democratic culture
p272
aVbecause we are associating that \u2014
p273
aVwe associate believing in the universality of our values \u2014
p274
aVwith extremists.
p275
aVYet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,
p276
aVwe do say that human rights are universal.
p277
aVBut actually going out to propagate that view
p278
aVis associated with either neoconservativism
p279
aVor with Islamist extremism.
p280
aVTo go around saying that I believe
p281
aVdemocratic culture is the best that we've arrived at
p282
aVas a form of political organizing
p283
aVis associated with extremism.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd the third,
p286
aVdemocratic choice in Muslim-majority societies
p287
aVhas been relegated to a political choice,
p288
aVmeaning political parties
p289
aVin many of these societies
p290
aVask people to vote for them
p291
aVas the democratic party,
p292
aVbut then the other parties ask them to vote for them
p293
aVas the military party \u2014
p294
aVwanting to rule by military dictatorship.
p295
aVAnd then you have a third party saying,
p296
aV"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy."
p297
aVSo democracy has become merely one political choice
p298
aVamong many other forms
p299
aVof political choices available in those societies.
p300
aVAnd what happens as a result of this
p301
aVis, when those parties are elected,
p302
aVand inevitably they fail,
p303
aVor inevitably they make political mistakes,
p304
aVdemocracy takes the blame
p305
aVfor their political mistakes.
p306
aVAnd then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.
p307
aVLet's bring the military back again."
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd the fourth reason, I believe,
p310
aVis what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.
p311
aVWhat I mean by that is,
p312
aVif the world superpower today was a communist,
p313
aVit would be much easier for democracy activists
p314
aVto use democracy activism
p315
aVas a form of resistance against colonialism,
p316
aVthan it is today with the world superpower being America,
p317
aVoccupying certain lands
p318
aVand also espousing democratic ideals.
p319
aVSo roughly these four reasons
p320
aVmake it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread
p321
aVas a civilizational choice,
p322
aVnot merely as a political choice.
p323
aa(lp324
VWhen talking about those reasons,
p325
aVlet's break down certain preconceptions.
p326
aVIs it just about grievances?
p327
aVIs it just about a lack of education?
p328
aVWell statistically,
p329
aVthe majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.
p330
aVStatistically, they are educated, on average,
p331
aVabove the education levels
p332
aVof Western society.
p333
aVAnecdotally, we can demonstrate
p334
aVthat if poverty was the only factor,
p335
aVwell Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.
p336
aVHis deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician \u2014
p337
aVnot an ill-educated man.
p338
aVInternational aid and development has been going on for years,
p339
aVbut extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,
p340
aVhas been on the rise.
p341
aVAnd what I believe is missing
p342
aVis genuine grassroots activism
p343
aVon the ground,
p344
aVin addition to international aid,
p345
aVin addition to education, in addition to health.
p346
aVNot exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,
p347
aVis propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd this is where I believe
p350
aVneoconservatism had it upside-down.
p351
aVNeoconservatism had the philosophy
p352
aVthat you go in with a supply-led approach
p353
aVto impose democratic values from the top down.
p354
aVWhereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,
p355
aVhave been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.
p356
aVThey've been building civilizational demand for their values
p357
aVon the grassroots,
p358
aVand we've been seeing those societies slowly transition
p359
aVto societies that are increasingly asking for
p360
aVa form of Islamism.
p361
aVMass movements in Pakistan
p362
aVhave been represented after the Arab uprisings
p363
aVmainly by organizations
p364
aVclaiming for some form of theocracy,
p365
aVrather than for a democratic uprising.
p366
aVBecause since pre-partition,
p367
aVthey've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.
p368
aVAnd what's needed is a genuine transnational
p369
aVyouth-led movement
p370
aVthat works to actively advocate
p371
aVfor the democratic culture \u2014
p372
aVwhich is necessarily more
p373
aVthan just elections.
p374
aVBut without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.
p375
aVWithout human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.
p376
aVWithout freedom of belief,
p377
aVyou don't have the right to join organizations.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo what's needed is those organizations on the ground
p380
aVadvocating for the democratic culture itself
p381
aVto create the demand on the ground for this culture.
p382
aVWhat that will do
p383
aVis avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,
p384
aVwhere currently we have political parties presenting democracy
p385
aVas merely a political choice in those societies
p386
aValongside other choices
p387
aVsuch as military rule and theocracy.
p388
aVWhereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,
p389
aVrather than merely on a political level,
p390
aVa level above politics \u2014
p391
aVmovements that are not political parties,
p392
aVbut are rather creating this civilizational demand
p393
aVfor this democratic culture.
p394
aVWhat we'll have in the end
p395
aVis this ideal that you see on the slide here \u2014
p396
aVthe ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,
p397
aVnot for a democracy.
p398
aVBut to get to that stage,
p399
aVwhere democracy builds the fabric of society
p400
aVand the political choices within that fabric,
p401
aVbut are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship \u2014
p402
aVi.e. you're voting in a democracy,
p403
aVin an existing democracy,
p404
aVand that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.
p405
aVTo get to that stage,
p406
aVwe genuinely need to start building demand
p407
aVin those societies on the ground.
p408
aa(lp409
VNow to conclude, how does that happen?
p410
aVWell, Egypt is a good starting point.
p411
aVThe Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.
p412
aVBut what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt
p413
aVwas particularly cathartic for me.
p414
aVWhat happened there was a political coalition
p415
aVgathered together for a political goal,
p416
aVand that was to remove the leader.
p417
aVWe need to move one step beyond that now.
p418
aVWe need to see how we can help those societies
p419
aVmove from political coalitions,
p420
aVloosely based political coalitions,
p421
aVto civilizational coalitions
p422
aVthat are working for the ideals and narratives
p423
aVof the democratic culture on the ground.
p424
aVBecause it's not enough to remove a leader
p425
aVor ruler or dictator.
p426
aVThat doesn't guarantee that what comes next
p427
aVwill be a society built on democratic values.
p428
aa(lp429
VBut generally, the trends that start in Egypt
p430
aVhave historically spread across the MENA region,
p431
aVthe Middle East and North Africa region.
p432
aVSo when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.
p433
aVIn the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,
p434
aVit spread across the MENA region as a whole.
p435
aa(lp436
VAnd the aspiration that we have at the moment \u2014
p437
aVas young Arabs are proving today
p438
aVand instantly rebranding themselves
p439
aVas being prepared to die for more than just terrorism \u2014
p440
aVis that there is a chance
p441
aVthat democratic culture can start in the region
p442
aVand spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.
p443
aVBut that will require
p444
aVhelping these societies transition
p445
aVfrom having merely political coalitions
p446
aVto building genuinely grassroots-based social movements
p447
aVthat advocate for the democratic culture.
p448
aVAnd we've made a start for that in Pakistan
p449
aVwith a movement called Khudi,
p450
aVwhere we are working on the ground to encourage the youth
p451
aVto create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.
p452
aVAnd it's with that thought that I'll end.
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd my time is up, and thank you for your time.
