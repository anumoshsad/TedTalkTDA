VWe're going to share a lot of secrets today, you and I,
p4
aVand in doing so, I hope that we can lift
p5
aVsome of the shame many of us feel about sex.
p6
aa(lp7
VHow many here have ever been catcalled by a stranger?
p8
aVLots of women.
p9
aVFor me, the time I remember best
p10
aVis when that stranger was a student of mine.
p11
aVHe came up to me after class that night
p12
aVand his words confirmed what I already knew:
p13
aa(lp14
V"I am so sorry, professor.
p15
aVIf I had known it was you, I would never have said those things."
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI wasn't a person to him until I was his professor.
p20
aVThis concept, called objectification,
p21
aVis the foundation of sexism,
p22
aVand we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives.
p23
aVWe see it in the government
p24
aVthat refuses to punish men
p25
aVfor raping women.
p26
aVWe see it in advertisements.
p27
aVHow many of you have seen an advertisement
p28
aVthat uses a woman's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product?
p29
aVOr movie after movie after movie
p30
aVthat portrays women as only love interests?
p31
aVThese examples might seem inconsequential and harmless,
p32
aVbut they're insidious,
p33
aVslowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people.
p34
aVWe see this in the school that sends home a 10-year-old girl
p35
aVbecause her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn,
p36
aVor the government that refuses to punish men for raping women
p37
aVover and over,
p38
aVor the woman who is killed
p39
aVbecause she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the dance floor.
p40
aa(lp41
VMedia plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women.
p42
aVLet's consider the classic romantic comedy.
p43
aVWe're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies,
p44
aVtwo kinds of desirable women, anyway.
p45
aVThe first is the sexy bombshell.
p46
aVThis is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body.
p47
aVOur leading man has no trouble identifying her
p48
aVand even less trouble having sex with her.
p49
aVThe second is our leading lady,
p50
aVthe beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with
p51
aVdespite not noticing her at first
p52
aVor not liking her if he did.
p53
aVThe first is the slut.
p54
aVShe is to be consumed and forgotten.
p55
aVShe is much too available.
p56
aVThe second is desirable but modest,
p57
aVand therefore worthy of our leading man's future babies.
p58
aVMarriage material.
p59
aVWe're actually told that women have two roles,
p60
aVbut these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman.
p61
aa(lp62
VOn the rare occasion that I share with a new acquaintance
p63
aVthat I study sex,
p64
aVif they don't end the conversation right then,
p65
aVthey're usually pretty intrigued.
p66
aa(lp67
V"Oh. Tell me more."
p68
aa(lp69
VSo I do.
p70
aa(lp71
V"I'm really interested in studying the sexual behaviors
p72
aVof pregnant and postpartum couples."
p73
aVAt this point I get a different kind of response.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
V"Oh. Huh.
p78
aVDo pregnant people even have sex?
p79
aVHave you thought about studying sexual desire
p80
aVor orgasms?
p81
aVThat would be interesting, and sexy."
p82
aa(lp83
VTell me. What are the first words that come to mind
p84
aVwhen you picture a pregnant woman?
p85
aVI asked this question in a survey of over 500 adults,
p86
aVand most responded with "belly" or "round"
p87
aVand "cute."
p88
aVThis didn't surprise me too much.
p89
aVWhat else do we label as cute?
p90
aVBabies. Puppies. Kittens.
p91
aVThe elderly. Right?
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VWhen we label an adult as cute, though,
p96
aVwe take away a lot of their intelligence,
p97
aVtheir complexity.
p98
aVWe reduce them to childlike qualities.
p99
aVI also asked heterosexual men
p100
aVto imagine a woman that they're partnered with is pregnant,
p101
aVand then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant,
p102
aVand then tell me the first words that come to mind
p103
aVwhen they imagine having sex.
p104
aVMost of the responses were negative.
p105
aV"Gross."
p106
aV"Awkward."
p107
aV"Not sexy." "Odd."
p108
aV"Uncomfortable."
p109
aV"How?"
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
V"Not worth the trouble." "Not worth the risk."
p114
aa(lp115
VThat last one really stuck with me.
p116
aVWe might think that because we divorce pregnant women and moms from sexuality,
p117
aVwe are removing the constraints of sexual objectification.
p118
aVThey experience less sexism. Right?
p119
aVNot exactly.
p120
aVWhat happens instead is a different kind of objectification.
p121
aVIn my efforts to explain this to others,
p122
aVone conversation led to the Venus of Willendorf,
p123
aVa Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty,
p124
aVhence the name Venus.
p125
aVThis theory was later revised, though,
p126
aVwhen scholars noted the sculptor's obvious focus
p127
aVon the figurine's reproductive features:
p128
aVlarge breasts, considered ideal for nursing;
p129
aVa round, possibly pregnant belly;
p130
aVthe remnants of red dye, alluding to menstruation or birth.
p131
aVThey also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down
p132
aVbecause her tiny feet don't allow her to be freestanding.
p133
aVShe also had no face.
p134
aVFor this reason, it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility
p135
aVand not a portrait of a person.
p136
aVShe was an object.
p137
aVIn the history of her interpretation,
p138
aVshe went from object of ideal beauty and love
p139
aVto object of reproduction.
p140
aa(lp141
VI think this transition speaks more
p142
aVabout the scholars who have interpreted her purpose
p143
aVthan the actual purpose of the figurine herself.
p144
aVWhen a woman becomes pregnant,
p145
aVshe leaves the realm of men's sexual desire
p146
aVand slides into her reproductive and child-rearing role.
p147
aVIn doing so, she also becomes
p148
aVthe property of the community,
p149
aVconsidered very important but only because she's pregnant. Right?
p150
aVI've taken to calling this the Willendorf effect,
p151
aVand once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life.
p152
aa(lp153
VHas anyone here ever been visibly pregnant?
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VYeah. Lots of you, right?
p158
aVSo how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during pregnancy,
p159
aVmaybe without even asking your permission first?
p160
aVOr told what you can and cannot eat
p161
aVby somebody who is not your doctor, your medical care provider?
p162
aVOr asked private questions about your birth plan?
p163
aVAnd then told why those choices are all wrong?
p164
aVYeah, me too.
p165
aVOr had a server refuse to bring you a glass of wine?
p166
aVThis one might give you pause, I know, but stay with me.
p167
aVThis is a huge secret.
p168
aVIt is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy.
p169
aVMany of us don't know this
p170
aVbecause doctors don't trust pregnant women with this secret \u2014
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
Vespecially if she's less educated or a woman of color.
p175
aa(lp176
VWhat this tells us is,
p177
aVthis Willendorf effect, it's also classist and racist.
p178
aVIt's present when the government reminds women
p179
aVwith every new anti-choice bill
p180
aVthat the contents of her uterus are not her own,
p181
aVor when an ob-gyn says,
p182
aV"While it's safe to have sex during pregnancy,
p183
aVsometimes you never know.
p184
aVBetter safe than sorry, right?"
p185
aVShe's denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy
p186
aVunder the guise of "be a good mother."
p187
aVWe don't trust her to make her own decisions.
p188
aVShe's cute, remember?
p189
aVWhen we tell women
p190
aVthat sexual pleasure \u2014 excuse me.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhen we tell women that sex isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,
p193
aVwhat we're telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.
p194
aVSo what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn't matter,
p195
aVeven though the needs of her fetus are not at odds with her own needs.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo medical providers,
p198
aVsuch as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
p199
aVhave the opportunity to educate about the safety of sex during pregnancy.
p200
aVSo what do the experts say?
p201
aVACOG actually has no public official statement
p202
aVabout the safety of sex during pregnancy.
p203
aVGuidance from the Mayo Clinic is generally positive
p204
aVbut presented with a caveat:
p205
aV"Although most women can safely have sex throughout pregnancy,
p206
aVsometimes it's best to be cautious."
p207
aa(lp208
VSome women don't want to have sex during pregnancy,
p209
aVand that's OK.
p210
aVSome women do want to have sex during pregnancy,
p211
aVand that's OK, too.
p212
aVWhat needs to stop is society telling women
p213
aVwhat they can and cannot do with their bodies.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
VPregnant women are not faceless, identity-less vessels of reproduction
p218
aVwho can't stand on their own two feet.
p219
aVBut the truth is, the real secret is,
p220
aVwe tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.
p221
aVWe refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women
p222
aVor women who don't want children even exist.
p223
aa(lp224
V"Oh, it's just a phase ...
p225
aa(lp226
Vshe just needs the right man to come along."
p227
aa(lp228
VEvery time a woman has sex
p229
aVsimply because it feels good,
p230
aVit is revolutionary.
p231
aVShe is revolutionary.
p232
aVShe is pushing back against society's insistence
p233
aVthat she exist simply for men's pleasure
p234
aVor for reproduction.
p235
aVA woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary,
p236
aVbecause a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VThat is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal.
p241
aVThat is a woman who insists
p242
aVthat you make room for her at the table of power,
p243
aVand that is the most terrifying of all
p244
aVbecause we can't make room for her
p245
aVwithout some of us giving up the extra space we hold.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aa(lp249
VI have one last secret for you.
p250
aVI am the mother of two boys
p251
aVand we could use your help.
p252
aVEven though my boys hear me say regularly
p253
aVthat it's important for men to recognize women as equals
p254
aVand they see their father modeling this,
p255
aVwe need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home.
p256
aVThis is not a men's problem or a women's problem.
p257
aVThis is everyone's problem,
p258
aVand we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality.
p259
aVFor starters, we have got to stop telling women
p260
aVwhat they can and cannot do with their bodies.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Applause)
p263
aa(lp264
VThis includes not treating pregnant women like community property.
p265
aVIf you don't know her, don't even ask to touch her belly.
p266
aVYou wouldn't anybody else.
p267
aVDon't tell her what she can and cannot eat.
p268
aVDon't ask her private details about her medical decisions.
p269
aVThis also includes understanding
p270
aVthat even if you are personally against abortion,
p271
aVyou can still fight for a woman's right to choose.
p272
aVWhen it comes to women's equality, the two need not oppose one another.
p273
aVIf you're somebody who has sex with women,
p274
aVprioritize her pleasure.
p275
aVIf you don't know how, ask.
p276
aVIf you have children \u2014
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
Vhave conversations about sex as early as possible,
p281
aVbecause kids don't look up s-e-x in the dictionary anymore.
p282
aVThey look it up on the internet.
p283
aVAnd when you're having those conversations about sex,
p284
aVdon't center them on reproduction only.
p285
aVPeople have sex for many reasons,
p286
aVsome because they want a baby,
p287
aVbut most of us have sex because it feels good.
p288
aVAdmit it.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd regardless of whether you have children or not,
p291
aVsupport comprehensive sex education that doesn't shame our teenagers.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VNothing positive comes from shaming teens
p296
aVfor their sexual desires, behaviors,
p297
aVother than positive STD and pregnancy tests.
p298
aa(lp299
VEvery single day, we are all given the opportunity
p300
aVto disrupt patterns of inequality.
p301
aVI think we can all agree that it's worth the trouble to do so.
p302
aa(lp303
VThank you.
