VThis is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the Earth.
p4
aVThis is a tapir.
p5
aVNow this, this is a baby tapir,
p6
aVthe cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBy far.
p11
aVThere is no competition here.
p12
aa(lp13
VI have dedicated the past 20 years of my life
p14
aVto the research and conservation of tapirs in Brazil,
p15
aVand it has been absolutely amazing.
p16
aVBut at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard
p17
aVabout the impact of my work.
p18
aVI've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made
p19
aVfor the conservation of these animals I love so much.
p20
aVAm I being effective
p21
aVin safeguarding their survival?
p22
aVAm I doing enough?
p23
aVI guess the big question here is,
p24
aVam I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation,
p25
aVor am I just documenting their extinction?
p26
aa(lp27
VThe world is facing so many different conservation crises.
p28
aVWe all know that. It's all over the news every day.
p29
aVTropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed,
p30
aVclimate change, so many species on the brink of extinction:
p31
aVtigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.
p32
aa(lp33
VThis is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with,
p34
aVthe largest terrestrial mammal of South America.
p35
aVThey're massive. They're powerful.
p36
aVAdults can weigh up to 300 kilos.
p37
aVThat's half the size of a horse.
p38
aVThey're gorgeous.
p39
aa(lp40
VTapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon,
p41
aVand they absolutely need large patches of habitat
p42
aVin order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive.
p43
aVBut their habitat is being destroyed,
p44
aVand they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd you see, this is very, very unfortunate
p47
aVbecause tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found.
p48
aVThey're herbivores.
p49
aVFifty percent of their diet consists of fruit,
p50
aVand when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds,
p51
aVwhich they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces.
p52
aVThey play this major role in shaping and maintaining
p53
aVthe structure and diversity of the forest,
p54
aVand for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest.
p55
aVIsn't that amazing?
p56
aVIf you think about it,
p57
aVthe extinction of tapirs would seriously affect
p58
aVbiodiversity as a whole.
p59
aa(lp60
VI started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college,
p61
aVand it was a pioneer research and conservation program.
p62
aVAt that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs,
p63
aVmostly because they're so difficult to study.
p64
aVThey're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals,
p65
aVand we got started getting very basic data about these animals.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut what is it that a conservationist does?
p68
aVWell, first, we need data.
p69
aVWe need field research.
p70
aVWe need those long-term datasets to support conservation action,
p71
aVand I told you tapirs are very hard to study,
p72
aVso we have to rely on indirect methods to study them.
p73
aVWe have to capture and anesthetize them
p74
aVso that we can install GPS collars around their necks
p75
aVand follow their movements,
p76
aVwhich is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world.
p77
aVAnd then we can gather information about how they use space,
p78
aVhow they move through the landscape,
p79
aVwhat are their priority habitats,
p80
aVand so much more.
p81
aa(lp82
VNext, we must disseminate what we learn.
p83
aVWe have to educate people about tapirs
p84
aVand how important these animals are.
p85
aVAnd it's amazing how many people around the world
p86
aVdo not know what a tapir is.
p87
aVIn fact, many people think this is a tapir.
p88
aVLet me tell you, this is not a tapir.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VThis is a giant anteater.
p93
aVTapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd then next we have to provide training, capacity building.
p96
aVIt is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future.
p97
aVWe are losing several conservation battles,
p98
aVand we need more people doing what we do,
p99
aVand they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that.
p100
aVUltimately, we conservationists,
p101
aVwe must be able to apply our data,
p102
aVto apply our accumulated knowledge
p103
aVto support actual conservation action.
p104
aVOur first tapir program
p105
aVtook place in the Atlantic Forest
p106
aVin the eastern part of Brazil,
p107
aVone of the most threatened biomes in the world.
p108
aVThe destruction of the Atlantic Forest
p109
aVbegan in the early 1500s,
p110
aVwhen the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil,
p111
aVbeginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America.
p112
aVThis forest was almost completely cleared
p113
aVfor timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities,
p114
aVand today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest
p115
aVis still left standing.
p116
aVAnd tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations.
p117
aVIn the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas
p118
aVof pastureland and agriculture
p119
aVgoing from one patch of forest to patch of forest.
p120
aVSo our main approach in this region
p121
aVwas to use our tapir data to identify the potential places
p122
aVfor the establishment of wildlife corridors
p123
aVin between those patches of forest,
p124
aVreconnecting the habitat
p125
aVso that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely.
p126
aa(lp127
VAfter 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,
p128
aVin 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal
p129
aVin the western part of Brazil
p130
aVnear the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.
p131
aVThis is the largest continuous freshwater floodplain in the world,
p132
aVan incredible place
p133
aVand one of the most important strongholds for lowland tapirs in South America.
p134
aVAnd working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing
p135
aVbecause we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area,
p136
aVand we have been able to study tapirs
p137
aVin the most natural conditions we'll ever find,
p138
aVvery much free of threats.
p139
aa(lp140
VIn the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique:
p141
aVcamera traps.
p142
aVThis camera is equipped with a movement sensor
p143
aVand it photographs animals when they walk in front of it.
p144
aVSo thanks to these amazing devices,
p145
aVwe have been able to gather precious information
p146
aVabout tapir reproduction and social organization
p147
aVwhich are very important pieces of the puzzle
p148
aVwhen you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again
p151
aVto the Brazilian Cerrado,
p152
aVthe open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil.
p153
aVToday this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country,
p154
aVwhere natural habitat and wildlife populations
p155
aVare rapidly being eradicated by several different threats,
p156
aVincluding once again cattle ranching,
p157
aVlarge sugarcane and soybean plantations,
p158
aVpoaching, roadkill, just to name a few.
p159
aVAnd somehow, tapirs are still there,
p160
aVwhich gives me a lot of hope.
p161
aVBut I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado
p162
aVwas a bit of a slap in the face.
p163
aVWhen you drive around
p164
aVand you find dead tapirs along the highways
p165
aVand signs of tapirs wandering around in the middle of sugarcane plantations
p166
aVwhere they shouldn't be,
p167
aVand you talk to kids and they tell you that they know how tapir meat tastes
p168
aVbecause their families poach and eat them,
p169
aVit really breaks your heart.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe situation in the Cerrado made me realize \u2014
p172
aVit gave me the sense of urgency.
p173
aVI am swimming against the tide.
p174
aVIt made me realize that despite two decades of hard work
p175
aVtrying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do
p176
aVif we are to prevent them from disappearing.
p177
aVWe have to find ways to solve all these problems.
p178
aVWe really do, and you know what?
p179
aVWe really came to a point in the conservation world
p180
aVwhere we have to think out of the box.
p181
aVWe'll have to be a lot more creative than we are right now.
p182
aVAnd I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado,
p183
aVso we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers
p184
aVon the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.
p185
aVThese are the same stickers used on big trucks
p186
aVto avoid collision.
p187
aVTapirs cross the highways after dark,
p188
aVso the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing
p189
aVcrossing the highway,
p190
aVand maybe they will slow down a little bit.
p191
aVFor now, this is just a crazy idea.
p192
aVWe don't know. We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.
p193
aVBut the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done.
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd although I'm struggling with all these questions
p196
aVin my mind right now,
p197
aVI have a pact with tapirs.
p198
aVI know in my heart
p199
aVthat tapir conservation is my cause.
p200
aVThis is my passion.
p201
aVI am not alone.
p202
aVI have this huge network of supporters behind me,
p203
aVand there is no way I'm ever going to stop.
p204
aVI will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life.
p205
aVAnd I'll keep doing this for Patrícia, my namesake,
p206
aVone of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest
p207
aVmany, many years ago;
p208
aVfor Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal.
p209
aVAnd I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured
p210
aVin December last year also in the Pantanal.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd I will keep doing this
p213
aVfor the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet
p214
aVover the years
p215
aVand the many others I know I will encounter in the future.
p216
aVThese animals deserve to be cared for.
p217
aVThey need me. They need us.
p218
aVAnd you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world
p219
aVwhere we can get out there and see and benefit from
p220
aVnot only tapirs
p221
aVbut all the other beautiful species,
p222
aVnow and in the future.
p223
aa(lp224
