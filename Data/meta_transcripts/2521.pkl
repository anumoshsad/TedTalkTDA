VI'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,
p4
aVlike all of you.
p5
aVAnd I'm also a social justice comedian,
p6
aVsomething that I insist is an actual job.
p7
aa(lp8
VTo explain what that is, let me tell you how I got here.
p9
aVI've performed all over the country.
p10
aVAnd let me tell you, America is majestic, right?
p11
aVIt's got breathtaking nature,
p12
aVwaffle houses
p13
aVand diabetes as far as the eye can see.
p14
aVIt is really something.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, the American population can be broken up
p17
aVinto three main categories:
p18
aVthere's mostly wonderful people,
p19
aVhaters
p20
aVand Florida.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VBesides Florida, the most troubling category here are the Haters.
p25
aVThey are a minority,
p26
aVbut they overcompensate by being extra loud.
p27
aVThey have the Napoleon complex of demographics,
p28
aVand yes, some of the men do wear heels.
p29
aa(lp30
VAs a social justice comedian,
p31
aVit's my goal to convert these haters,
p32
aVbecause they hate a lot of things, which leads to negative outcomes,
p33
aVlike racism, violence and Ted Nugent.
p34
aVThis is not an exhaustive list;
p35
aVI'm probably missing 3-7 items.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut the point is,
p38
aVwe have to reckon with the haters.
p39
aVBut there's variance within this group
p40
aVand it's not efficient to go after all of them, right?
p41
aVSo what I've done is created a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
p42
aVI basically took all of the haters,
p43
aVI put them in a petri dish, like a scientist,
p44
aVand this is what I found.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VFirst off, we have the trolls.
p49
aVThese are your garden-variety digital haters.
p50
aVThey're the people who quit their jobs
p51
aVso they can post on YouTube videos all day long.
p52
aVThere's also the drive-by haters.
p53
aVNow, these people will be at a stoplight,
p54
aVthey'll wait for the light to turn green
p55
aVand when it does, they yell, "Go back to your own country!"
p56
aVNow back in the day, they would've actually gotten out of their cars
p57
aVand hated you to your face.
p58
aVBut they just don't make them like they used to \u2014
p59
aVwhich is another sign of the decline in America.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VThe next category
p64
aVis the mission-oriented-bigot- whose-group-affiliation-
p65
aVgives-them-cover-for-hating hater.
p66
aVThese guys like to hate via a seemingly nice organization,
p67
aVlike a church or a nonprofit,
p68
aVand they oftentimes like to speak in an old-timey voice.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut the group I'm most interested in is the swing hater.
p71
aVThe swing hater is sister to the swing voter \u2014
p72
aVthey just can't decide!
p73
aVThey're like ideological sluts
p74
aVwho move from hating to not hating.
p75
aVAnd they do it because they don't have enough information.
p76
aVThis is the group I like to target with social justice comedy.
p77
aVWhy comedy?
p78
aVBecause on a scale of comedy to brochure,
p79
aVthe average American prefers comedy, as you can see from this graph.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VComedy is very popular.
p84
aVAnd by the way,
p85
aVthis is a mathematically accurate graph,
p86
aVgenerated from fake numbers.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, the question is:
p91
aVWhy does social justice comedy work?
p92
aVBecause, first off, it makes you laugh.
p93
aVAnd when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.
p94
aVAnd in that moment of openness,
p95
aVa good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information,
p96
aVand if they're really skilled,
p97
aVa rectal exam.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VHere are some ground rules for social justice comedy:
p102
aVfirst off, it's not partisan.
p103
aVThis isn't political comedy, this is about justice,
p104
aVand no one is against justice.
p105
aVTwo, it's inviting and warm,
p106
aVit makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
p107
aVThree, it's funny but sneaky,
p108
aVlike you could be hearing an interesting treatise
p109
aVon income inequality,
p110
aVthat's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VHere's how I see social justice comedy working.
p115
aVA few years ago, I rounded up a bunch of Muslim-American comedians \u2014
p116
aVin a non-violent way \u2014
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd we went around the country
p121
aVto places like Alabama, Arizona, Tennessee, Georgia \u2014
p122
aVplaces where they love the Muzzies \u2014
p123
aVand we did stand-up shows.
p124
aVWe called the tour "The Muslims Are Coming!"
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VWe turned this into a movie,
p129
aVand then after the movie came out,
p130
aVa known hate group spent 300,000 dollars
p131
aVon an anti-Muslim poster campaign
p132
aVwith the MTA \u2014 that's the New York City subway system.
p133
aVNow, the posters were truly offensive,
p134
aVnot to mentioned poorly designed \u2014
p135
aVI mean, if you're going to be bigoted,
p136
aVyou might as well use a better font.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBut we decided, why not launch our own poster campaign
p141
aVthat says nice things about Muslims,
p142
aVwhile promoting the movie.
p143
aVSo myself and fellow comedian Dean Obeidallah
p144
aVdecided to launch the fighting-bigotry- with-delightful-posters campaign.
p145
aVWe raised the money, worked with the MTA for over 5 months,
p146
aVgot the posters approved,
p147
aVand two days after they were supposed to go up,
p148
aVthe MTA decided to ban the posters,
p149
aVciting political content.
p150
aa(lp151
VLet's take a look at a couple of those posters.
p152
aVHere's one.
p153
aVFacts about Muslims:
p154
aVMuslims invented the concept of a hospital.
p155
aVOK.
p156
aVFact: Grown-up Muslims can do more push-ups than baby Muslims.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VFact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VLet's take a look at another one.
p165
aVThe ugly truth about Muslims:
p166
aVthey have great frittata recipes.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow clearly, frittatas are considered political by the MTA.
p169
aVEither that, or the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light
p170
aVwas considered political \u2014 but it isn't.
p171
aVIt's about justice.
p172
aVSo we decided to change
p173
aVour fighting-bigortry- with-delightful-posters campaign
p174
aVand turn it into the fighting-bigotry- with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo basically, what I'm saying is a couple of dirt-bag comedians
p179
aVtook on a major New York City agency
p180
aVand the comedians won.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause and cheers)
p183
aa(lp184
VThank you.
p185
aVVictory was a very weird feeling.
p186
aVI was like, "Is this what blonde girls feel like all the time?
p187
aV'Cause this is amazing!"
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VHere's another example.
p192
aVI'm asked everywhere I go: "Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"
p193
aVWe do. But OK, I'll take the bait.
p194
aVSo I decided to launch thedailydenouncer.com.
p195
aVIt's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week,
p196
aVwhile taking the weekends off.
p197
aVLet's take a look at an example.
p198
aVThey generally appear as single-panel cartoons,
p199
aV"I denounce terrorism! I also denounce people who never fill the paper tray!"
p200
aVThe point of the website is that it denounces terrorism
p201
aVwhile recognizing that it's ridiculous
p202
aVthat we have to constantly denounce terrorism.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut if bigotry isn't your thing,
p205
aVsocial justice comedy is useful for all sorts of issues.
p206
aVFor example, myself and fellow comedian Lee Camp
p207
aVwent to the Cayman Islands to investigate offshore banking.
p208
aVNow, the United States loses something like 300 billion dollars a year
p209
aVin these offshore tax havens.
p210
aVNot to brag,
p211
aVbut at the end of every month,
p212
aVI have something like 5-15 dollars in disposable income.
p213
aVSo we walked into these banks in the Cayman Islands
p214
aVand asked if we could open up a bank account
p215
aVwith eight dollars and 27 cents.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThe bank managers would indulge us for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
p220
aVSecurity would come out, brandish their weapons,
p221
aVand then we would squeal with fear and run away,
p222
aVbecause \u2014 and this is the last rule of social justice comedy \u2014
p223
aVsometimes it makes you want to take a dump in your pants.
p224
aa(lp225
VMost of my work is meant to be fun.
p226
aVIt's meant to generate a connection and laughter.
p227
aVBut yes, sometimes I get run off the grounds by security.
p228
aVSometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.
p229
aVSometimes I get voice mails saying that if I continue telling my jokes,
p230
aVthey'll kill me and they'll kill my family.
p231
aVAnd those death threats are definitely not funny.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut despite the occasional danger,
p234
aVI still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons.
p235
aVI mean, we've tried a lot of approaches to social justice,
p236
aVlike war and competitive ice dancing.
p237
aVBut still, a lot of things are still kind of awful.
p238
aVSo I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.
