(lp3
VWell, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVChris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.
p6
aVAnd since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.
p7
aVBut it slightly bores me.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVAnd, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something \u2014
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aV\u2014 I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,
p12
aVand why Francis and I found it.
p13
aVAnd then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say
p14
aVwhat makes me tick now.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.
p17
aVI was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,
p18
aVand I was in my third year because the University of Chicago
p19
aVlet you in after two years of high school.
p20
aVSo you \u2014 it was fun to get away from high school \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVbecause I was very small, and I was no good in sports,
p22
aVor anything like that.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut I should say that my background \u2014 my father was, you know,
p25
aVraised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,
p26
aVbut after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAnd my mother was Irish Catholic,
p29
aVand \u2014 but she didn't take religion too seriously.
p30
aVAnd by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,
p31
aVand going on birdwatching walks with my father.
p32
aVSo early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.
p33
aVI guess, you know, he was the big hero.
p34
aVAnd, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,
p37
aVand thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,
p38
aVmaybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
p39
aVThen, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book
p40
aVcalled "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
p41
aVAnd that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
p42
aVYou know, Darwin explained life after it got started,
p43
aVbut what was the essence of life?
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd Schrodinger said the essence was information
p46
aVpresent in our chromosomes, and it had to be present
p47
aVon a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
p48
aVYou know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,
p49
aVand somehow all the information was probably present
p50
aVin some digital form. And there was the big question
p51
aVof, how did you copy the information?
p52
aa(lp53
VSo that was the book. And so, from that moment on,
p54
aVI wanted to be a geneticist \u2014
p55
aVunderstand the gene and, through that, understand life.
p56
aVSo I had, you know, a hero at a distance.
p57
aVIt wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.
p58
aVAnd so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVSo I went to Indiana,
p61
aVwhich was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,
p62
aVand besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)
p63
aVSo I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
p64
aVAnd it was at Indiana I got the impression
p65
aVthat, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.
p66
aVAnd so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,
p69
aVmaybe I could become a biochemist,
p70
aVbut I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
p71
aVIt wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;
p72
aVit was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.
p73
aVYou can read it in about two hours.
p74
aVAnd \u2014 but then I went to a meeting in Italy.
p75
aVAnd there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,
p76
aVand he talked about DNA.
p77
aVAnd this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,
p78
aVand after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA
p79
aVbecause DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute
p80
aVto possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.
p81
aVMost people believed it was proteins.
p82
aVBut Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,
p83
aVand he showed this x-ray photograph.
p84
aVSort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,
p85
aVeven though it owed it to probably different molecules
p86
aVcarrying different sets of instructions.
p87
aVSo there was something universal about the DNA molecule.
p88
aVSo I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,
p89
aVand I ended up in Cambridge, England.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I went to Cambridge,
p92
aVbecause it was really the best place in the world then
p93
aVfor x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject
p94
aVin, you know, chemistry departments.
p95
aVI mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.
p96
aVSo the best place for x-ray crystallography
p97
aVwas at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.
p98
aVAnd there I met Francis Crick.
p99
aVI went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.
p100
aVAnd within a day, we had decided that
p101
aVmaybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.
p102
aVNot solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,
p103
aVan electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,
p104
aVlength, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
p105
aVBut just ask what the molecule \u2014 how should it fold up?
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,
p108
aVis Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed
p109
aVthe alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,
p110
aVhe banished the man out on the right,
p111
aVSir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.
p112
aVThis is a photograph several years later,
p113
aVwhen Bragg had cause to smile.
p114
aVHe certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,
p115
aVbecause he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,
p116
aVand the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.
p117
aVAnd certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,
p118
aVso we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.
p119
aVSo Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
p120
aVX-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo we built a three-stranded model.
p123
aVThe people from London came up.
p124
aVWilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,
p125
aVRosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
p126
aVThey said it was lousy, and it was.
p127
aVSo we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVAnd so we didn't build any models,
p130
aVand Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
p131
aVAnd basically, I did nothing. And \u2014 except read.
p132
aVYou know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
p133
aVAnd we kept telling the people in London
p134
aVthat Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.
p135
aVIf DNA is that important, Linus will know it.
p136
aVHe'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.
p137
aa(lp138
VAnd, in fact, he'd written the people in London:
p139
aVCould he see their x-ray photograph?
p140
aVAnd they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it.
p141
aVBut there was ones in the literature.
p142
aVActually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.
p143
aVBut about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,
p144
aVa rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,
p145
aVwho was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.
p146
aVAnd so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,
p147
aVand he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.
p148
aVAnd boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.
p149
aVI have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
p153
aVAnd I read it, and it was just \u2014 it was crap.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVSo this was, you know, unexpected from the world's \u2014
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aV\u2014 and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds
p158
aVbetween phosphate groups.
p159
aVWell, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,
p160
aVthose hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.
p161
aVWe rushed over to the chemistry department and said,
p162
aV"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened
p166
aVthat somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.
p167
aVAnd so Bragg said, "Build models."
p168
aVAnd a month after we got the Pauling manuscript \u2014
p169
aVI should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.
p170
aVWell, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game
p171
aVand that they should immediately start building models.
p172
aVBut Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,
p173
aVand after she left he would start building models.
p174
aVAnd so I came back with that news to Cambridge,
p175
aVand Bragg said, "Build models."
p176
aVWell, of course, I wanted to build models.
p177
aVAnd there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,
p178
aVin one sense she was a chemist,
p179
aVbut really she would have been trained \u2014
p180
aVshe didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.
p181
aVShe was a crystallographer.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models
p184
aVwas, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.
p185
aVAnd so Crick and I, you know, started building models,
p186
aVand I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.
p187
aVWell, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
p188
aVAnd it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:
p189
aVNever be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.
p190
aVWe weren't the best chemists in the room.
p191
aVI went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,
p192
aVand Jerry Donohue \u2014 he was a chemist \u2014 he said, it's wrong.
p193
aVYou've got \u2014 the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.
p194
aVI just put them down like they were in the books.
p195
aVHe said they were wrong.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo the next day, you know, after I thought, "Well, he might be right."
p198
aVSo I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,
p199
aVand Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.
p200
aVAnd we knew we were right.
p201
aVSo it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.
p202
aVFrom nothing to thing.
p203
aVAnd we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T
p204
aVand G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.
p205
aVSo we saw how genetic information is carried.
p206
aVIt's the order of the four bases.
p207
aVSo in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.
p208
aVAnd you copy it by going from strand-separating.
p209
aVSo, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,
p210
aVbecause you didn't have any other scheme.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VBut that's not the way most scientists think.
p214
aVMost scientists are really rather dull.
p215
aVThey said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.
p216
aVBut, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.
p217
aVSo think about it. The next five years,
p218
aVthere were essentially something like five references
p219
aVto our work in "Nature" \u2014 none.
p220
aVAnd so we were left by ourselves,
p221
aVand trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you \u2014
p222
aVwhat does this genetic information do?
p223
aVIt was pretty obvious that it provided the information
p224
aVto an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?
p225
aVFor about three years we just \u2014 I tried to solve the structure of RNA.
p226
aVIt didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
p227
aVI was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.
p228
aVIt was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VSo there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,
p232
aVso I'm still looking happy.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVBut there is what we did when we didn't know
p235
aVwhere to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
p236
aVGeorge Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.
p237
aVHe was one of the members. The question was:
p238
aVHow do you go from a four-letter code
p239
aVto the 20-letter code of proteins?
p240
aVFeynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.
p241
aVBut that's the only \u2014 no, we were only photographed twice.
p242
aVAnd on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.
p243
aVThere's Francis up on the upper right,
p244
aVand Alex Rich \u2014 the M.D.-turned-crystallographer \u2014 is next to me.
p245
aVThis was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.
p246
aVAnd I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,
p247
aVbecause the girl I had, boy, she was gone.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd so I didn't really get happy until 1960,
p251
aVbecause then we found out, basically, you know,
p252
aVthat there are three forms of RNA.
p253
aVAnd we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.
p254
aVRNA provides the information for protein.
p255
aVAnd that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA \u2014 synthetic RNA \u2014
p256
aVput it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,
p257
aVpolyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,
p258
aVand it was all over by 1966.
p259
aVSo there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was \u2014
p260
aVso what happened since then?
p261
aVWell, at that time \u2014 I should go back.
p262
aVWhen we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk
p263
aVat Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,
p264
aVhe looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"
p265
aVAnd \u2014 but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,
p266
aVbecause you couldn't. No use for it.
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,
p270
aVand the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,
p271
aV20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco
p272
aVand Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,
p273
aVand Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.
p274
aVAt least they patented something
p275
aVwhich, you know, could do useful things.
p276
aVAnd then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.
p277
aVAnd, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,
p278
aVbut we were still a long ways from, you know,
p279
aVanswering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,
p280
aVwhich is: How do you nature-nurture?
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,
p283
aVbut this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician
p284
aVturned physicist. And he developed a technique
p285
aVwhich essentially will let us look at sample DNA
p286
aVand, eventually, a million spots along it.
p287
aVThere's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one
p288
aVmade by a photolithography by a company in Madison
p289
aVcalled NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.
p290
aVAnd we use their technique.
p291
aVAnd what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.
p292
aVAnd you can see on the top
p293
aVthat cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.
p294
aVSo the DNA is really badly mucked up,
p295
aVwhereas if you have a chance of surviving,
p296
aVthe DNA isn't so mucked up.
p297
aVSo we think that this will eventually lead to what we call
p298
aV"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,
p299
aVyou should really look at this technique,
p300
aVand get a feeling of the face of the enemy.
p301
aVIt's not a \u2014 it's only a partial look, but it's a \u2014
p302
aVI think it's going to be very, very useful.
p303
aa(lp304
VSo, we started with breast cancer
p305
aVbecause there's lots of money for it, no government money.
p306
aVAnd now I have a sort of vested interest:
p307
aVI want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,
p308
aVyou aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
p309
aVBut Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,
p310
aVand made a really sort of surprising observation.
p311
aVWhich is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome
p312
aVwhere we've lost a gene or gained another one.
p313
aVSo we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,
p314
aVif we're around here, you know,
p315
aVthese little losses or gains might not be too bad.
p316
aVBut if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,
p317
aVmaybe we'll feel sick.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo the first disease he looked at is autism.
p320
aVAnd the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
p321
aVLooking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child
p322
aVwith Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,
p323
aVhad sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.
p324
aVCouldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it
p325
aVwe began to find genes for autism.
p326
aVAnd you can see here, there are a lot of them.
p327
aVSo a lot of autistic kids are autistic
p328
aVbecause they just lost a big piece of DNA.
p329
aVI mean, big piece at the molecular level.
p330
aVWe saw one autistic kid,
p331
aVabout five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.
p332
aVWe haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably
p333
aVdon't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.
p334
aVNow, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.
p335
aVI think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position
p336
aVto help parents who've had an autistic child,
p337
aVor think they may have an autistic child,
p338
aVand can we spot the difference?
p339
aVSo this same technique should probably look at all.
p340
aVIt's a wonderful way to find genes.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd so, I'll conclude by saying
p343
aVwe've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.
p344
aVAnd we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred
p345
aVbefore we got the picture. But as you can see,
p346
aVthere's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.
p347
aVAnd yet, in the controls there were three.
p348
aVSo what's the meaning of the controls?
p349
aVWere they crazy also, and we didn't know it?
p350
aVOr, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.
p351
aVAnd what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,
p352
aVand whether this is one that predisposes \u2014
p353
aVand then there's only a sub-segment of the population
p354
aVthat's capable of being schizophrenic.
p355
aa(lp356
VNow, we don't have really any evidence of it,
p357
aVbut I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess
p358
aVis that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.
p359
aV30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,
p360
aVand schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,
p361
aVwhich means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,
p362
aVbut only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.
p363
aVNow, some people who think they're right-handed
p364
aVare genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,
p365
aVoh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,
p366
aVchildren won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VSo it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.
p370
aVWe ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;
p371
aVthere's a relationship.
p372
aVAnd if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.
p373
aVI thank you.
