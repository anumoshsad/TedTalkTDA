VDoc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity
p4
aVwith this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,
p5
aVand exposure just a millionth of a second.
p6
aVBut now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster
p7
aVand see the world not at a million or a billion,
p8
aVbut one trillion frames per second.
p9
aa(lp10
VI present to you a new type of photography,
p11
aVfemto-photography,
p12
aVa new imaging technique so fast
p13
aVthat it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
p14
aVAnd with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,
p15
aVbeyond line of sight,
p16
aVor see inside our body without an x-ray,
p17
aVand really challenge what we mean by a camera.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off
p20
aVin one trillionth of a second \u2014
p21
aVwhich is several femtoseconds \u2014
p22
aVI'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide.
p23
aVAnd that packet of photons, that bullet,
p24
aVwill travel at the speed of light,
p25
aVand again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.
p26
aVNow, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons
p27
aVand fire into this bottle,
p28
aVhow will those photons shatter into this bottle?
p29
aVHow does light look in slow motion?
p30
aa(lp31
V[Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow]
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, the whole event \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VNow remember, the whole event is effectively taking place
p38
aVin less than a nanosecond \u2014
p39
aVthat's how much time it takes for light to travel.
p40
aVBut I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,
p41
aVso you can see the light in motion.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VBut Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, there's a lot going on in this movie,
p50
aVso let me break this down and show you what's going on.
p51
aVSo the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,
p52
aVwith a packet of photons that start traveling through
p53
aVand that start scattering inside.
p54
aVSome of the light leaks, goes on the table,
p55
aVand you start seeing these ripples of waves.
p56
aVMany of the photons eventually reach the cap
p57
aVand then they explode in various directions.
p58
aVAs you can see, there's a bubble of air
p59
aVand it's bouncing around inside.
p60
aVMeanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,
p61
aVand because of the reflections at the top,
p62
aVyou see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,
p63
aVthe reflections are focused.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, if you take an ordinary bullet
p66
aVand let it go the same distance and slow down the video \u2014
p67
aVagain, by a factor of 10 billion \u2014
p68
aVdo you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VA day, a week? Actually, a whole year.
p73
aVIt'll be a very boring movie \u2014
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
Vof a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd what about some still-life photography?
p80
aVYou can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,
p81
aVthe tomato and the wall in the back.
p82
aVIt's like throwing a stone in a pond of water.
p83
aa(lp84
VI thought: this is how nature paints a photo,
p85
aVone femto frame at a time,
p86
aVbut of course our eye sees an integral composite.
p87
aVBut if you look at this tomato one more time,
p88
aVyou will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,
p89
aVit continues to glow.
p90
aVIt doesn't become dark. Why is that?
p91
aVBecause the tomato is actually ripe,
p92
aVand the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,
p93
aVand it comes out after several trillionths of a second.
p94
aVSo in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,
p95
aVyou might be able to go to a supermarket
p96
aVand check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VSo how did my team at MIT create this camera?
p101
aVNow, as photographers, you know,
p102
aVif you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.
p103
aVBut we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,
p104
aVso you're going to get hardly any light.
p105
aVSo what we do is we send that bullet \u2014
p106
aVthat packet of photons \u2014 millions of times,
p107
aVand record again and again with very clever synchronization,
p108
aVand from the gigabytes of data,
p109
aVwe computationally weave together
p110
aVto create those femto-videos I showed you.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.
p113
aVSo, Superman can fly.
p114
aVSome other heroes can become invisible.
p115
aVBut what about a new power for a future superhero:
p116
aVTo see around corners.
p117
aVThe idea is that we could shine some light on the door,
p118
aVit's going to bounce, go inside the room,
p119
aVsome of that is going to reflect back on the door,
p120
aVand then back to the camera.
p121
aVAnd we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.
p124
aVOn the left, you see our femto-camera.
p125
aVThere's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,
p126
aVand we're going to bounce light off the door.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo after our paper was published in Nature Communications,
p129
aVit was highlighted by Nature.com,
p130
aVand they created this animation.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Music)
p133
aa(lp134
V[A laser pulse is fired]
p135
aa(lp136
V(Music)
p137
aa(lp138
VRamesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light,
p139
aVand they're going to hit this wall,
p140
aVand because of the packet of the photons,
p141
aVthey will scatter in all the directions,
p142
aVand some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,
p143
aVwhich in turn will again scatter that light,
p144
aVand again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light.
p145
aVAnd a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,
p146
aVbut most interestingly,
p147
aVthey will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Music)
p150
aa(lp151
VAnd because we have a camera that can run so fast \u2014
p152
aVour femto-camera \u2014 it has some unique abilities.
p153
aVIt has very good time resolution,
p154
aVand it can look at the world at the speed of light.
p155
aVAnd this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,
p156
aVbut also to the hidden objects,
p157
aVbut we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Music)
p160
aa(lp161
VBy shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,
p162
aVwhich, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.
p163
aVBut then we will take a lot of such pictures,
p164
aVdozens of such pictures, put them together,
p165
aVand try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,
p166
aVand from that, can we see the hidden object?
p167
aVCan we see it in full 3D?
p168
aa(lp169
VSo this is our reconstruction.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Music)
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, we have some ways to go
p176
aVbefore we take this outside the lab on the road,
p177
aVbut in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions
p178
aVwith what's around the bend.
p179
aVOr we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions
p180
aVby looking at light reflected through open windows.
p181
aVOr we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,
p182
aVand also for cardioscopes.
p183
aVBut of course, because of tissue and blood,
p184
aVthis is quite challenging,
p185
aVso this is really a call for scientists
p186
aVto start thinking about femto-photography
p187
aVas really a new imaging modality
p188
aVto solve the next generation of health-imaging problems.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,
p191
aVscience became art \u2014
p192
aVan art of ultra-fast photography.
p193
aVAnd I realized
p194
aVthat all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,
p195
aVare not just for scientific imaging.
p196
aVBut we can also do a new form of computational photography,
p197
aVwith time-lapse and color coding.
p198
aVAnd we look at those ripples.
p199
aVRemember:
p200
aVThe time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut there's also something funny going on here.
p203
aVWhen you look at the ripples under the cap,
p204
aVthe ripples are moving away from us.
p205
aVThe ripples should be moving towards us.
p206
aVWhat's going on here?
p207
aa(lp208
VIt turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,
p209
aVwe have strange effects,
p210
aVand Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VThe order at which events take place in the world
p215
aVappears in the camera sometimes in reversed order.
p216
aVSo by applying the corresponding space and time warp,
p217
aVwe can correct for this distortion.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo whether it's for photography around corners,
p220
aVor creating the next generation of health imaging,
p221
aVor creating new visualizations,
p222
aVsince our invention,
p223
aVwe have open-sourced all the data and details on our website,
p224
aVand our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research communities
p225
aVwill show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras \u2014
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
Vand start focusing on the next dimension in imaging.
p230
aVIt's about time.
p231
aa(lp232
VThank you.
