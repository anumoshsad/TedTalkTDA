VI've been thinking a lot about the world recently
p4
aVand how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
p5
aVTwenty or 30 years ago,
p6
aVif a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died
p7
aVin a remote village in East Asia,
p8
aVit would have been a tragedy for the chicken
p9
aVand its closest relatives,
p10
aVbut I don't think there was much possibility
p11
aVof us fearing a global pandemic
p12
aVand the deaths of millions.
p13
aVTwenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America
p14
aVlent too much money to some people
p15
aVwho couldn't afford to pay it back
p16
aVand the bank went bust,
p17
aVthat was bad for the lender
p18
aVand bad for the borrower,
p19
aVbut we didn't imagine it would bring
p20
aVthe global economic system to its knees
p21
aVfor nearly a decade.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is globalization.
p24
aVThis is the miracle that has enabled us
p25
aVto transship our bodies and our minds
p26
aVand our words and our pictures and our ideas
p27
aVand our teaching and our learning around the planet
p28
aVever faster and ever cheaper.
p29
aVIt's brought a lot of bad stuff,
p30
aVlike the stuff that I just described,
p31
aVbut it's also brought a lot of good stuff.
p32
aVA lot of us are not aware
p33
aVof the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals,
p34
aVseveral of which have achieved their targets
p35
aVlong before the due date.
p36
aVThat proves that this species of humanity
p37
aVis capable of achieving extraordinary progress
p38
aVif it really acts together and it really tries hard.
p39
aVBut if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,
p40
aVI sort of feel that globalization
p41
aVhas taken us by surprise,
p42
aVand we've been slow to respond to it.
p43
aVIf you look at the downside of globalization,
p44
aVit really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.
p45
aVAll of the grand challenges that we face today,
p46
aVlike climate change and human rights
p47
aVand demographics and terrorism and pandemics
p48
aVand narco-trafficking and human slavery
p49
aVand species loss, I could go on,
p50
aVwe're not making an awful lot of progress
p51
aVagainst an awful lot of those challenges.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo in a nutshell, that's the challenge
p54
aVthat we all face today
p55
aVat this interesting point in history.
p56
aVThat's clearly what we've got to do next.
p57
aVWe've somehow got to get our act together
p58
aVand we've got to figure out how to globalize
p59
aVthe solutions better
p60
aVso that we don't simply become a species
p61
aVwhich is the victim of the globalization of problems.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhy are we so slow at achieving these advances?
p64
aVWhat's the reason for it?
p65
aVWell, there are, of course, a number of reasons,
p66
aVbut perhaps the primary reason
p67
aVis because we're still organized as a species
p68
aVin the same way that we were organized
p69
aV200 or 300 years ago.
p70
aVThere's one superpower left on the planet
p71
aVand that is the seven billion people,
p72
aVthe seven billion of us who cause all these problems,
p73
aVthe same seven billion, by the way,
p74
aVwho will resolve them all.
p75
aVBut how are those seven billion organized?
p76
aVThey're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,
p77
aVand the nations have governments
p78
aVthat make rules
p79
aVand cause us to behave in certain ways.
p80
aVAnd that's a pretty efficient system,
p81
aVbut the problem is that the way that those laws are made
p82
aVand the way those governments think
p83
aVis absolutely wrong for the solution of global problems,
p84
aVbecause it all looks inwards.
p85
aVThe politicians that we elect
p86
aVand the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,
p87
aVhave minds that microscope.
p88
aVThey don't have minds that telescope.
p89
aVThey look in. They pretend, they behave,
p90
aVas if they believed that every country was an island
p91
aVthat existed quite happily, independently
p92
aVof all the others
p93
aVon its own little planet
p94
aVin its own little solar system.
p95
aVThis is the problem:
p96
aVcountries competing against each other,
p97
aVcountries fighting against each other.
p98
aVThis week, as any week you care to look at,
p99
aVyou'll find people actually trying to kill each other from country to country,
p100
aVbut even when that's not going on,
p101
aVthere's competition between countries,
p102
aVeach one trying to shaft the next.
p103
aa(lp104
VThis is clearly not a good arrangement.
p105
aVWe clearly need to change it.
p106
aVWe clearly need to find ways
p107
aVof encouraging countries to start working together
p108
aVa little bit better.
p109
aVAnd why won't they do that?
p110
aVWhy is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?
p111
aa(lp112
VWell, the first and most obvious reason
p113
aVis because that's what we ask them to do.
p114
aVThat's what we tell them to do.
p115
aVWhen we elect governments
p116
aVor when we tolerate unelected governments,
p117
aVwe're effectively telling them that what we want
p118
aVis for them to deliver us in our country
p119
aVa certain number of things.
p120
aVWe want them to deliver prosperity,
p121
aVgrowth, competitiveness, transparency, justice
p122
aVand all of those things.
p123
aVSo unless we start asking our governments
p124
aVto think outside a little bit,
p125
aVto consider the global problems that will finish us all
p126
aVif we don't start considering them,
p127
aVthen we can hardly blame them
p128
aVif what they carry on doing is looking inwards,
p129
aVif they still have minds that microscope
p130
aVrather than minds that telescope.
p131
aVThat's the first reason why things tend not to change.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe second reason is that these governments,
p134
aVjust like all the rest of us,
p135
aVare cultural psychopaths.
p136
aVI don't mean to be rude,
p137
aVbut you know what a psychopath is.
p138
aVA psychopath is a person who,
p139
aVunfortunately for him or her,
p140
aVlacks the ability to really empathize
p141
aVwith other human beings.
p142
aVWhen they look around,
p143
aVthey don't see other human beings
p144
aVwith deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives
p145
aVand aims and ambitions.
p146
aVWhat they see is cardboard cutouts,
p147
aVand it's very sad and it's very lonely,
p148
aVand it's very rare, fortunately.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut actually, aren't most of us
p151
aVnot really so very good at empathy?
p152
aVOh sure, we're very good at empathy
p153
aVwhen it's a question of dealing with people
p154
aVwho kind of look like us
p155
aVand kind of walk and talk and eat and pray
p156
aVand wear like us,
p157
aVbut when it comes to people who don't do that,
p158
aVwho don't quite dress like us
p159
aVand don't quite pray like us
p160
aVand don't quite talk like us,
p161
aVdo we not also have a tendency to see them
p162
aVever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?
p163
aVAnd this is a question we need to ask ourselves.
p164
aVI think constantly we have to monitor it.
p165
aVAre we and our politicians to a degree
p166
aVcultural psychopaths?
p167
aa(lp168
VThe third reason is hardly worth mentioning
p169
aVbecause it's so silly,
p170
aVbut there's a belief amongst governments
p171
aVthat the domestic agenda
p172
aVand the international agenda
p173
aVare incompatible and always will be.
p174
aVThis is just nonsense.
p175
aVIn my day job, I'm a policy adviser.
p176
aVI've spent the last 15 years or so
p177
aVadvising governments around the world,
p178
aVand in all of that time I have never once seen
p179
aVa single domestic policy issue
p180
aVthat could not be more imaginatively,
p181
aVeffectively and rapidly resolved
p182
aVthan by treating it as an international problem,
p183
aVlooking at the international context,
p184
aVcomparing what others have done,
p185
aVbringing in others, working externally
p186
aVinstead of working internally.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd so you may say, well, given all of that,
p189
aVwhy then doesn't it work?
p190
aVWhy can we not make our politicians change?
p191
aVWhy can't we demand them?
p192
aVWell I, like a lot of us, spend a lot of time complaining
p193
aVabout how hard it is to make people change,
p194
aVand I don't think we should fuss about it.
p195
aVI think we should just accept
p196
aVthat we are an inherently conservative species.
p197
aVWe don't like to change.
p198
aVIt exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.
p199
aVWe probably wouldn't still be here today
p200
aVif we weren't so resistant to change.
p201
aVIt's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,
p202
aVwe discovered that if we carried on
p203
aVdoing the same things, we wouldn't die,
p204
aVbecause the things that we've done before
p205
aVby definition didn't kill us,
p206
aVand therefore as long as we carry on doing them,
p207
aVwe'll be okay,
p208
aVand it's very sensible not to do anything new,
p209
aVbecause it might kill you.
p210
aVBut of course, there are exceptions to that.
p211
aVOtherwise, we'd never get anywhere.
p212
aVAnd one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,
p213
aVis when you can show to people
p214
aVthat there might be some self-interest
p215
aVin them making that leap of faith
p216
aVand changing a little bit.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years
p219
aVtrying to find out what could be that self-interest
p220
aVthat would encourage not just politicians
p221
aVbut also businesses and general populations,
p222
aVall of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,
p223
aVto think in a bigger picture,
p224
aVnot always to look inwards, sometimes to look outwards.
p225
aVAnd this is where I discovered
p226
aVsomething quite important.
p227
aVIn 2005, I launched a study
p228
aVcalled the Nation Brands Index.
p229
aVWhat it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls
p230
aVa very large sample of the world's population,
p231
aVa sample that represents about 70 percent
p232
aVof the planet's population,
p233
aVand I started asking them a series of questions
p234
aVabout how they perceive other countries.
p235
aVAnd the Nation Brands Index over the years
p236
aVhas grown to be a very, very large database.
p237
aVIt's about 200 billion data points
p238
aVtracking what ordinary people think about other countries
p239
aVand why.
p240
aVWhy did I do this? Well, because the governments that I advise
p241
aVare very, very keen on knowing
p242
aVhow they are regarded.
p243
aVThey've known, partly because
p244
aVI've encouraged them to realize it,
p245
aVthat countries depend
p246
aVenormously on their reputations
p247
aVin order to survive and prosper in the world.
p248
aVIf a country has a great, positive image,
p249
aVlike Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,
p250
aVeverything is easy and everything is cheap.
p251
aVYou get more tourists. You get more investors.
p252
aVYou sell your products more expensively.
p253
aVIf, on the other hand, you have a country
p254
aVwith a very weak or a very negative image,
p255
aVeverything is difficult and everything is expensive.
p256
aVSo governments care desperately
p257
aVabout the image of their country,
p258
aVbecause it makes a direct difference
p259
aVto how much money they can make,
p260
aVand that's what they've promised their populations
p261
aVthey're going to deliver.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo a couple of years ago, I thought I would take
p264
aVsome time out and speak to that gigantic database
p265
aVand ask it,
p266
aVwhy do some people prefer one country
p267
aVmore than another?
p268
aVAnd the answer that the database gave me
p269
aVcompletely staggered me.
p270
aVIt was 6.8.
p271
aVI haven't got time to explain in detail.
p272
aVBasically what it told me was \u2014
p273
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p274
aVthe kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.
p275
aVWe don't admire countries primarily because they're rich,
p276
aVbecause they're powerful, because they're successful,
p277
aVbecause they're modern, because they're technologically advanced.
p278
aVWe primarily admire countries that are good.
p279
aVWhat do we mean by good?
p280
aVWe mean countries that seem to contribute
p281
aVsomething to the world in which we live,
p282
aVcountries that actually make the world safer
p283
aVor better or richer or fairer.
p284
aVThose are the countries we like.
p285
aVThis is a discovery of significant importance \u2014
p286
aVyou see where I'm going \u2014
p287
aVbecause it squares the circle.
p288
aVI can now say, and often do, to any government,
p289
aVin order to do well, you need to do good.
p290
aVIf you want to sell more products,
p291
aVif you want to get more investment,
p292
aVif you want to become more competitive,
p293
aVthen you need to start behaving,
p294
aVbecause that's why people will respect you
p295
aVand do business with you,
p296
aVand therefore, the more you collaborate,
p297
aVthe more competitive you become.
p298
aa(lp299
VThis is quite an important discovery,
p300
aVand as soon as I discovered this,
p301
aVI felt another index coming on.
p302
aVI swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler
p303
aVand more and more childish.
p304
aVThis one is called the Good Country Index,
p305
aVand it does exactly what it says on the tin.
p306
aVIt measures, or at least it tries to measure,
p307
aVexactly how much each country on Earth contributes
p308
aVnot to its own population but to the rest of humanity.
p309
aVBizarrely, nobody had ever thought
p310
aVof measuring this before.
p311
aVSo my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent
p312
aVthe best part of the last two years,
p313
aVwith the help of a large number of very serious and clever people,
p314
aVcramming together all the reliable data in the world
p315
aVwe could find about what countries give
p316
aVto the world.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd you're waiting for me to tell you which one comes top.
p319
aVAnd I'm going to tell you,
p320
aVbut first of all I want to tell you
p321
aVprecisely what I mean
p322
aVwhen I say a good country.
p323
aVI do not mean morally good.
p324
aVWhen I say that Country X
p325
aVis the goodest country on Earth,
p326
aVand I mean goodest, I don't mean best.
p327
aVBest is something different.
p328
aVWhen you're talking about a good country,
p329
aVyou can be good, gooder and goodest.
p330
aVIt's not the same thing as good, better and best.
p331
aVThis is a country which simply gives more
p332
aVto humanity than any other country.
p333
aVI don't talk about how they behave at home
p334
aVbecause that's measured elsewhere.
p335
aVAnd the winner is
p336
aVIreland.
p337
aV(Applause)
p338
aVAccording to the data here,
p339
aVno country on Earth, per head of population,
p340
aVper dollar of GDP, contributes more
p341
aVto the world that we live in than Ireland.
p342
aVWhat does this mean?
p343
aVThis means that as we go to sleep at night,
p344
aVall of us in the last 15 seconds before we drift off to sleep,
p345
aVour final thought should be,
p346
aVgodammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVAnd that \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p349
aVIn the depths of a very severe economic recession,
p350
aVI think that there's a really important lesson there,
p351
aVthat if you can remember your international obligations
p352
aVwhilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,
p353
aVthat's really something.
p354
aVFinland ranks pretty much the same.
p355
aVThe only reason why it's below Ireland
p356
aVis because its lowest score is lower than Ireland's lowest score.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow the other thing you'll notice about the top 10 there
p359
aVis, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,
p360
aVWestern European nations.
p361
aVThey're also all rich.
p362
aVThis depressed me,
p363
aVbecause one of the things that I did not want
p364
aVto discover with this index
p365
aVis that it's purely the province of rich countries
p366
aVto help poor countries.
p367
aVThis is not what it's all about.
p368
aVAnd indeed, if you look further down the list,
p369
aVI don't have the slide here, you will see
p370
aVsomething that made me very happy indeed,
p371
aVthat Kenya is in the top 30,
p372
aVand that demonstrates one very, very important thing.
p373
aVThis is not about money.
p374
aVThis is about attitude.
p375
aVThis is about culture.
p376
aVThis is about a government and a people that care
p377
aVabout the rest of the world
p378
aVand have the imagination and the courage
p379
aVto think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.
p380
aa(lp381
VI'm going to whip through the other slides
p382
aVjust so you can see some of the lower-lying countries.
p383
aVThere's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,
p384
aVMexico comes 66th,
p385
aVand then we have some of the big developing countries,
p386
aVlike Russia at 95th, China at 107th.
p387
aVCountries like China and Russia and India,
p388
aVwhich is down in the same part of the index,
p389
aVwell, in some ways, it's not surprising.
p390
aVThey've spent a great deal of time
p391
aVover the last decades building their own economy,
p392
aVbuilding their own society and their own polity,
p393
aVbut it is to be hoped
p394
aVthat the second phase of their growth
p395
aVwill be somewhat more outward-looking
p396
aVthan the first phase has been so far.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd then you can break down each country
p399
aVin terms of the actual datasets that build into it.
p400
aVI'll allow you to do that.
p401
aVFrom midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org,
p402
aVand you can look at the country.
p403
aVYou can look right down to the level of the individual datasets.
p404
aa(lp405
VNow that's the Good Country Index.
p406
aVWhat's it there for?
p407
aVWell, it's there really because I want to try
p408
aVto introduce this word,
p409
aVor reintroduce this word, into the discourse.
p410
aVI've had enough hearing about competitive countries.
p411
aVI've had enough hearing about
p412
aVprosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.
p413
aVI've even had enough hearing about happy countries
p414
aVbecause in the end that's still selfish.
p415
aVThat's still about us,
p416
aVand if we carry on thinking about us,
p417
aVwe are in deep, deep trouble.
p418
aVI think we all know what it is
p419
aVthat we want to hear about.
p420
aVWe want to hear about good countries,
p421
aVand so I want to ask you all a favor.
p422
aVI'm not asking a lot.
p423
aVIt's something that you might find easy to do
p424
aVand you might even find enjoyable
p425
aVand even helpful to do,
p426
aVand that's simply to start using the word "good"
p427
aVin this context.
p428
aVWhen you think about your own country,
p429
aVwhen you think about other people's countries,
p430
aVwhen you think about companies,
p431
aVwhen you talk about the world that we live in today,
p432
aVstart using that word
p433
aVin the way that I've talked about this evening.
p434
aVNot good, the opposite of bad,
p435
aVbecause that's an argument that never finishes.
p436
aVGood, the opposite of selfish,
p437
aVgood being a country that thinks about all of us.
p438
aVThat's what I would like you to do,
p439
aVand I'd like you to use it as a stick
p440
aVwith which to beat your politicians.
p441
aVWhen you elect them, when you reelect them,
p442
aVwhen you vote for them, when you listen
p443
aVto what they're offering you,
p444
aVuse that word, "good,"
p445
aVand ask yourself,
p446
aV"Is that what a good country would do?"
p447
aVAnd if the answer is no, be very suspicious.
p448
aVAsk yourself, is that the behavior
p449
aVof my country?
p450
aVDo I want to come from a country
p451
aVwhere the government, in my name,
p452
aVis doing things like that?
p453
aVOr do I, on the other hand,
p454
aVprefer the idea of walking around the world
p455
aVwith my head held high thinking, "Yeah,
p456
aVI'm proud to come from a good country"?
p457
aVAnd everybody will welcome you.
p458
aVAnd everybody in the last 15 seconds
p459
aVbefore they drift off to sleep at night will say,
p460
aV"Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."
p461
aa(lp462
VUltimately, that, I think,
p463
aVis what will make the change.
