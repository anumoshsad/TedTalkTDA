VIf you think about the phone \u2014
p4
aVand Intel has tested
p5
aVa lot of the things I'm going to show you,
p6
aVover the last 10 years,
p7
aVin about 600 elderly households \u2014
p8
aV300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland \u2014
p9
aVtrying to understand: How do we measure
p10
aVand monitor behavior
p11
aVin a medically meaningful way?
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd if you think about the phone, right,
p14
aVit's something that we can use for some incredible ways
p15
aVto help people actually take the right medication at the right time.
p16
aVWe're testing these kinds of simple
p17
aVsensor-network technologies in the home
p18
aVso that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with
p19
aVcan help them deal with their medications.
p20
aVAnd a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,
p21
aVand it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,
p22
aVand they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.
p23
aVAnd they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,
p24
aVthat sits on their kitchen table and says,
p25
aV"I'm old. I'm frail."
p26
aVIt's surreptitious technology
p27
aVthat's helping them do a simple task
p28
aVof taking the right pill at the right time.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.
p31
aVBecause that moment when you answer the phone
p32
aVis a cognitive test every time that you do it.
p33
aVThink about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.
p34
aV"Hello? Hey."
p35
aVAll right? That's the first time.
p36
aV"Hello? Uh, hey."
p37
aV"Hello? Uh, who?
p38
aVOh, hey."
p39
aVAll right? Very big differences
p40
aVbetween the way I answered the phone the three times.
p41
aVAnd as we monitor phone usage
p42
aVby seniors over a long period of time,
p43
aVdown to the tenths of a microsecond,
p44
aVthat recognition moment
p45
aVof whether they can figure out that person on the other end
p46
aVis a friend and we start talking to them immediately,
p47
aVor they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,
p48
aVwhere they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?
p49
aVWaiting for that recognition moment
p50
aVmay be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia
p51
aVthan anything that shows up clinically today.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe call these behavioral markers.
p54
aVThere's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone
p55
aVas quickly, when it rings, as they used to?
p56
aVIs it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?
p57
aVHas their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people
p58
aVwith Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,
p59
aVwhere that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients
p60
aVmay be the best early indicator
p61
aVof Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.
p62
aVBut those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time
p63
aVare hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme
p64
aVand your voice has become so quiet.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
p67
aVWhen you pick up the phone,
p68
aVhow much tremor are you having,
p69
aVand what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?
p70
aVAre you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?
p71
aVIs it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?
p72
aVAre you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?
p73
aVAnd looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health
p74
aVmean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?
p75
aVAnd then wow, what a radical idea,
p76
aVwe \u2014 except in the United States \u2014
p77
aVmight be able to use this newfangled technology
p78
aVto actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.
p79
aVWow, what a great day that will be
p80
aVonce we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, these are what I would call behavioral markers.
p83
aVAnd it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on
p84
aVfor the last 10 years at Intel.
p85
aVHow do you put simple disruptive technologies,
p86
aVand the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?
p87
aVBehavioral markers matter.
p88
aVHow do we change behavior?
p89
aVHow do we measure changes in behavior
p90
aVin a meaningful way that's going to help us with
p91
aVprevention of disease, early onset of disease,
p92
aVand tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, why would Intel let me
p95
aVspend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,
p96
aVtrying to understand the needs of seniors
p97
aVand start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?
p98
aVThis is some of the field work that we've done.
p99
aVWe have now lived with 1,000 elderly households
p100
aVin 20 countries over the last 10 years.
p101
aVWe study people in Rochester, New York.
p102
aVWe go live with them in the winter
p103
aVbecause what they do in the winter,
p104
aVand their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,
p105
aVis very different than in the summer.
p106
aVIf they have a hip fracture we go with them
p107
aVand we study their entire discharge experience.
p108
aVIf they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,
p109
aVwe fly and study them as well.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, we study the holistic health experience
p112
aVof 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years
p113
aVin 20 different countries.
p114
aVWhy is Intel willing to fund that?
p115
aVIt's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.
p116
aVTen years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel
p117
aVto let me go start looking at disruptive technologies
p118
aVthat could help with independent living,
p119
aVthis is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."
p120
aa(lp121
VYou know, back in 2000,
p122
aVwe were all so obsessed with paying attention
p123
aVto the aging of our computers,
p124
aVand whether or not they were going to survive
p125
aVthe tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,
p126
aVthat we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.
p127
aVIt was right around New Years.
p128
aVAnd that switchover,
p129
aVwhen we had the larger number of older people on the planet,
p130
aVfor the first time than younger people.
p131
aVFor the first time in human history \u2014 and barring aliens landing
p132
aVor some major other pandemic,
p133
aVthat's the expectation from demographers, going forward.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time
p136
aVto convince Intel to work on this. Right?
p137
aVY2K + 10 was coming,
p138
aVthe baby boomers starting to retire.
p139
aVWell folks, it's like we know these demographics here.
p140
aVThis is a map of the entire world.
p141
aVIt's like the lights are on,
p142
aVbut nobody's home on this demographic
p143
aVY2K + 10 problem. Right?
p144
aVI mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,
p145
aVand we're not doing anything about it.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe health reform bill is largely ignoring
p148
aVthe realities of the age wave that's coming,
p149
aVand the implications for what we need to do to change
p150
aVnot only how we pay for care,
p151
aVbut deliver care in some radically different ways.
p152
aVAnd in fact, it's upon us.
p153
aVI mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey
p154
aVwho is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.
p155
aVThat actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.
p156
aVShe was born one second after midnight in 1946.
p157
aVA retired school teacher,
p158
aVthere she is with a Social Security administrator.
p159
aVThe first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.
p160
aVWe're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.
p161
aa(lp162
VAll right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.
p163
aVThis is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,
p164
aVbut somehow we can't sort of marshal our government
p165
aVand innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it
p166
aVand do something about it. We'll wait until
p167
aVit's more of a catastrophe, and react,
p168
aVas opposed to prepare for it.
p169
aVSo, one of the reasons it's so
p170
aVchallenging to prepare for this Y2K problem
p171
aVis, I want to argue, we have what I would call
p172
aVmainframe poisoning.
p173
aa(lp174
VAndy Grove, about six or seven years ago,
p175
aVhe doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article
p176
aVhe used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"
p177
aVand I've been extending and expanding this.
p178
aVHe saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."
p179
aVI was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.
p180
aVI just extended it."
p181
aVYou know, this is the mainframe.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis mentality of traveling to
p184
aVand timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems
p185
aVactually began in 1787.
p186
aVThis is the first general hospital in Vienna.
p187
aVAnd actually the second general hospital in Vienna,
p188
aVin about 1850, was where we started to build out
p189
aVan entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.
p190
aVAnd it's a place in which we started developing
p191
aVarchitecture that literally divided the body,
p192
aVand divided care into departments and compartments.
p193
aVAnd it was reflected in our architecture,
p194
aVit was reflected in the way that we taught students,
p195
aVand this mainframe mentality persists today.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, I'm not anti-hospital.
p198
aVWith my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,
p199
aVI've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.
p200
aVBut we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?
p201
aVAnd this is mainframe healthcare.
p202
aVAnd just as 30 years ago
p203
aVwe couldn't conceive that we would have the power
p204
aVof a mainframe computer that took up a room this size
p205
aVin our purses and on our belts,
p206
aVthat we're carrying around in our cell phone today,
p207
aVand suddenly, computing,
p208
aVthat used to be an expert driven system,
p209
aVit was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives \u2014
p210
aVthat shift from mainframe to personal computing
p211
aVis what we have to do for healthcare.
p212
aVWe have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare
p213
aVto a personal model of healthcare.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe are obsessed with this way of thinking.
p216
aVWhen Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,
p217
aV"Quick response: healthcare."
p218
aVThe first word that comes up is "doctor."
p219
aVThe second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?
p220
aVWe are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare
p221
aVand healthcare innovation as something
p222
aVthat goes into that place.
p223
aVOur entire health reform discussion right now,
p224
aVhealth I.T., when we talk with policy makers,
p225
aVequals "How are we going to get doctors using
p226
aVelectronic medical records in the mainframe?"
p227
aVWe're not thinking about
p228
aVhow do we shift from the mainframe to the home.
p229
aVAnd the problem with this is
p230
aVthe way we conceive healthcare. Right?
p231
aa(lp232
VThis is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.
p233
aVWe're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
p234
aVIt's population-based.
p235
aVWe collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,
p236
aVand we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,
p237
aVand send them home,
p238
aVand hope \u2014 we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website \u2014
p239
aVthat they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.
p242
aVWe can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.
p243
aVAnd now we want to do a double-double
p244
aVof the age wave coming through?
p245
aVBusiness as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.
p246
aVWe've got to focus on the home.
p247
aa(lp248
VWe've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm
p249
aVthat moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,
p250
aVprevention-driven?
p251
aVHow do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?
p252
aVHow do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?
p253
aVHow do we collect not just biological data
p254
aVbut behavioral data, psychological data,
p255
aVrelational data, in and on and around the home?
p256
aVAnd how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan
p257
aVthat uses all this great technology that's around us
p258
aVto change our behavior?
p259
aVThat's what we need to do for our personal health model.
p260
aa(lp261
VI want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi
p262
aVfrom one of our studies \u2014
p263
aVin her 90s, had to move out of her home
p264
aVbecause her family was worried about falls.
p265
aVRaise your hand if you had a serious fall
p266
aVin your household, or any of your loved ones,
p267
aVyour parents or so forth. Right?
p268
aVClassic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.
p269
aVThis is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,
p270
aVmoved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.
p271
aVShe tripped over her oxygen tank.
p272
aa(lp273
VMany people in this generation won't press the button,
p274
aVeven if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,
p275
aVeven though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.
p276
aVBoomers will press the button. Trust me.
p277
aVThey're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?
p278
aa(lp279
VMimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,
p280
aVfinally somebody came in and found her,
p281
aVsent her to the hospital.
p282
aVThey fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back
p283
aVinto the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.
p284
aVFirst night in the nursing home unit where she had been
p285
aVin the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,
p286
aVkind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,
p287
aVsent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,
p288
aVno one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,
p289
aVwhich she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,
p290
aVbasically, had heart problems, and died
p291
aVfrom the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, the most frightening thing about this is
p294
aVthis is my wife's grandmother.
p295
aVNow, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,
p296
aVI work for Intel, I make a good salary,
p297
aVI'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries \u2014
p298
aVit's an area of research that I work on.
p299
aVI have access to senators and CEOs.
p300
aVI can't stop this from happening.
p301
aVWhat happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English
p302
aVor don't have the kind of access
p303
aVto deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?
p304
aVHow do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls
p305
aVfrom ever occurring in the first place?
p306
aa(lp307
VLet me give you a quick example of work that we're doing
p308
aVto try to do exactly that.
p309
aVI've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.
p310
aVIt's a research platform.
p311
aVIt has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.
p312
aVThere is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play
p313
aVkind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,
p314
aVin the real world,
p315
aVthings like tremor, gait,
p316
aVstride length and those kinds of things.
p317
aa(lp318
VThe problem is, our understanding of falls today,
p319
aVlike Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,
p320
aVfrom the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"
p321
aVThat's sort of the state of the art.
p322
aVBut with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,
p323
aVembedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems
p324
aVthat we borrowed from sports medicine,
p325
aVwe're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households
p326
aVto collect actual kinematic motion data
p327
aVto understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring
p328
aVthat can show us that mom has become risk at falls?
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd most often we can do two interventions,
p331
aVfix the meds mix.
p332
aVI'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in
p333
aVfrom these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day
p334
aVthat some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else
p335
aVknew that they were on, because we see the changes
p336
aVin their patterns in the household. Right?
p337
aVThese discoveries of behavioral markers,
p338
aVand behavioral changes
p339
aVare game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope
p340
aVbecause of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.
p341
aa(lp342
VThis is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland
p343
aVof \u2014 actually what you're seeing is
p344
aVshe's looking at data,
p345
aVin this picture, from the Magic Carpet.
p346
aVSo, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,
p347
aVand look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.
p348
aVHere's what some of this data might look like.
p349
aVThis is actually sensor firings.
p350
aa(lp351
VThese are two different subjects in our study.
p352
aVIt's about a year's worth of data.
p353
aVThe color represents different rooms they are in the house.
p354
aVThis person on the left is living in their own home.
p355
aVThis person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.
p356
aVI know this because look at how punctuated meal time is
p357
aVwhen they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?
p358
aVNow, this doesn't mean that much to you.
p359
aVBut when we look at these cycles of data
p360
aVover a longer period of time \u2014 and we're looking at everything from
p361
aVmotion around different rooms in the house,
p362
aVto sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,
p363
aVabout gait and stride length \u2014 these streams of data
p364
aVare starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns
p365
aVthat we've never understood before.
p366
aa(lp367
VYou can go to ORCATech.org \u2014
p368
aVit has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology \u2014
p369
aVto see more about that.
p370
aVThe problem is, Intel is still one of the largest
p371
aVfunders in the world
p372
aVof independent living technology research.
p373
aVI'm not bragging about how much we fund;
p374
aVit's how little anyone else actually pays attention
p375
aVto aging and funds innovation on aging,
p376
aVchronic disease management and independent living in the home.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:
p379
aV10,000 households or bust.
p380
aVWe need to drive
p381
aVa national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study
p382
aVof independent living technologies,
p383
aVwhere we have 10,000 elderly connected households
p384
aVwith broadband, full medical characterization,
p385
aVand a platform by which we can start to experiment
p386
aVand turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies
p387
aVthat the universities fund,
p388
aVto large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.
p389
aVSo, 10,000 households or bust.
p390
aVThese are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.
p391
aa(lp392
VMy fifth and final phrase:
p393
aVI have tried for two years,
p394
aVand there were moments when we were quite close,
p395
aVto make this healthcare reform bill be about reform
p396
aVfrom something and to something,
p397
aVfrom a mainframe model
p398
aVto a personal health model,
p399
aVor to mean something more than just a debate
p400
aVabout the public option and how we're going to finance.
p401
aVIt doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.
p402
aVWe're going to figure something out
p403
aVfor the next 10 years, and try it.
p404
aVNo matter who pays for it,
p405
aVwe better start doing care in a fundamentally different way
p406
aVand treating the home and the patient
p407
aVand the family member and the caregivers
p408
aVas part of these coordinated care teams
p409
aVand using disruptive technologies that are already here
p410
aVto do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.
p411
aa(lp412
VThe president needs to stand up and say,
p413
aVat the end of a healthcare reform debate,
p414
aV"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care
p415
aVout of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,
p416
aVto the home, in 10 years."
p417
aVIt's achievable. We should do it economically,
p418
aVwe should do it morally,
p419
aVand we should do it for quality of life.
p420
aVBut there is no goal within this health reform.
p421
aVIt's just a mess today.
p422
aa(lp423
VSo, you know, that's my last message to you.
p424
aVHow do we set a going-to-the-moon goal
p425
aVof dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?
p426
aVIt's not that innovation and technology is going to be the
p427
