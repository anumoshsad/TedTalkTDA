VI'd like to talk today
p4
aVabout how we can change our brains
p5
aVand our society.
p6
aa(lp7
VMeet Joe.
p8
aVJoe's 32 years old and a murderer.
p9
aVI met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing
p10
aVat Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.
p11
aVI'd like you to imagine this place.
p12
aVIt looks and feels like it sounds:
p13
aVWormwood Scrubs.
p14
aVBuilt at the end of the Victorian Era
p15
aVby the inmates themselves,
p16
aVit is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept.
p17
aVThese individuals have committed acts
p18
aVof unspeakable evil.
p19
aVAnd I was there to study their brains.
p20
aVI was part of a team of researchers
p21
aVfrom University College London,
p22
aVon a grant from the U.K. department of health.
p23
aVMy task was to study a group of inmates
p24
aVwho had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.
p25
aVThat meant they were the most
p26
aVcallous and the most aggressive
p27
aVof the entire prison population.
p28
aVWhat lay at the root of their behavior?
p29
aVWas there a neurological cause for their condition?
p30
aVAnd if there was a neurological cause,
p31
aVcould we find a cure?
p32
aa(lp33
VSo I'd like to speak about change, and  especially about emotional change.
p34
aVGrowing up, I was always intrigued
p35
aVby how people change.
p36
aVMy mother, a clinical psychotherapist,
p37
aVwould occasionally see patients at home
p38
aVin the evening.
p39
aVShe would shut the door to the living room,
p40
aVand I imagined
p41
aVmagical things happened in that room.
p42
aVAt the age of five or six
p43
aVI would creep up in my pajamas
p44
aVand sit outside with my ear glued to the door.
p45
aVOn more than one occasion, I fell asleep
p46
aVand they had to push me out of the way
p47
aVat the end of the session.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I suppose that's how I found myself
p50
aVwalking into the secure interview room
p51
aVon my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.
p52
aVJoe sat across a steel table
p53
aVand greeted me with this blank expression.
p54
aVThe prison warden, looking equally indifferent,
p55
aVsaid, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,
p56
aVand we'll be around as soon as we can."
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI sat down.
p60
aVThe heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.
p61
aVI looked up at the red buzzer
p62
aVfar behind Joe on the opposite wall.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VI looked at Joe.
p66
aVPerhaps detecting my concern,
p67
aVhe leaned forward, and said,
p68
aVas reassuringly as he could,
p69
aV"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,
p70
aVit doesn't work anyway."
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VOver the subsequent months,
p74
aVwe tested Joe and his fellow inmates,
p75
aVlooking specifically at their ability
p76
aVto categorize different images of emotion.
p77
aVAnd we looked at their physical response
p78
aVto those emotions.
p79
aVSo, for example, when most of us look
p80
aVat a picture like this of somebody looking sad,
p81
aVwe instantly have a slight,
p82
aVmeasurable physical response:
p83
aVincreased heart rate, sweating of the skin.
p84
aVWhilst the psychopaths in our study were able
p85
aVto describe the pictures accurately,
p86
aVthey failed to show the emotions required.
p87
aVThey failed to show a physical response.
p88
aVIt was as though they knew the words
p89
aVbut not the music of empathy.
p90
aVSo we wanted to look closer at this
p91
aVto use MRI to image their brains.
p92
aVThat turned out to be not such an easy task.
p93
aVImagine transporting a collection
p94
aVof clinical psychopaths across central London
p95
aVin shackles and handcuffs
p96
aVin rush hour,
p97
aVand in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner,
p98
aVyou have to remove all metal objects,
p99
aVincluding shackles and handcuffs,
p100
aVand, as I learned, all body piercings.
p101
aa(lp102
VAfter some time, however, we had a tentative answer.
p103
aVThese individuals were not just the victims
p104
aVof a troubled childhood.
p105
aVThere was something else.
p106
aVPeople like Joe have a deficit in a brain area
p107
aVcalled the amygdala.
p108
aVThe amygdala is an almond-shaped organ
p109
aVdeep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.
p110
aVIt is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.
p111
aVNormally, the more empathic a person is,
p112
aVthe larger and more active their amygdala is.
p113
aVOur population of inmates
p114
aVhad a deficient amygdala,
p115
aVwhich likely led to their lack of empathy
p116
aVand to their immoral behavior.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo let's take a step back.
p119
aVNormally, acquiring moral behavior
p120
aVis simply part of growing up,
p121
aVlike learning to speak.
p122
aVAt the age of six months, virtually every one of us
p123
aVis able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects.
p124
aVAt the age of 12 months,
p125
aVmost children are able to imitate
p126
aVthe purposeful actions of others.
p127
aVSo for example, your mother raises her hands
p128
aVto stretch, and you imitate her behavior.
p129
aVAt first, this isn't perfect.
p130
aVI remember my cousin Sasha,
p131
aVtwo years old at the time,
p132
aVlooking through a picture book
p133
aVand licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand,
p134
aVlicking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVBit by bit, we build the foundations  of the social brain
p137
aVso that by the time we're three, four years old,
p138
aVmost children, not all,
p139
aVhave acquired the ability to understand
p140
aVthe intentions of others,
p141
aVanother prerequisite for empathy.
p142
aVThe fact that this developmental progression
p143
aVis universal,
p144
aVirrespective of where you live in the world
p145
aVor which culture you inhabit,
p146
aVstrongly suggests that the foundations
p147
aVof moral behavior are inborn.
p148
aVIf you doubt this,
p149
aVtry, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made
p150
aVto a four-year-old.
p151
aVYou will find that the mind of a four-year old
p152
aVis not naïve in the slightest.
p153
aVIt is more akin to a Swiss army knife
p154
aVwith fixed mental modules
p155
aVfinely honed during development
p156
aVand a sharp sense of fairness.
p157
aVThe early years are crucial.
p158
aVThere seems to be a window of opportunity,
p159
aVafter which mastering moral questions
p160
aVbecomes more difficult,
p161
aVlike adults learning a foreign language.
p162
aVThat's not to say it's impossible.
p163
aVA recent, wonderful study from Stanford University
p164
aVshowed that people who have played
p165
aVa virtual reality game in which they took on
p166
aVthe role of a good and helpful superhero
p167
aVactually became more caring and helpful
p168
aVtowards others afterwards.
p169
aVNow I'm not suggesting
p170
aVwe endow criminals with superpowers,
p171
aVbut I am suggesting that we need to find ways
p172
aVto get Joe and people like him
p173
aVto change their brains and their behavior,
p174
aVfor their benefit
p175
aVand for the benefit of the rest of us.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo can brains change?
p178
aVFor over 100 years,
p179
aVneuroanatomists and later neuroscientists
p180
aVheld the view that after initial development in childhood,
p181
aVno new brain cells could grow
p182
aVin the adult human brain.
p183
aVThe brain could only change
p184
aVwithin certain set limits.
p185
aVThat was the dogma.
p186
aVBut then, in the 1990s,
p187
aVstudies starting showing,
p188
aVfollowing the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others,
p189
aVstudies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis,
p190
aVthe birth of new brain cells
p191
aVin the adult mammalian brain,
p192
aVfirst in the olfactory bulb,
p193
aVwhich is responsible for our sense of smell,
p194
aVthen in the hippocampus
p195
aVinvolving short-term memory,
p196
aVand finally in the amygdala itself.
p197
aVIn order to understand
p198
aVhow this process works,
p199
aVI left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford
p200
aVspecializing in learning and development.
p201
aVInstead of psychopaths, I studied mice,
p202
aVbecause the same pattern of brain responses
p203
aVappears across many different species of social animals.
p204
aVSo if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,
p205
aVa shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,
p206
aValone and without much stimulation,
p207
aVnot only does it not thrive,
p208
aVbut it will often develop strange,
p209
aVrepetitive behaviors.
p210
aVThis naturally sociable animal
p211
aVwill lose its ability to bond with other mice,
p212
aVeven becoming aggressive when introduced to them.
p213
aVHowever, mice reared in what we called
p214
aVan enriched environment,
p215
aVa large habitation with other mice
p216
aVwith wheels and ladders and areas to explore,
p217
aVdemonstrate neurogenesis,
p218
aVthe birth of new brain cells,
p219
aVand as we showed, they also perform better
p220
aVon a range of learning and memory tasks.
p221
aVNow, they don't develop morality to the point of
p222
aVcarrying the shopping bags of little old mice
p223
aVacross the street,
p224
aVbut their improved environment results in healthy,
p225
aVsociable behavior.
p226
aVMice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,
p227
aVnot dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,
p228
aVhave dramatically lower levels of new neurons
p229
aVin the brain.
p230
aa(lp231
VIt is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,
p232
aVincluding primates like us,
p233
aVcan show neurogenesis.
p234
aVIn some areas of the brain,
p235
aVmore than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.
p236
aVWe're just beginning to understand
p237
aVwhat exact function these cells have,
p238
aVbut what it implies is that the brain is capable
p239
aVof extraordinary change way into adulthood.
p240
aVHowever, our brains are also
p241
aVexquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.
p242
aVStress hormones, glucocorticoids,
p243
aVreleased by the brain,
p244
aVsuppress the growth of these new cells.
p245
aVThe more stress, the less brain development,
p246
aVwhich in turn causes less adaptability
p247
aVand causes higher stress levels.
p248
aVThis is the interplay between nature and nurture
p249
aVin real time in front of our eyes.
p250
aVWhen you think about it,
p251
aVit is ironic that our current solution
p252
aVfor people with stressed amygdalae
p253
aVis to place them in an environment
p254
aVthat actually inhibits any chance of further growth.
p255
aVOf course, imprisonment is a necessary part
p256
aVof the criminal justice system
p257
aVand of protecting society.
p258
aVOur research does not suggest
p259
aVthat criminals should submit their MRI scans
p260
aVas evidence in court
p261
aVand get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala.
p262
aVThe evidence is actually the other way.
p263
aVBecause our brains are capable of change,
p264
aVwe need to take responsibility for our actions,
p265
aVand they need to take responsibility
p266
aVfor their rehabilitation.
p267
aVOne way such rehabilitation might work
p268
aVis through restorative justice programs.
p269
aVHere victims, if they choose to participate,
p270
aVand perpetrators meet face to face
p271
aVin safe, structured encounters,
p272
aVand the perpetrator is encouraged
p273
aVto take responsibility for their actions,
p274
aVand the victim plays an active role in the process.
p275
aVIn such a setting, the perpetrator can see,
p276
aVperhaps for the first time,
p277
aVthe victim as a real person
p278
aVwith thoughts and feelings and a genuine
p279
aVemotional response.
p280
aVThis stimulates the amygdala
p281
aVand may be a more effective rehabilitative practice
p282
aVthan simple incarceration.
p283
aVSuch programs won't work for everyone,
p284
aVbut for many, it could be a way
p285
aVto break the frozen sea within.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo what can we do now?
p288
aVHow can we apply this knowledge?
p289
aVI'd like to leave you with
p290
aVthree lessons that I learned.
p291
aVThe first thing that I learned was that
p292
aVwe need to change our mindset.
p293
aVSince Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,
p294
aVsociety has advanced in virtually every aspect,
p295
aVin the way we run our schools, our hospitals.
p296
aVYet the moment we speak about prisons,
p297
aVit's as though we're back in Dickensian times,
p298
aVif not medieval times.
p299
aVFor too long, I believe,
p300
aVwe've allowed ourselves to be persuaded
p301
aVof the false notion that human  nature cannot change,
p302
aVand as a society, it's costing us dearly.
p303
aVWe know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change,
p304
aVand the best way to achieve that,
p305
aVeven in adults, is to change and modulate
p306
aVour environment.
p307
aa(lp308
VThe second thing I have learned
p309
aVis that we need to create an alliance
p310
aVof people who believe that science is integral
p311
aVto bringing about social change.
p312
aVIt's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place
p313
aVa high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.
p314
aVWell actually, that turns out not to be so easy,
p315
aVbut ultimately what we want to show
p316
aVis whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates.
p317
aVIn order to answer complex questions like that,
p318
aVwe need people of different backgrounds \u2014
p319
aVlab-based scientists and clinicians,
p320
aVsocial workers and policy makers,
p321
aVphilanthropists and human rights activists \u2014
p322
aVto work together.
p323
aa(lp324
VFinally, I believe we need
p325
aVto change our own amygdalae,
p326
aVbecause this issue goes to the heart
p327
aVnot just of who Joe is,
p328
aVbut who we are.
p329
aVWe need to change our view of Joe
p330
aVas someone wholly irredeemable,
p331
aVbecause if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,
p332
aVhow is he going to see himself as any different?
p333
aVIn another decade, Joe will be released
p334
aVfrom Wormwood Scrubs.
p335
aVWill he be among the 70 percent of inmates
p336
aVwho end up reoffending
p337
aVand returning to the prison system?
p338
aVWouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,
p339
aVJoe was able to train his amygdala,
p340
aVwhich would stimulate the growth of new brain cells
p341
aVand connections,
p342
aVso that he will be able to face the world
p343
aVonce he gets released?
p344
aVSurely, that would be in the interest of all of us.
