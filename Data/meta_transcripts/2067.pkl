VTen years ago, I wrote a book which I entitled
p4
aV"Our Final Century?" Question mark.
p5
aVMy publishers cut out the question mark. (Laughter)
p6
aVThe American publishers changed our title
p7
aVto "Our Final Hour."
p8
aVAmericans like instant gratification and the reverse.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd my theme was this:
p12
aVOur Earth has existed for 45 million centuries,
p13
aVbut this one is special \u2014
p14
aVit's the first where one species, ours,
p15
aVhas the planet's future in its hands.
p16
aVOver nearly all of Earth's history,
p17
aVthreats have come from nature \u2014
p18
aVdisease, earthquakes, asteroids and so forth \u2014
p19
aVbut from now on, the worst dangers come from us.
p20
aVAnd it's now not just the nuclear threat;
p21
aVin our interconnected world,
p22
aVnetwork breakdowns can cascade globally;
p23
aVair travel can spread pandemics worldwide within days;
p24
aVand social media can spread panic and rumor
p25
aVliterally at the speed of light.
p26
aVWe fret too much about minor hazards \u2014
p27
aVimprobable air crashes, carcinogens in food,
p28
aVlow radiation doses, and so forth \u2014
p29
aVbut we and our political masters
p30
aVare in denial about catastrophic scenarios.
p31
aVThe worst have thankfully not yet happened.
p32
aVIndeed, they probably won't.
p33
aVBut if an event is potentially devastating,
p34
aVit's worth paying a substantial premium
p35
aVto safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely,
p36
aVjust as we take out fire insurance on our house.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd as science offers greater power and promise,
p39
aVthe downside gets scarier too.
p40
aVWe get ever more vulnerable.
p41
aVWithin a few decades,
p42
aVmillions will have the capability
p43
aVto misuse rapidly advancing biotech,
p44
aVjust as they misuse cybertech today.
p45
aVFreeman Dyson, in a TED Talk,
p46
aVforesaw that children will design and create new organisms
p47
aVjust as routinely as his generation played with chemistry sets.
p48
aVWell, this may be on the science fiction fringe,
p49
aVbut were even part of his scenario to come about,
p50
aVour ecology and even our species
p51
aVwould surely not survive long unscathed.
p52
aVFor instance, there are some eco-extremists
p53
aVwho think that it would be better for the planet,
p54
aVfor Gaia, if there were far fewer humans.
p55
aVWhat happens when such people have mastered
p56
aVsynthetic biology techniques
p57
aVthat will be widespread by 2050?
p58
aVAnd by then, other science fiction nightmares
p59
aVmay transition to reality:
p60
aVdumb robots going rogue,
p61
aVor a network that develops a mind of its own
p62
aVthreatens us all.
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, can we guard against such risks by regulation?
p65
aVWe must surely try, but these enterprises
p66
aVare so competitive, so globalized,
p67
aVand so driven by commercial pressure,
p68
aVthat anything that can be done will be done somewhere,
p69
aVwhatever the regulations say.
p70
aVIt's like the drug laws \u2014 we try to regulate, but can't.
p71
aVAnd the global village will have its village idiots,
p72
aVand they'll have a global range.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo as I said in my book,
p75
aVwe'll have a bumpy ride through this century.
p76
aVThere may be setbacks to our society \u2014
p77
aVindeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback.
p78
aVBut are there conceivable events
p79
aVthat could be even worse,
p80
aVevents that could snuff out all life?
p81
aVWhen a new particle accelerator came online,
p82
aVsome people anxiously asked,
p83
aVcould it destroy the Earth or, even worse,
p84
aVrip apart the fabric of space?
p85
aVWell luckily, reassurance could be offered.
p86
aVI and others pointed out that nature
p87
aVhas done the same experiments
p88
aVzillions of times already,
p89
aVvia cosmic ray collisions.
p90
aVBut scientists should surely be precautionary
p91
aVabout experiments that generate conditions
p92
aVwithout precedent in the natural world.
p93
aVBiologists should avoid release of potentially devastating
p94
aVgenetically modified pathogens.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd by the way, our special aversion
p97
aVto the risk of truly existential disasters
p98
aVdepends on a philosophical and ethical question,
p99
aVand it's this:
p100
aVConsider two scenarios.
p101
aVScenario A wipes out 90 percent of humanity.
p102
aVScenario B wipes out 100 percent.
p103
aVHow much worse is B than A?
p104
aVSome would say 10 percent worse.
p105
aVThe body count is 10 percent higher.
p106
aVBut I claim that B is incomparably worse.
p107
aVAs an astronomer, I can't believe
p108
aVthat humans are the end of the story.
p109
aVIt is five billion years before the sun flares up,
p110
aVand the universe may go on forever,
p111
aVso post-human evolution,
p112
aVhere on Earth and far beyond,
p113
aVcould be as prolonged as the Darwinian process
p114
aVthat's led to us, and even more wonderful.
p115
aVAnd indeed, future evolution will happen much faster,
p116
aVon a technological timescale,
p117
aVnot a natural selection timescale.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo we surely, in view of those immense stakes,
p120
aVshouldn't accept even a one in a billion risk
p121
aVthat human extinction would foreclose
p122
aVthis immense potential.
p123
aVSome scenarios that have been envisaged
p124
aVmay indeed be science fiction,
p125
aVbut others may be disquietingly real.
p126
aVIt's an important maxim that the unfamiliar
p127
aVis not the same as the improbable,
p128
aVand in fact, that's why we at Cambridge University
p129
aVare setting up a center to study how to mitigate
p130
aVthese existential risks.
p131
aVIt seems it's worthwhile just for a few people
p132
aVto think about these potential disasters.
p133
aVAnd we need all the help we can get from others,
p134
aVbecause we are stewards of a precious
p135
aVpale blue dot in a vast cosmos,
p136
aVa planet with 50 million centuries ahead of it.
p137
aVAnd so let's not jeopardize that future.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd I'd like to finish with a quote
p140
aVfrom a great scientist called Peter Medawar.
p141
aVI quote, "The bells that toll for mankind
p142
aVare like the bells of Alpine cattle.
p143
aVThey are attached to our own necks,
p144
aVand it must be our fault if they do not make
p145
aVa tuneful and melodious sound."
