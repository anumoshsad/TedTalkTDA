V"The Better Man."
p4
aa(lp5
VI was the better at getting and keeping.
p6
aa(lp7
VYou were the better at spend and spend;
p8
aa(lp9
VI was the better at grubbing and heaping,
p10
aa(lp11
VBut who was the better man in the end?
p12
aa(lp13
VYes, who was the better man, my friend?
p14
aa(lp15
VYou were the better with lords and ladies,
p16
aa(lp17
VI was the better at pillaging Troy;
p18
aa(lp19
VYou were the better at kissing the babies,
p20
aa(lp21
VI was the better at search and destroy.
p22
aa(lp23
VBut who was the better man, old boy?
p24
aa(lp25
VWho was the better man?
p26
aa(lp27
VI was the better at improvisation,
p28
aa(lp29
VYou were the better at spinning the plates;
p30
aa(lp31
VI was the better at procrastination,
p32
aa(lp33
VYou were the better at quiet debate.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut who was the better man, old mate?
p36
aa(lp37
VWho was the better man?
p38
aa(lp39
VYou were the better at rolling a reefer,
p40
aa(lp41
VI was the better at coke and rum;
p42
aa(lp43
VRemember that night on the beach in Ibiza?
p44
aa(lp45
VThe Maori twins
p46
aVwith the tattooed bum?
p47
aa(lp48
VBut who was the better man, old chum?
p49
aa(lp50
VWho was the better man?
p51
aa(lp52
VNow we come down to it, relatives grieving.
p53
aa(lp54
VOut in the hall with their crocodile tears;
p55
aa(lp56
VNow that you're out of it, now that you're leaving,
p57
aa(lp58
VNow that they've sealed your arse and your ears,
p59
aa(lp60
VWhat I've been meaning to tell you for years,
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd years, and years, and years, old friend ...
p63
aa(lp64
VIs that you were the better man, in the end;
p65
aa(lp66
VYou were the better man,
p67
aa(lp68
VMy friend.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Applause)
p71
aa(lp72
VI wrote this next poem for my mother.
p73
aVEvery one of us had a mother,
p74
aVonly one \u2014
p75
aVprobably the most important person in your life,
p76
aVif you're lucky enough to know them.
p77
aVMy mother was certainly the most important in mine.
p78
aVLet me try and describe her to you.
p79
aVShe's 86 years old. She's frail.
p80
aVWhite, platinum hair.
p81
aVWhy do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,
p82
aVand make those helmets?
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVBright as a button. All the ducks in a row.
p85
aVLooks like a much prettier version
p86
aVof Margaret Thatcher,
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVbut without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVI wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.
p91
aVBut my mother has lived by this creed
p92
aVall her life.
p93
aa(lp94
V"Never Go Back."
p95
aa(lp96
VNever go back. Never go back.
p97
aa(lp98
VNever return to the haunts of your youth.
p99
aa(lp100
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p101
aa(lp102
VMemory holds all you need of the truth.
p103
aa(lp104
VNever look back. Never look back.
p105
aa(lp106
VNever succumb to the gorgon's stare.
p107
aa(lp108
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p109
aa(lp110
VNo-one is waiting and nothing is there.
p111
aa(lp112
VNever go back. Never go back.
p113
aa(lp114
VNever surrender the future you earned.
p115
aa(lp116
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p117
aa(lp118
VNever return to the bridges you've burned.
p119
aa(lp120
VNever look back. Never look back.
p121
aa(lp122
VNever retreat to the 'glorious past.'
p123
aa(lp124
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p125
aa(lp126
VTreat every day of your life as your last.
p127
aa(lp128
VNever go back. Never go back.
p129
aa(lp130
VNever acknowledge the ghost on the stair.
p131
aa(lp132
VKeep to the track, to the beaten track;
p133
aa(lp134
VNo-one is waiting and nothing is there.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VNow ladies and gentlemen, I'm up on me hobbyhorse.
p139
aVIf every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon
p140
aVwere tied end to end along a railroad track,
p141
aVthat would be me,
p142
aVstoking the train
p143
aVwithout a qualm in the world.
p144
aVLadies, don't do it.
p145
aVDon't do it.
p146
aVYou think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.
p147
aVStop it.
p148
aVTell them to go to hell.
p149
aVYou bodies are wonderful as they are.
p150
aVJust leave them alone.
p151
aa(lp152
V"To a Beautiful Lady of a Certain Age."
p153
aa(lp154
VLady lady, do not weep.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat is gone is gone. Now sleep.
p157
aa(lp158
VTurn your pillow. Dry your tears.
p159
aa(lp160
VCount thy sheep and not thy years.
p161
aa(lp162
VNothing good can come of this.
p163
aa(lp164
VTime rules all, my dearest.
p165
aa(lp166
V'Tis but folly to be waging war
p167
aa(lp168
VOn one who never lost before.
p169
aa(lp170
VLady, this is all in vain.
p171
aa(lp172
VYouth can never come again;
p173
aa(lp174
VWe have drunk the summer wine.
p175
aa(lp176
VNone can make a stitch in time.
p177
aa(lp178
VNip and tuck till crack of doom.
p179
aa(lp180
VWhat is foretold in the womb
p181
aa(lp182
VMay not be foresworn with gold.
p183
aa(lp184
VNor may time be bought or sold.
p185
aa(lp186
VDearest, do I love thee less?
p187
aa(lp188
VDo I shrink from thy caress?
p189
aa(lp190
VThink you I could cease to care?
p191
aa(lp192
VNever was there one so fair!
p193
aa(lp194
VLady lady, do not weep \u2014
p195
aa(lp196
VWhat is gone is gone. Now sleep.
p197
aa(lp198
VLean against me, calm your fears,
p199
aa(lp200
VCount thy blessings, not thy years.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VAmerica, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain
p205
aVever has, or ever could have done.
p206
aVI was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.
p207
aVEven when on its worst behavior,
p208
aVI find myself automatically defending the USA
p209
aVfrom the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles
p210
aVplaying their Greek card to Roman trumps.
p211
aVAmerica is an empire.
p212
aVI hope you know that now.
p213
aVAll empires, by definition, are bumbling,
p214
aVshambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,
p215
aVas certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,
p216
aVas they are corrupted by power in their dotage.
p217
aVI am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.
p218
aVBut it seems to be that the USA's sins,
p219
aVcompared to those of many previous empires,
p220
aVare of a more moderate,
p221
aVif more pervasive, kind.
p222
aVLet me put this bluntly.
p223
aVIf Americans are so fat,
p224
aVstupid and ignorant,
p225
aVmy dear friends from Birmingham,
p226
aVhow come they rule the world?
p227
aa(lp228
V"Hail to the Gods of America."
p229
aa(lp230
VHail to the Gods of America!
p231
aa(lp232
VHail to the gods of the dream.
p233
aa(lp234
VInvictus E Pluribus Unum.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut which of them reigns supreme?
p237
aa(lp238
VWhich is America's Jupiter?
p239
aa(lp240
VThe Brahmins of Capital Hill?
p241
aa(lp242
VA sorcerer's profit on Wall Street?
p243
aa(lp244
VThey eye of a dollar bill?
p245
aa(lp246
VOr is it celebrity status?
p247
aa(lp248
VThe worship of those we hate.
p249
aa(lp250
VOr the cult of living forever,
p251
aa(lp252
VIf only we'd watch our weight.
p253
aa(lp254
VWhat of the titans of media?
p255
aa(lp256
VOr Hollywood's siren call?
p257
aa(lp258
VWhat of the temples of justice,
p259
aa(lp260
VWhose servants enslave us all?
p261
aa(lp262
VWhat of the Brand and the Label?
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat of the upstart Sport?
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd what of the Constitution,
p267
aa(lp268
VThat bully of last resort?
p269
aa(lp270
VHail to the God of America,
p271
aa(lp272
VWhose power the masses extol \u2014
p273
aa(lp274
VConvenience rules America;
p275
aa(lp276
VConvenience owns our soul.
p277
aa(lp278
VAye, that it does.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd if you would like to know why I am not a father \u2014
p283
aVI, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren \u2014
p284
aVthe answer is in this poem,
p285
aVwhich upsets me every time I read it.
p286
aa(lp287
V"Love Came to Visit Me."
p288
aa(lp289
VLove came to visit me,
p290
aVshy as a fawn.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut finding me busy,
p293
aVshe fled, with the dawn.
p294
aa(lp295
VAt 20 the torch of resentment was lit.
p296
aa(lp297
VMy rage at injustice
p298
aVwaxed hot as the pits.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe flux of its lava cleared all in its path.
p301
aa(lp302
VComrades and enemies fled from its wrath.
p303
aa(lp304
VYet lovers grew wary, once novelty waned
p305
aa(lp306
VTo lie with a bloody man,
p307
aVhis terror unfeigned.
p308
aa(lp309
VAt 30 my powers seemed mighty to me.
p310
aa(lp311
VThe fruits of my rivals, I shook from the tree.
p312
aa(lp313
VBy guile and by bluster,
p314
aVby night and by day,
p315
aa(lp316
VI battered and scattered the fools from my way.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd women grew willing to sham and to bluff.
p319
aa(lp320
VTheir trinkets and baubles cost little enough.
p321
aa(lp322
VFrom 40 to 50, grown easy and sly,
p323
aa(lp324
VI wined them and dined them, like pigs in a sty.
p325
aa(lp326
VWe feasted and reveled and rutted in muck,
p327
aa(lp328
VForgetting our peril, forgetting to duck,
p329
aa(lp330
VForgetting times arrows are sharper than knives.
p331
aa(lp332
VGrown sick to our stomachs,
p333
aVand sick of our lives.
p334
aa(lp335
VLove came to visit me,
p336
aVshy as a fawn.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut finding me busy,
p339
aVshe fled with the dawn.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VUm, there are \u2014
p344
aVI've got far too much money and I have far too much fun
p345
aVin my businesses.
p346
aVSo poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.
p347
aVA complete shock. I was a little ill.
p348
aVOkay, I was ill.
p349
aVOkay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.
p350
aVI was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.
p351
aVI wasn't allowed to see any of my \u2014 you know, whatever.
p352
aVSo, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.
p353
aVAnd from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.
p354
aVAnd I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.
p355
aVThat was in October of 2000.
p356
aa(lp357
VI'm not an evil man.
p358
aVBut sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.
p359
aVI'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,
p360
aVwho men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.
p361
aVBut sometimes I try to put myself in that position.
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVNot with much success.
p364
aVBut it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.
p365
aVI love to think what they thought, what it was like.
p366
aa(lp367
VBecause although
p368
aVmany of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,
p369
aValthough you guys can not only go to the moon,
p370
aVyou know, you're going to totally transform everything.
p371
aVCloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.
p372
aVI don't know. You can do anything you want.
p373
aVAll you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!
p374
aa(lp375
VBut human nature doesn't change, mate.
p376
aVMy friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was
p377
aVwhen my ancestor \u2014
p378
aVprobably it was my ancestor \u2014
p379
aVgot his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,
p380
aVand battered the bastard to death.
p381
aVYou think we didn't do that?
p382
aVOh, we did.
p383
aVWe killed every single one of them.
p384
aVInch by inch we killed them.
p385
aVWe hunted them down wherever they were.
p386
aVRivals for meat. Rivals for berries.
p387
aVWe're still doing it,
p388
aVwith all of the genius assembled in this room.
p389
aVOur natures haven't changed a single iota.
p390
aVAnd they never will.
p391
aVEven when we've got off this little planet,
p392
aVand have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd I am as bad as you.
p395
aVI spent eight years
p396
aVrunning one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.
p397
aVAnd at seven o'clock every night,
p398
aVI took me some more girls, already corrupted.
p399
aVI never did anything to anyone that wasn't.
p400
aVAnd I took crack cocaine,
p401
aVevery single night for seven years.
p402
aVIt was like Dante's "Inferno."
p403
aVIt was unbelievable.
p404
aVOne of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection
p405
aVfor about four hours.
p406
aVAnd you stay up for 12.
p407
aVIt was absolutely unbelievable.
p408
aVTwenty-two godchildren I've got.
p409
aVWhat do I say to them?
p410
aVI only stopped because I thought if I got caught,
p411
aVwhat would happen to my mother.
p412
aVIf you're a woman, remember that.
p413
aVThe love of your son
p414
aVcan utterly transform anything he does.
p415
aa(lp416
V"Our Lady in White."
p417
aa(lp418
VPale she was, listless;
p419
aa(lp420
VAnd soft to the touch.
p421
aa(lp422
VA generous mistress Whom many loved much.
p423
aa(lp424
VShoulder to shoulder, Night after night,
p425
aa(lp426
VWe hoarded and sold her \u2014
p427
aa(lp428
VOur Lady in White.
p429
aa(lp430
VWe breathed but to savor
p431
aVher crystal caress.
p432
aa(lp433
VWe craved but to favor the hem of her dress.
p434
aa(lp435
VWe dabbled and babbled,
p436
aVDenying our thirsts.
p437
aa(lp438
VBut always we scrabbled
p439
aVto lie with her first.
p440
aa(lp441
VAbsent, we missed her,
p442
aVgrew haggard and limp.
p443
aa(lp444
VToyed with her sister,
p445
aVor threatened her pimp.
p446
aa(lp447
VCame word out of Babel, the lady returns!
p448
aa(lp449
VAnd there on the table we took her, in turns.
p450
aa(lp451
VSensing the power that tyranny craves,
p452
aa(lp453
VThere in that hour, she made us her slaves.
p454
aa(lp455
VMany there were, to covet her kiss.
p456
aa(lp457
VMy shame as a spur,
p458
aVI fled the abyss.
p459
aa(lp460
VBut only just.
