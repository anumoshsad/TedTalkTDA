VThe story starts in Kenya
p4
aVin December of 2007,
p5
aVwhen there was a disputed presidential election,
p6
aVand in the immediate aftermath of that election,
p7
aVthere was an outbreak of ethnic violence.
p8
aVAnd there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh \u2014
p9
aVwho some of you may know from her TEDTalk \u2014
p10
aVwho began blogging about it on her site,
p11
aVKenyan Pundit.
p12
aVAnd shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,
p13
aVthe government suddenly imposed
p14
aVa significant media blackout.
p15
aVAnd so weblogs went from being
p16
aVcommentary as part of the media landscape
p17
aVto being a critical part of the media landscape
p18
aVin trying to understand where the violence was.
p19
aVAnd Okolloh solicited
p20
aVfrom her commenters
p21
aVmore information about what was going on.
p22
aVThe comments began pouring in,
p23
aVand Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.
p24
aVAnd she quickly said, "It's too much.
p25
aVI could do this all day every day
p26
aVand I can't keep up.
p27
aVThere is more information
p28
aVabout what's going on in Kenya right now
p29
aVthan any one person can manage.
p30
aVIf only there was a way to automate this."
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd two programmers who read her blog
p33
aVheld their hands up and said, "We could do that,"
p34
aVand in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.
p35
aVUshahidi \u2014 the name means "witness"
p36
aVor "testimony" in Swahili \u2014
p37
aVis a very simple way of taking reports from the field,
p38
aVwhether it's from the web or, critically,
p39
aVvia mobile phones and SMS,
p40
aVaggregating it and putting it on a map.
p41
aVThat's all it is, but that's all that's needed
p42
aVbecause what it does is it takes the tacit information
p43
aVavailable to the whole population \u2014
p44
aVeverybody knows where the violence is,
p45
aVbut no one person knows what everyone knows \u2014
p46
aVand it takes that tacit information
p47
aVand it aggregates it,
p48
aVand it maps it and it makes it public.
p49
aVAnd that, that maneuver
p50
aVcalled "crisis mapping,"
p51
aVwas kicked off in Kenya
p52
aVin January of 2008.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough
p55
aVthat the programmers who created Ushahidi
p56
aVdecided they were going to make it open source
p57
aVand turn it into a platform.
p58
aVIt's since been deployed in Mexico
p59
aVto track electoral fraud.
p60
aVIt's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.
p61
aVAnd it's been used most famously in Haiti
p62
aVin the aftermath of the earthquake.
p63
aVAnd when you look at the map
p64
aVnow posted on the Ushahidi front page,
p65
aVyou can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi
p66
aVhas gone worldwide, all right?
p67
aVThis went from a single idea
p68
aVand a single implementation
p69
aVin East Africa in the beginning of 2008
p70
aVto a global deployment
p71
aVin less than three years.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow what Okolloh did
p74
aVwould not have been possible
p75
aVwithout digital technology.
p76
aVWhat Okolloh did would not have been possible
p77
aVwithout human generosity.
p78
aVAnd the interesting moment now,
p79
aVthe number of environments
p80
aVwhere the social design challenge
p81
aVrelies on both of those things being true.
p82
aVThat is the resource that I'm talking about.
p83
aVI call it cognitive surplus.
p84
aVAnd it represents the ability
p85
aVof the world's population
p86
aVto volunteer and to contribute and collaborate
p87
aVon large, sometimes global, projects.
p88
aVCognitive surplus is made up of two things.
p89
aVThe first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.
p90
aVThe world has over
p91
aVa trillion hours a year
p92
aVof free time
p93
aVto commit to shared projects.
p94
aVNow, that free time existed in the 20th century,
p95
aVbut we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.
p96
aa(lp97
VThat's the second half of cognitive surplus.
p98
aVThe media landscape in the 20th century
p99
aVwas very good at helping people consume,
p100
aVand we got, as a result,
p101
aVvery good at consuming.
p102
aVBut now that we've been given media tools \u2014
p103
aVthe Internet, mobile phones \u2014 that let us do more than consume,
p104
aVwhat we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes
p105
aVbecause we liked to be.
p106
aVWe were couch potatoes because that was
p107
aVthe only opportunity given to us.
p108
aVWe still like to consume, of course.
p109
aVBut it turns out we also like to create,
p110
aVand we like to share.
p111
aVAnd it's those two things together \u2014
p112
aVancient human motivation
p113
aVand the modern tools to allow that motivation
p114
aVto be joined up in large-scale efforts \u2014
p115
aVthat are the new design resource.
p116
aVAnd using cognitive surplus,
p117
aVwe're starting to see truly incredible experiments
p118
aVin scientific, literary,
p119
aVartistic, political efforts.
p120
aVDesigning.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.
p123
aVLOLcats are cute pictures of cats
p124
aVmade cuter with the addition of cute captions.
p125
aVAnd they are also
p126
aVpart of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
p127
aVThis is one of the participatory \u2014
p128
aVone of the participatory models
p129
aVwe see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.
p130
aVNow I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,
p131
aVthat LOLcats are the stupidest possible
p132
aVcreative act.
p133
aVThere are other candidates of course,
p134
aVbut LOLcats will do as a general case.
p135
aVBut here's the thing:
p136
aVThe stupidest possible creative act
p137
aVis still a creative act.
p138
aVSomeone who has done something like this,
p139
aVhowever mediocre and throwaway,
p140
aVhas tried something, has put something forward in public.
p141
aVAnd once they've done it, they can do it again,
p142
aVand they could work on getting it better.
p143
aa(lp144
VThere is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,
p145
aVand as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,
p146
aVit's a spectrum you're constantly
p147
aVstruggling to get on top of.
p148
aVThe gap is between
p149
aVdoing anything and doing nothing.
p150
aVAnd someone who makes a LOLcat
p151
aVhas already crossed over that gap.
p152
aVNow it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis
p153
aVwithout the LOLcats, right,
p154
aVto get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.
p155
aVBut media abundance never works that way.
p156
aVFreedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.
p157
aVEven with the sacred printing press,
p158
aVwe got erotic novels 150 years
p159
aVbefore we got scientific journals.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo before I talk about
p162
aVwhat is, I think, the critical difference
p163
aVbetween LOLcats and Ushahidi,
p164
aVI want to talk about
p165
aVtheir shared source.
p166
aVAnd that source is design for generosity.
p167
aVIt is one of the curiosities of our historical era
p168
aVthat even as cognitive surplus
p169
aVis becoming a resource we can design around,
p170
aVsocial sciences are also starting to explain
p171
aVhow important
p172
aVour intrinsic motivations are to us,
p173
aVhow much we do things because we like to do them
p174
aVrather than because our boss told us to do them,
p175
aVor because we're being paid to do them.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis is a graph from a paper
p178
aVby Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,
p179
aVwho set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,
p180
aVwhat they called "deterrence theory."
p181
aVAnd deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:
p182
aVIf you want somebody to do less of something,
p183
aVadd a punishment and they'll do less of it.
p184
aVSimple, straightforward, commonsensical \u2014
p185
aValso, largely untested.
p186
aVAnd so they went and studied
p187
aV10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.
p188
aVThey studied those daycare centers
p189
aVat the time of highest tension,
p190
aVwhich is pick-up time.
p191
aVAt pick-up time the teachers,
p192
aVwho have been with your children all day,
p193
aVwould like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.
p194
aVMeanwhile, the parents \u2014 perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands \u2014
p195
aVwant a little slack to pick the kids up late.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo Gneezy and Rustichini said,
p198
aV"How many instances of late pick-ups
p199
aVare there at these 10 daycare centers?"
p200
aVNow they saw \u2014 and this is what the graph is,
p201
aVthese are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals \u2014
p202
aVthat there were between six and 10
p203
aVinstances of late pick-ups
p204
aVon average in these 10 daycare centers.
p205
aVSo they divided the daycare centers into two groups.
p206
aVThe white group there
p207
aVis the control group; they change nothing.
p208
aVBut the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,
p209
aVthey said, "We are changing this bargain
p210
aVas of right now.
p211
aVIf you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,
p212
aVwe're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.
p213
aVBoom. No ifs, ands or buts."
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd the minute they did that,
p216
aVthe behavior in those daycare centers changed.
p217
aVLate pick-ups went up
p218
aVevery week for the next four weeks
p219
aVuntil they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,
p220
aVand then they fluctuated
p221
aVat between double and triple the pre-fine average
p222
aVfor the life of the fine.
p223
aVAnd you can see immediately what happened, right?
p224
aVThe fine broke the culture
p225
aVof the daycare center.
p226
aVBy adding a fine,
p227
aVwhat they did was communicate to the parents
p228
aVthat their entire debt to the teachers
p229
aVhad been discharged
p230
aVwith the payment of 10 shekels,
p231
aVand that there was no residue of guilt or social concern
p232
aVthat the parents owed the teachers.
p233
aVAnd so the parents, quite sensibly, said,
p234
aV"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?
p235
aVWhat could be bad?"
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VThe explanation of human behavior
p239
aVthat we inherited in the 20th century
p240
aVwas that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,
p241
aVand in that explanation \u2014
p242
aVthe daycare center had no contract \u2014
p243
aVshould have been operating without any constraints.
p244
aVBut that's not right.
p245
aVThey were operating with social constraints
p246
aVrather than contractual ones.
p247
aVAnd critically, the social constraints
p248
aVcreated a culture that was more generous
p249
aVthan the contractual constraints did.
p250
aVSo Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks \u2014
p251
aVrun the fine for a dozen weeks \u2014
p252
aVand then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."
p253
aVAnd then a really interesting thing happens:
p254
aVNothing changes.
p255
aVThe culture that got broken by the fine
p256
aVstayed broken when the fine was removed.
p257
aVNot only are economic motivations
p258
aVand intrinsic motivations
p259
aVincompatible,
p260
aVthat incompatibility
p261
aVcan persist over long periods.
p262
aVSo the trick
p263
aVin designing these kinds of situations
p264
aVis to understand where you're relying on
p265
aVthe economic part of the bargain \u2014 as with the parents paying the teachers \u2014
p266
aVand when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,
p267
aVwhen you're really designing for generosity.
p268
aa(lp269
VThis brings me back to the LOLcats
p270
aVand to Ushahidi.
p271
aVThis is, I think, the range that matters.
p272
aVBoth of these rely on cognitive surplus.
p273
aVBoth of these design for the assumption
p274
aVthat people like to create and we want to share.
p275
aVHere is the critical difference between these:
p276
aVLOLcats is communal value.
p277
aVIt's value created by the participants
p278
aVfor each other.
p279
aVCommunal value on the networks we have
p280
aVis everywhere \u2014
p281
aVevery time you see a large aggregate
p282
aVof shared, publicly available data,
p283
aVwhether it's photos on Flickr
p284
aVor videos on Youtube or whatever.
p285
aVThis is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,
p286
aVmaybe a little more even,
p287
aVbut this is also
p288
aVa largely solved problem.
p289
aVI have a hard time envisioning a future
p290
aVin which someone is saying,
p291
aV"Where, oh where, can I find a picture
p292
aVof a cute cat?"
p293
aa(lp294
VUshahidi, by contrast,
p295
aVis civic value.
p296
aVIt's value created by the participants
p297
aVbut enjoyed by society as a whole.
p298
aVThe goals set out by Ushahidi
p299
aVare not just to make life better
p300
aVfor the participants,
p301
aVbut to make life better for everyone in the society
p302
aVin which Ushahidi is operating.
p303
aVAnd that kind of civic value
p304
aVis not just a side effect
p305
aVof opening up to human motivation.
p306
aVIt really is going to be a side effect
p307
aVof what we, collectively,
p308
aVmake of these kinds of efforts.
p309
aVThere are a trillion
p310
aVhours a year
p311
aVof participatory value
p312
aVup for grabs.
p313
aVThat will be true year-in and year-out.
p314
aVThe number of people who are going to be able
p315
aVto participate in these kinds of projects
p316
aVis going to grow,
p317
aVand we can see that organizations
p318
aVdesigned around a culture of generosity
p319
aVcan achieve incredible effects
p320
aVwithout an enormous amount of contractual overhead \u2014
p321
aVa very different model
p322
aVthan our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.
p323
aa(lp324
VWhat's going to make the difference here
p325
aVis what Dean Kamen said,
p326
aVthe inventor and entrepreneur.
p327
aVKamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."
p328
aVWe've got a choice before us.
p329
aVWe've got this trillion hours a year.
p330
aVWe can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.
p331
aVThat, we get for free.
p332
aVBut we can also celebrate
p333
aVand support and reward the people
p334
aVtrying to use cognitive surplus
p335
aVto create civic value.
p336
aVAnd to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,
p337
aVwe'll be able to change society.
