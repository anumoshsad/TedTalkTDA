VOnce upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
p4
aVIt was run by the great and powerful parents,
p5
aVand the people were helpless
p6
aVand hopeless naughty children.
p7
aVIf any of the more rowdier children questioned
p8
aVthe authority of the parents, they were scolded.
p9
aVIf they went exploring into the parents' rooms,
p10
aVor even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,
p11
aVand told that for their own good
p12
aVthey must never go in there again.
p13
aa(lp14
VThen one day, a man came to town
p15
aVwith boxes and boxes of secret documents
p16
aVstolen from the parents' rooms.
p17
aV"Look what they've been hiding from you," he said.
p18
aVThe children looked and were amazed.
p19
aVThere were maps and minutes from meetings
p20
aVwhere the parents were slagging each other off.
p21
aVThey behaved just like the children.
p22
aVAnd they made mistakes, too, just like the children.
p23
aVThe only difference was, their mistakes
p24
aVwere in the secret filing cabinets.
p25
aVWell, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think
p26
aVthey should be in the secret filing cabinets,
p27
aVor if they were, there ought to be a law
p28
aVto allow the children access.
p29
aVAnd so she set about to make it so.
p30
aa(lp31
VWell, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents
p32
aVthat I was interested in were located in this building,
p33
aVthe British Parliament, and the data that I wanted
p34
aVto get my hands on were the expense receipts
p35
aVof members of Parliament.
p36
aVI thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)
p37
aVIt wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,
p38
aVor anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got
p39
aVfrom this Freedom of Information request,
p40
aVyou would have thought I'd asked something like this.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo I fought for about five years doing this,
p43
aVand it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,
p44
aVnot \u2014 I didn't \u2014 Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,
p45
aVto revolutionize the British Parliament.
p46
aVThat was not my intention. I was just making these requests
p47
aVas part of research for my first book.
p48
aVBut it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle
p49
aVand there I was after five years fighting against Parliament
p50
aVin front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges
p51
aVwaiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
p52
aVAnd I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,
p53
aVbecause I'd seen the establishment. I thought,
p54
aVit always sticks together. I am out of luck.
p55
aa(lp56
VWell, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VWell, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was
p59
aVthat Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,
p60
aVand then they tried to retrospectively change the law
p61
aVso that it would no longer apply to them.
p62
aVThe transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,
p63
aVthey tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.
p64
aVWhat they hadn't counted on was digitization,
p65
aVbecause that meant that all those paper receipts
p66
aVhad been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy
p67
aVfor somebody to just copy that entire database,
p68
aVput it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,
p69
aVwhich they did, and then they shopped that disk
p70
aVto the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,
p71
aVand then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks
p72
aVof revelations, everything from porn movies
p73
aVand bath plugs and new kitchens
p74
aVand mortgages that had never been paid off.
p75
aVThe end result was six ministers resigned,
p76
aVthe first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,
p77
aVa new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,
p78
aV120 MPs stepped down at that election,
p79
aVand so far, four MPs and two lords
p80
aVhave done jail time for fraud.
p81
aVSo, thank you. (Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VWell, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
p84
aVIt was an example of a culture clash that's happening
p85
aVall over the world between bewigged and bestockinged
p86
aVofficials who think that they can rule over us
p87
aVwithout very much prying from the public,
p88
aVand then suddenly confronted with a public
p89
aVwho is no longer content with that arrangement,
p90
aVand not only not content with it, now, more often,
p91
aVarmed with official data itself.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we are moving to this democratization of information,
p94
aVand I've been in this field for quite a while.
p95
aVSlightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,
p96
aVI used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,
p97
aVsee what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
p98
aVI think that was a pretty good indication
p99
aVabout my future career as an investigative journalist,
p100
aVand what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long
p101
aVis that it used to be quite a niche interest,
p102
aVand it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,
p103
aVwants to know about what people in power are doing.
p104
aVThey want a say in decisions that are made in their name
p105
aVand with their money. It's this democratization of information
p106
aVthat I think is an information enlightenment,
p107
aVand it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
p108
aVIt's about searching for the truth,
p109
aVnot because somebody says it's true, "because I say so."
p110
aVNo, it's about trying to find the truth based on
p111
aVwhat you can see and what can be tested.
p112
aVThat, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about
p113
aVthe right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,
p114
aVor that women should be subordinate to men,
p115
aVor that the Church was the official word of God.
p116
aa(lp117
VObviously the Church weren't very happy about this,
p118
aVand they tried to suppress it,
p119
aVbut what they hadn't counted on was technology,
p120
aVand then they had the printing press, which suddenly
p121
aVenabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,
p122
aVand people would come together in coffee houses,
p123
aVdiscuss the ideas, plot revolution.
p124
aa(lp125
VIn our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,
p126
aVso now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.
p127
aVOur printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.
p128
aVWe're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,
p129
aVand we have global decisions to make in this system,
p130
aVdecisions about climate, about finance systems,
p131
aVabout resources. And think about it \u2014
p132
aVif we want to make an important decision about buying a house,
p133
aVwe don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,
p134
aVbut I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.
p135
aVAnd if we're thinking about a finance system,
p136
aVwe need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible
p137
aVfor one person to take in the amount, the volume
p138
aVof information, and analyze it to make good decisions.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand
p141
aVfor access to information.
p142
aVThat's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws
p143
aVcome out, so for example, on the environment,
p144
aVthere's the Aarhus Convention,
p145
aVwhich is a European directive that gives people
p146
aVa very strong right to know, so if your water company
p147
aVis dumping water into your river, sewage water
p148
aVinto your river, you have a right to know about it.
p149
aVIn the finance industry, you now have more of a right
p150
aVto know about what's going on, so we have
p151
aVdifferent anti-bribery laws, money regulations,
p152
aVincreased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.
p153
aVAnd it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,
p154
aVpay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out
p155
aVmore and more about these systems.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd they're all moving to this central system,
p158
aVthis fully connected system,
p159
aVall of them except one. Can you guess which one?
p160
aVIt's the system which underpins all these other systems.
p161
aVIt's the system by which we organize and exercise power,
p162
aVand there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,
p163
aVwe're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.
p164
aVAnd how is it possible that the volume of information
p165
aVcan be processed that needs to in this system?
p166
aVWell, it just can't. That's it.
p167
aVAnd I think this is largely what's behind the crisis
p168
aVof legitimacy in our different governments right now.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo I've told you a bit about what I did
p171
aVto try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,
p172
aVinto the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you
p173
aVa couple of examples of what a few other people I know
p174
aVare doing.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer
p177
aVprogrammer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,
p178
aVand what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.
p179
aVIt's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you
p180
aVto make a Freedom of Information request,
p181
aVto ask your public body a question, so
p182
aVit takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you
p183
aVthat there is a lot of hassle making these requests,
p184
aVso it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,
p185
aVfor example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
p186
aVIt zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you
p187
aVwhen the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all
p188
aVthe correspondence, it posts it up there,
p189
aVand it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
p190
aVSo that's open-source and it can be used in any country
p191
aVwhere there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.
p192
aVSo there's a list there of the different countries that have it,
p193
aVand then there's a few more coming on board.
p194
aVSo if any of you out there like the sound of that
p195
aVand have a law like that in your country,
p196
aVI know that Seb would love to hear from you
p197
aVabout collaborating and getting that into your country.
p198
aa(lp199
VThis is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.
p200
aVAnd quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was
p201
aVone of the protesters who was outside of Parliament
p202
aVwhen the country's economy collapsed,
p203
aVand then she was elected on a reform mandate,
p204
aVand she's now spearheading this project.
p205
aVIt's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,
p206
aVand they've just got funding to make it an international
p207
aVmodern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws
p208
aVaround the world about freedom of expression,
p209
aVprotection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,
p210
aVsource protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
p211
aVIt's a place where your data can be free, so when we think
p212
aVabout, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,
p213
aVwhat they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven
p214
aVwhere it can happen.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn my own field of investigative journalism, we're also
p217
aVhaving to start thinking globally, so this is a site called
p218
aVInvestigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track
p219
aVa dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,
p220
aVyou know, he's just funneling out cash from his country
p221
aVwhen he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do
p222
aVto investigate that is, you need to have access to
p223
aVall of the world's, as many as you can,
p224
aVcompanies' house registrations databases.
p225
aVSo this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those
p226
aVdatabases into one place so you can start searching for,
p227
aVyou know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
p228
aVYou can try and find out how he's moving out assets
p229
aVfrom that country.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut again, when it comes to the decisions which are
p232
aVimpacting us the most, perhaps, the most important
p233
aVdecisions that are being made about war and so forth,
p234
aVagain we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.
p235
aVIt's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on
p236
aVillegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.
p237
aVSo when the Guardian did this investigation about
p238
aVthe Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into
p239
aVthe Department of Defense and ask for all the information.
p240
aVYou know, they're just not going to get it.
p241
aVSo this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches
p242
aVthat were written by American soldiers
p243
aVabout the Afghan War, and leaked,
p244
aVand then they're able to do this investigation.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnother rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.
p247
aVAgain, this is all based around leaks,
p248
aV251,000 U.S. diplomatic cables, and I was involved
p249
aVin this investigation because I got this leak
p250
aVthrough a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker
p251
aVand ended up going to work at the Guardian.
p252
aVSo I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access
p253
aVto this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
p254
aVIt reminded me of that scene in "The Wizard of Oz."
p255
aVDo you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto
p256
aVruns across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,
p257
aVthe dog's pulling back the curtain, and \u2014
p258
aV"Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."
p259
aVIt was just like that, because what you started to see
p260
aVis that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous
p261
aVpoliticians, they were just like us.
p262
aVThey all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,
p263
aVthose cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important
p264
aVpoint for all of us to grasp, these are human beings
p265
aVjust like us. They don't have special powers.
p266
aVThey're not magic. They are not our parents.
p267
aVBeyond that, what I found most fascinating
p268
aVwas the level of endemic corruption that I saw
p269
aVacross all different countries, and particularly centered
p270
aVaround the heart of power, around public officials
p271
aVwho were embezzling the public's money
p272
aVfor their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that
p273
aVbecause of official secrecy.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be
p276
aVmore open than publishing all the material?
p277
aVBecause that is what Julian Assange did.
p278
aVHe wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it
p279
aVto be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
p280
aVThat did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan
p281
aVbeing exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator
p282
aVwas given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners
p283
aVin that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.
p284
aVIs that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,
p285
aVwhat it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,
p286
aVresponsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner
p287
aVwith power. It's about sharing responsibility,
p288
aVsharing accountability. Also, the fact that
p289
aVhe threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,
p290
aVI thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency
p291
aVin ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)
p292
aa(lp293
VThe other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,
p294
aVand you must have two real qualities, I think,
p295
aVwhen you come to the table, when you're dealing
p296
aVwith power, talking about power,
p297
aVbecause of its seductive capacity.
p298
aVYou've got to have skepticism and humility.
p299
aVSkepticism, because you must always be challenging.
p300
aVI want to see why do you \u2014 you just say so? That's not good enough.
p301
aVI want to see the evidence behind why that's so.
p302
aVAnd humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.
p303
aVAnd if you don't have skepticism and humility,
p304
aVthen it's a really short journey to go from reformer
p305
aVto autocrat, and I think you only have to read "Animal Farm"
p306
aVto get that message about how power corrupts people.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody
p309
aVwithin the rule of law rights to information.
p310
aVAt the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
p311
aVIn a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,
p312
aVincluding in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act
p313
aVwith no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,
p314
aVpeople are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,
p315
aVfor publishing or giving away official information.
p316
aVNow wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want
p317
aVall of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act
p318
aVwhere officials were punished if they were found
p319
aVto have suppressed or hidden information
p320
aVthat was in the public interest?
p321
aVSo that \u2014 yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)
p322
aVI would like us to work towards that.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is
p325
aVprogress on the line, but I think what we find is that
p326
aVthe closer that we get right into the heart of power,
p327
aVthe more opaque, closed it becomes.
p328
aVSo it was only just the other week that I heard London's
p329
aVMetropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why
p330
aVthe police need access to all of our communications,
p331
aVspying on us without any judicial oversight,
p332
aVand he said it was a matter of life and death.
p333
aVHe actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
p334
aVThere was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.
p335
aVIt was just, "Because I say so.
p336
aVYou have to trust me. Take it on faith."
p337
aVWell, I'm sorry, people, but we are back
p338
aVto the pre-Enlightenment Church,
p339
aVand we need to fight against that.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo he was talking about the law in Britain which is
p342
aVthe Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
p343
aVIn America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
p344
aVYou've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.
p345
aVYou have the National Security Agency building
p346
aVthe world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal \u2014
p347
aVit's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,
p348
aVin which they're going to intercept and analyze
p349
aVcommunications, traffic and personal data
p350
aVto try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.
p351
aa(lp352
VWell, to go back to our original story, the parents
p353
aVhave panicked. They've locked all the doors.
p354
aVThey've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras.
p355
aVThey're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,
p356
aVand they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms
p357
aVand figure out which ones of us are troublesome,
p358
aVand if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.
p359
aVWell, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
p360
aVSome fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
p361
aVI think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,
p362
aVindeed, very grim.
p363
aVBut the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal
p364
aVthan we want to acknowledge.
p365
aVEqually, it could be better than we've been led to believe,
p366
aVbut either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,
p367
aVwith all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it
p368
aVwith all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them
p369
aVand live in a world in which we can all be
p370
aVhappily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.

p372
aVThank you. (Applause)
