VSo how many of you have ever been in a cave before?
p4
aVOkay, a few of you.
p5
aVWhen you think of a cave, most of you think
p6
aVof a tunnel going through solid rock,
p7
aVand in fact, that's how most caves are.
p8
aVAround this half of the country,
p9
aVmost of your caves are made of limestone.
p10
aVBack where I'm from, most of our  caves are made of lava rock,
p11
aVbecause we have a lot of volcanoes out there.
p12
aVBut the caves I want to share  with you today are made
p13
aVcompletely of ice, specifically glacier ice
p14
aVthat's formed in the side of the tallest mountain
p15
aVin the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow Mount Hood's only  one hour's drive from Portland,
p18
aVthe largest city in Oregon,
p19
aVwhere over two million people live.
p20
aVNow the most exciting thing for a cave explorer
p21
aVis to find a new cave
p22
aVand be the first human to ever go into it.
p23
aVThe second most exciting thing for a cave explorer
p24
aVis to be the first one to make a map of a cave.
p25
aVNow these days, with so many people hiking around,
p26
aVit's pretty hard to find a new cave,
p27
aVso you can imagine how excited we were
p28
aVto find three new caves
p29
aVwithin sight of Oregon's largest city
p30
aVand realize that they had never been explored
p31
aVor mapped before.
p32
aVIt was kind of like being an astronaut,
p33
aVbecause we were getting to see things and go places
p34
aVthat no one had ever seen or gone to before.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo what is a glacier?
p37
aVWell, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow,
p38
aVyou know that it's really light,
p39
aVbecause it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.
p40
aVIf you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,
p41
aVit gets really small, hard and dense.
p42
aVWell, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows
p43
aVover 20 feet a year,
p44
aVit crushes the air out of it
p45
aVand gradually forms it into hard blue ice.
p46
aVNow each year, more and more ice stacks up on top of it,
p47
aVand eventually it gets so heavy
p48
aVthat it starts to slide down the mountain
p49
aVunder its own weight,
p50
aVforming a slow-moving river of ice.
p51
aVWhen ice packed like that starts to move,
p52
aVwe call it a glacier, and we give it a name.
p53
aVThe name of the glacier these caves are formed in
p54
aVis the Sandy Glacier.
p55
aVNow each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,
p56
aVit melts in the summer sun,
p57
aVand it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice,
p58
aVand they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier,
p59
aVforming big networks of caves,
p60
aVsometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock.
p61
aVNow the crazy thing about glacier caves
p62
aVis that each year, new tunnels form.
p63
aVDifferent waterfalls pop up or move around
p64
aVfrom place to place inside the cave.
p65
aVWarm water from the top of the ice
p66
aVis boring its way down,
p67
aVand warm air from below the mountain
p68
aVactually rises up, gets into the cave,
p69
aVand melts the ceilings back taller and taller.
p70
aVBut the weirdest thing about glacier caves
p71
aVis that the entire cave is moving,
p72
aVbecause it's formed inside a block of ice
p73
aVthe size of a small city
p74
aVthat's slowly sliding down the mountain.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow this is Brent McGregor,
p77
aVmy cave exploration partner.
p78
aVHe and I have both been exploring caves a long time
p79
aVand we've been climbing mountains a long time,
p80
aVbut neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before.
p81
aVBack in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video
p82
aVof a couple of hikers that stumbled across the entrance to one of these caves.
p83
aVThere were no GPS coordinates for it,
p84
aVand all we knew was that it was somewhere
p85
aVout on the Sandy Glacier.
p86
aVSo in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,
p87
aVand we found a big crack in the ice.
p88
aVWe had to build snow and ice anchors
p89
aVso that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole.
p90
aVThis is me looking into the entrance crevasse.
p91
aVAt the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel
p92
aVgoing right up the mountain
p93
aVunderneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.
p94
aVWe followed this cave back for about a half mile
p95
aVuntil it came to an end,
p96
aVand then with the help of our survey tools
p97
aVwe made a three-dimensional map of the cave
p98
aVon our way back out.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo how do you map a cave?
p101
aVWell, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps
p102
aVbecause they have pits and holes  going to overlapping levels.
p103
aVTo make a cave map, you have to set up
p104
aVsurvey stations every few feet inside the cave,
p105
aVand you use a laser to measure the distance between those stations.
p106
aVThen you use a compass and an inclinometer
p107
aVto measure the direction the cave is headed
p108
aVand measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.
p109
aVNow those of you taking trigonometry,
p110
aVthat particular type of math is very useful
p111
aVfor making maps like this
p112
aVbecause it allows you to measure heights and distances
p113
aVwithout actually having to go there.
p114
aVIn fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,
p115
aVthe more useful I found all that math
p116
aVthat I originally hated in school to be.
p117
aVSo when you're done surveying,
p118
aVyou take all this data and you punch it into a computer
p119
aVand you find someone that can draw really well,
p120
aVand you have them draft up a map
p121
aVthat looks something like this,
p122
aVand it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage
p123
aVas well as a profile view of the passage,
p124
aVkind of like an ant farm view.
p125
aVWe named this cave Snow Dragon Cave
p126
aVbecause it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow.
p127
aVNow later this summer, as more snow melted off the glacier,
p128
aVwe found more caves, and we realized they were all connected.
p129
aa(lp130
VNot long after we mapped Snow Dragon,
p131
aVBrent discovered this new cave not very far away.
p132
aVThe inside of it was coated with ice,
p133
aVso we had to wear big spikes on our feet called crampons
p134
aVso we could walk around without slipping.
p135
aVThis cave was amazing.
p136
aVThe ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green
p137
aVbecause the sunlight from far above
p138
aVwas shining through the ice and lighting it all up.
p139
aVAnd we couldn't understand why this cave
p140
aVwas so much colder than Snow Dragon
p141
aVuntil we got to the end and we found out why.
p142
aVThere was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin
p143
aVgoing 130 feet straight up to the surface of the glacier.
p144
aVCold air from the top of the mountain
p145
aVwas flowing down this hole and blasting through the cave,
p146
aVfreezing everything inside of it.
p147
aVAnd we were so excited about finding this new pit,
p148
aVwe actually came back in January the following year
p149
aVso we could be the first ones to explore it.
p150
aVIt was so cold outside,
p151
aVwe actually had to sleep inside the cave.
p152
aVThere's our camp on the left side  of this entrance room.
p153
aVThe next morning, we climbed out of the cave
p154
aVand hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,
p155
aVwhere we finally rigged and rappelled this pit
p156
aVfor the very first time.
p157
aVBrent named this cave Pure Imagination,
p158
aVI think because the beautiful sights we saw in there
p159
aVwere beyond what we could have ever imagined.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo besides really cool ice, what else is inside these caves?
p162
aVWell not too much lives in them  because they're so cold
p163
aVand the entrance is actually covered up with snow
p164
aVfor about eight months of the year.
p165
aVBut there are some really cool things in there.
p166
aVThere's weird bacteria living in the water
p167
aVthat actually eat and digest rocks
p168
aVto make their own food
p169
aVto live under this ice.
p170
aVIn fact, this past summer, scientists collected
p171
aVsamples of water and ice
p172
aVspecifically to see if things called extremophiles,
p173
aVtiny lifeforms that are evolved to live in completely hostile conditions,
p174
aVmight be living under the ice,
p175
aVkind of like what they hope to find on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.
p176
aVAnother really cool things is that,
p177
aVas seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die,
p178
aVthey get buried in the snow
p179
aVand gradually become part of the glacier,
p180
aVsinking deeper and deeper into the ice.
p181
aVAs these caves form and melt  their way up into the ice,
p182
aVthey make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling
p183
aVand fall onto the cave floor, where we end up finding them.
p184
aVFor example, this is a noble fir seed we found.
p185
aVIt's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,
p186
aVand it's just now starting to sprout.
p187
aVThis mallard duck feather
p188
aVwas found over 1,800 feet in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.
p189
aVThis duck died on the surface of the glacier long, long ago,
p190
aVand its feathers have finally made it down through over 100 feet of ice
p191
aVbefore falling inside the cave.
p192
aVAnd this beautiful quartz crystal
p193
aVwas also found in the back of Snow Dragon.
p194
aa(lp195
VEven now, Brent and I find it hard to believe
p196
aVthat all these discoveries were  essentially in our own backyard,
p197
aVhidden away, just waiting to be found.
p198
aVLike I said earlier, the idea of discovering
p199
aVin this busy world we live in
p200
aVkind of seems like something  you can only do with space travel now,
p201
aVbut that's not true.
p202
aVEvery year, new caves get discovered
p203
aVthat no one has ever been in before.
p204
aVSo it's actually not too late for one of you
p205
aVto become a discoverer yourself.
p206
aVYou just have to be willing to look
p207
aVand go where people don't often go
p208
aVand focus your eyes and your mind
p209
aVto recognize the discovery when you see it,
p210
aVbecause it might be in your own backyard.
p211
