VI'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office
p4
aVand walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,
p5
aVand this was the cover of Fortune magazine
p6
aVsitting in the window of the pharmacy.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,
p9
aVand you get a little bit downhearted.
p10
aVBut when you start to read the article by Cliff,
p11
aVwho himself is a cancer survivor,
p12
aVwho was saved by a clinical trial
p13
aVwhere his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York
p14
aVto get an experimental therapy for \u2014
p15
aVat the time \u2014 Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,
p16
aVhe makes remarkable points here.
p17
aVAnd the point of the article was that we have gotten
p18
aVreductionist in our view of biology,
p19
aVin our view of cancer.
p20
aVFor the last 50 years, we have focused on treating
p21
aVthe individual gene
p22
aVin understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, this is an astounding table.
p25
aVAnd this is something that sobers us in our field everyday
p26
aVin that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts
p27
aVon cardiovascular disease,
p28
aVbut look at cancer. The death rate in cancer
p29
aVin over 50 years hasn't changed.
p30
aVWe've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,
p31
aVwhere we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,
p32
aVbut in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, what I'm going to tell you today,
p35
aVis a little bit of why I think that's the case,
p36
aVand then go out of my comfort zone
p37
aVand tell you where I think it's going,
p38
aVwhere a new approach \u2014 that we hope to push forward
p39
aVin terms of treating cancer.
p40
aVBecause this is wrong.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, what is cancer, first of all?
p43
aVWell, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,
p44
aVthey stick a needle in.
p45
aVThey way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:
p46
aVDoes it look normal? Does it look abnormal?
p47
aa(lp48
VSo, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.
p49
aVThis is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.
p50
aVThat is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.
p51
aVThere's no molecular test,
p52
aVthere's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,
p53
aVthere's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.
p54
aVThis is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.
p55
aa(lp56
VYou know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.
p57
aVSo, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
p58
aVIt is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.
p59
aVWe can prevent most cancers.
p60
aVYou know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.
p61
aVWe could do the same in cancer.
p62
aVI co-founded a company called Navigenics,
p63
aVwhere, if you spit into a tube \u2014
p64
aVand we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,
p65
aVall of which are delayable in many of the cancers \u2014
p66
aVyou start to identify what you could get,
p67
aVand then we can start to work to prevent them.
p68
aVBecause the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,
p69
aVwe can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.
p72
aVWhy is it a disease of the aged?
p73
aVBecause evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.
p74
aVSee, evolution protected us during our childbearing years
p75
aVand then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,
p76
aVit said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."
p77
aVSo if you look at cancers, it is very rare \u2014 extremely rare \u2014
p78
aVto have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.
p79
aVAs one gets older? Very, very common.
p80
aa(lp81
VWhy is it hard to treat?
p82
aVBecause it's heterogeneous,
p83
aVand that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
p84
aVIt starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,
p85
aVwhat we call clonal selection.
p86
aVBut, if we start to understand
p87
aVthat cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,
p88
aVthen we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer
p91
aVis that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:
p92
aV"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."
p93
aVYou then have some anatomic descriptions,
p94
aVyou get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver."
p95
aVYou then have some body part descriptions:
p96
aV"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate."
p97
aVAnd that's about it.
p98
aVSo, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.
p99
aVIt's basically symptoms.
p100
aVIt's manifestations of a disease.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhat's exciting is that over the last two or three years,
p103
aVthe government has spent 400 million dollars,
p104
aVand they've allocated another billion dollars,
p105
aVto what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
p106
aVSo, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,
p107
aVand giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
p108
aVYou know, in the mid-1850's in France,
p109
aVthey started to describe cancer by body part.
p110
aVThat hasn't changed in over 150 years.
p111
aVIt is absolutely archaic that we call cancer
p112
aVby prostate, by breast, by muscle.
p113
aVIt makes no sense, if you think about it.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, obviously, the technology is here today,
p116
aVand, over the next several years, that will change.
p117
aVYou will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.
p118
aVYou will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,
p119
aVand they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions
p120
aVthat were involved in causing this individual cancer.
p121
aVSo, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine
p122
aVmore to the science of medicine,
p123
aVand be able to do what they do in infectious disease,
p124
aVwhich is look at that organism, that bacteria,
p125
aVand then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,
p126
aVbecause you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it."
p127
aVWhen one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,
p128
aVand you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms
p129
aVand prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.
p130
aVWhy? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it \u2014
p131
aValthough we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.
p132
aa(lp133
VThe Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.
p134
aVThe first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.
p135
aVIn the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,
p136
aVand then lung cancer will come several months after.
p137
aVThere's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,
p138
aVwhich I think is going to be the next level
p139
aVin terms of understanding and classifying disease.
p140
aVBut remember, I'm not pushing genomics,
p141
aVproteomics, to be a reductionist.
p142
aVI'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.
p143
aVAnd there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.
p144
aa(lp145
VIn health care today, we spend most of the dollars \u2014
p146
aVin terms of treating disease \u2014
p147
aVmost of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.
p148
aVWe spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.
p149
aVIf you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,
p150
aVyou're going to do things a hell of a lot better.
p151
aVIf we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,
p152
aVwe can take it enormously the other direction,
p153
aVand obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.
p156
aVAnd I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.
p157
aVSo, the website of the National Cancer Institute
p158
aVsays that cancer is a genetic disease.
p159
aVThe website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,
p160
aVand maybe a second, and maybe a third,
p161
aVand that is cancer."
p162
aVBut, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.
p163
aVThis isn't a genetic disease.
p164
aVSo, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,
p165
aVand you see into the microscope a lymph node
p166
aVwhere cancer has invaded.
p167
aVYou see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.
p168
aVCancer is an interaction of a cell
p169
aVthat no longer is under growth control with the environment.
p170
aVIt's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.
p171
aVIt's what we call a system.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.
p174
aVAnd I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,
p175
aVis that we have strived to understand cancer.
p176
aVThe goal is to control cancer.
p177
aVAnd that is a very different optimization scheme,
p178
aVa very different strategy for all of us.
p179
aa(lp180
VI got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,
p181
aVone of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,
p182
aVand I said, "We've made a mistake.
p183
aVWe've all made a mistake, myself included,
p184
aVby focusing down, by being a reductionist.
p185
aVWe need to take a step back."
p186
aVAnd, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.
p187
aVPeople got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.
p188
aa(lp189
VYou know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.
p190
aVWe were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.
p191
aVI said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?"
p192
aVAnd he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?
p193
aVBut people prevailed on us, and we got together,
p194
aVand it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.
p195
aVWe have designed, and we have worked on the modeling \u2014
p196
aVand much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team \u2014
p197
aVthe modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.
p198
aVAnd I'll show you some data there
p199
aVwhere I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
p200
aa(lp201
VThe key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,
p202
aVyou have to understand the data inputs.
p203
aVYou know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,
p204
aVand I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
p205
aVand it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."
p206
aVBut if during one of those days
p207
aVyour temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,
p208
aVand you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,
p209
aVI would totally miss it.
p210
aVSo, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine
p211
aVis that you and I, and all of us,
p212
aVwe go to our doctor once a year.
p213
aVWe have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.
p214
aa(lp215
VEarlier it was referred to this direct life device.
p216
aVYou know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
p217
aVIt's a staggering device, not because it tells me
p218
aVhow many kilocalories I do every day,
p219
aVbut because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.
p220
aVAnd I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,
p221
aVand I'm not moving at all.
p222
aVAnd a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here
p223
aVare really different than we understand them,
p224
aVbecause we're not measuring them dynamically.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd so, if you think of cancer as a system,
p227
aVthere's an input and an output and a state in the middle.
p228
aVSo, the states, are equivalent classes of history,
p229
aVand the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,
p230
aVthe diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.
p231
aVThe output are our symptoms:
p232
aVDo we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?
p233
aVMost of that state is hidden.
p234
aVSo what we do in our field is we change and input,
p235
aVwe give aggressive chemotherapy,
p236
aVand we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?"
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd so, the problem is that it's not just one system,
p239
aVit's multiple systems on multiple scales.
p240
aVIt's a system of systems.
p241
aVAnd so, when you start to look at emergent systems,
p242
aVyou can look at a neuron under a microscope.
p243
aVA neuron under the microscope is very elegant
p244
aVwith little things sticking out and little things over here,
p245
aVbut when you start to put them together in a complex system,
p246
aVand you start to see that it becomes a brain,
p247
aVand that brain can create intelligence,
p248
aVwhat we're talking about in the body,
p249
aVand cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
p250
aVWell, the bad news is that these robust \u2014
p251
aVand robust is a key word \u2014
p252
aVemergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.
p253
aVThe good news is you can manipulate them.
p254
aVYou can try to control them
p255
aVwithout that fundamental understanding of every component.
p256
aa(lp257
VOne of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer
p258
aVcame out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,
p259
aVwhere they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.
p260
aVSo, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.
p261
aVThey had gotten their chemotherapy,
p262
aVand then they randomized them,
p263
aVwhere half got placebo,
p264
aVand half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.
p265
aVIt's used to treat osteoporosis,
p266
aVand they got that twice a year.
p267
aVThey looked and, in these 1,800 women,
p268
aVgiven twice a year a drug that builds bone,
p269
aVyou reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.
p270
aVReduce occurrence of cancer by a drug
p271
aVthat doesn't even touch the cancer.
p272
aVSo the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.
p273
aVYou change that system,
p274
aVand you could have a marked effect on the cancer.
p275
aa(lp276
VNobody has ever shown \u2014 and this will be shocking \u2014
p277
aVnobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy
p278
aVactually touches a cancer cell.
p279
aVIt's never been shown.
p280
aVThere's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,
p281
aVthat if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,
p282
aVbut the doses in those dishes are nowhere near
p283
aVthe doses that happen in the body.
p284
aa(lp285
VIf I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol
p286
aVevery three weeks, which is the standard,
p287
aVabout 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer
p288
aVhave a great response to that drug.
p289
aVAnd a response is 50 percent shrinkage.
p290
aVWell, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,
p291
aVbut that's a different story.
p292
aVThey then recur, I give them that same drug every week.
p293
aVAnother 30 percent will respond.
p294
aVThey then recur, I give them that same drug
p295
aVover 96 hours by continuous infusion,
p296
aVanother 20 or 30 percent will respond.
p297
aVSo, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.
p298
aVIt's not. We have no idea the mechanism.
p299
aVSo the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting
p300
aVthat complex system,
p301
aVjust like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,
p302
aVchemotherapy may work by that same exact way.
p303
aVThe wild thing about that trial also,
p304
aVwas that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.
p307
aVThey're dynamic.
p308
aVI mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,
p309
aVbut it looks at obesity in the world.
p310
aVAnd I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.
p311
aVBut, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,
p312
aVmore than 75 percent of the population
p313
aVof those countries are obese.
p314
aVLook a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.
p315
aVSo, our systems today are dramatically different
p316
aVthan our systems a decade or two ago.
p317
aVSo the diseases we have today,
p318
aVwhich reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,
p319
aVare going to change dramatically over the next decade or so
p320
aVbased on things like this.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture
p323
aVof the whole proteome.
p324
aVSo this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,
p325
aVand we're able to get resolution
p326
aVwhere we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.
p327
aVWe can start to see that system.
p328
aVEach of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.
p329
aVThe power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,
p330
aVis that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.
p331
aVSo, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis
p332
aVand a group called Applied Proteomics,
p333
aVwhere we can start to see individual neutron differences,
p334
aVand we can start to look at that system like we never have before.
p335
aVSo, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo this is a woman, 46 years old,
p338
aVwho had recurrent lung cancer.
p339
aVIt was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.
p340
aVShe had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,
p341
aVGemcitabine, Navelbine:
p342
aVEvery drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.
p343
aVShe had three kids under the age of 12,
p344
aVand this is her CT scan.
p345
aVAnd so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,
p346
aVand you can see in the middle there is her heart,
p347
aVand to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor
p348
aVthat will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.
p349
aVShe goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,
p350
aVand again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,
p351
aVbut it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
p352
aVSix months later it's still gone.
p353
aVThat cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,
p354
aVbut she got three years from a drug
p355
aVwhose symptoms predominately were acne.
p356
aVThat's about it.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,
p359
aVand we were a part of it,
p360
aVand in the fundamental clinical trial \u2014
p361
aVthe pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,
p362
aVwe refused to use a placebo.
p363
aVWould you want your mother, your brother, your sister
p364
aVto get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?
p365
aVAnd the answer, obviously, is not.
p366
aVSo, it was done on this group of patients.
p367
aVTen percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,
p368
aVand the drug went to the FDA,
p369
aVand the FDA said, "Without a placebo,
p370
aVhow do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?"
p371
aVSo the morning the FDA was going to meet,
p372
aVthis was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aVAnd so, what do you know, that drug was approved.
p375
aa(lp376
VThe amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,
p377
aVwhere they gave half placebo and half the drug.
p378
aVAnd we learned something important there.
p379
aVWhat's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,
p380
aVwhere it's "more ethical to give placebos."
p381
aVThey had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,
p382
aVso I think there were three U.S. patients
p383
aVin upstate New York who were part of the trial.
p384
aVBut they did that, and what they found
p385
aVis that 70 percent of the non-responders
p386
aVlived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.
p387
aVSo it challenged everything we knew in cancer,
p388
aVis that you don't need to get a response.
p389
aVYou don't need to shrink the disease.
p390
aVIf we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit
p391
aVon patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,
p392
aVthan if we shrink the disease.
p393
aa(lp394
VThe problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today
p395
aVand you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,
p396
aVand you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,
p397
aVdid that drug help you or not?
p398
aVHow do I know?
p399
aVWould it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug
p400
aVwith no benefit and significant cost?
p401
aVSo, it's a fundamental problem.
p402
aVAnd, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office \u2014
p405
aVwell, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?
p406
aVThe ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.
p407
aVThat is the most effective, cost-effective,
p408
aVbest way we can do things today.
p409
aVBut if one is unfortunate to get a disease,
p410
aVyou'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,
p411
aVand we will start to know how to treat your disease.
p412
aVThe way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,
p413
aVagain, this looking at the system.
p414
aVIt's taking a big picture.
p415
aa(lp416
VThe problem with technologies like this is
p417
aVthat if one looks at proteins in the body,
p418
aVthere are 11 orders of magnitude difference
p419
aVbetween the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.
p420
aVSo, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.
p421
aVAnd so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others
p422
aVis to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.
p423
aVWe can start to look at different components along this spectrum.
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.
p426
aVAnd I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now
p427
aVis that people from those fields are coming in.
p428
aVYesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program
p429
aVcalled the Physical Sciences and Oncology,
p430
aVwhere physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,
p431
aVpeople who never approached it before.
p432
aVDanny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,
p433
aVto try to attach this problem.
p434
aVA whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy
p435
aVby different mechanisms,
p436
aVto try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.
p437
aa(lp438
VSo, just for two seconds, how these technologies work \u2014
p439
aVbecause I think it's important to understand it.
p440
aVWhat happens is every protein in your body is charged,
p441
aVso the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,
p442
aVand then there's a detector at the end.
p443
aVWhen it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.
p444
aVAnd so we can accurately \u2014 if the magnet is big enough,
p445
aVand your resolution is high enough \u2014
p446
aVyou can actually detect all of the proteins in the body
p447
aVand start to get an understanding of the individual system.
p448
aa(lp449
VAnd so, as a cancer doctor,
p450
aVinstead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,
p451
aVthis is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,
p452
aVwhere that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.
p453
aVElectronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.
p454
aVAnd certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter
p455
aVand actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,
p456
aVwithout fundamental learning.
p457
aa(lp458
VSo, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.
p459
aVWe need to start to think differently and radically.
p460
aVAnd so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.
p461
aVTell them to me or anyone else in our field,
p462
aVbecause over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.
p463
aVWe need a radically different approach.
p464
aa(lp465
VYou know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel \u2014
p466
aVand Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.
p467
aVWhen Andy stepped down, he said,
p468
aV"No technology will win. Technology itself will win."
p469
aVAnd I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,
p470
aVthat it's going to be a broad platform of technologies
p471
aVthat will help us move forward
p472
aVand hopefully help patients in the near-term.
p473
aa(lp474
