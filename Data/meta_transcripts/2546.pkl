VThis is a man-made forest.
p4
aVIt can spread over acres and acres of area,
p5
aVor it could fit in a small space \u2014
p6
aVas small as your house garden.
p7
aVEach of these forests is just two years old.
p8
aVI have a forest in the backyard of my own house.
p9
aVIt attracts a lot of biodiversity.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Bird call)
p12
aa(lp13
VI wake up to this every morning,
p14
aVlike a Disney princess.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VI am an entrepreneur
p19
aVwho facilitates the making of these forests professionally.
p20
aVWe have helped factories,
p21
aVfarms,
p22
aVschools,
p23
aVhomes,
p24
aVresorts,
p25
aVapartment buildings,
p26
aVpublic parks
p27
aVand even a zoo
p28
aVto have one of such forests.
p29
aVA forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.
p30
aVA forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
p31
aVA forest, for me,
p32
aVis a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
p33
aVIt doesn't matter how big or small they are.
p34
aa(lp35
VMost of the world we live in today was forest.
p36
aVThis was before human intervention.
p37
aVThen we built up our cities on those forests,
p38
aVlike São Paulo,
p39
aVforgetting that we belong to nature as well,
p40
aVas much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.
p41
aVOur habitat stopped being our natural habitat.
p42
aVBut not anymore for some of us.
p43
aVA few others and I today make these forests professionally \u2014
p44
aVanywhere and everywhere.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'm an industrial engineer.
p47
aVI specialize in making cars.
p48
aVIn my previous job at Toyota,
p49
aVI learned how to convert natural resources into products.
p50
aVTo give you an example,
p51
aVwe would drip the sap out of a rubber tree,
p52
aVconvert it into raw rubber
p53
aVand make a tire out of it \u2014 the product.
p54
aVBut these products can never become a natural resource again.
p55
aVWe separate the elements from nature
p56
aVand convert them into an irreversible state.
p57
aVThat's industrial production.
p58
aa(lp59
VNature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.
p60
aVThe natural system produces by bringing elements together,
p61
aVatom by atom.
p62
aVAll the natural products become a natural resource again.
p63
aVThis is something which I learned
p64
aVwhen I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.
p65
aVAnd this was the first time I worked with nature,
p66
aVrather than against it.
p67
aVSince then,
p68
aVwe have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.
p69
aVEvery time we work at a new place,
p70
aVwe find that every single element needed to make a forest
p71
aVis available right around us.
p72
aVAll we have to do is to bring these elements together
p73
aVand let nature take over.
p74
aa(lp75
VTo make a forest we start with soil.
p76
aVWe touch, feel and even taste it
p77
aVto identify what properties it lacks.
p78
aVIf the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact \u2014
p79
aVso compact, that water cannot seep in.
p80
aVWe mix some local biomass available around,
p81
aVwhich can help soil become more porous.
p82
aVWater can now seep in.
p83
aVIf the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water,
p84
aVwe will mix some more biomass \u2014
p85
aVsome water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse,
p86
aVso soil can hold this water and it stays moist.
p87
aa(lp88
VTo grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.
p89
aVWhat if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?
p90
aVWe don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.
p91
aVThat would be the industrial way.
p92
aVIt goes against nature.
p93
aVWe instead add microorganisms to the soil.
p94
aVThey produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.
p95
aVThey feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil,
p96
aVso all they have to do is eat and multiply.
p97
aVAnd as their number grows,
p98
aVthe soil starts breathing again.
p99
aVIt becomes alive.
p100
aa(lp101
VWe survey the native tree species of the place.
p102
aVHow do we decide what's native or not?
p103
aVWell, whatever existed before human intervention is native.
p104
aVThat's the simple rule.
p105
aVWe survey a national park
p106
aVto find the last remains of a natural forest.
p107
aVWe survey the sacred groves,
p108
aVor sacred forests around old temples.
p109
aVAnd if we don't find anything at all,
p110
aVwe go to museums
p111
aVto see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.
p112
aVWe research old paintings, poems and literature from the place,
p113
aVto identify the tree species belonging there.
p114
aa(lp115
VOnce we know our trees,
p116
aVwe divide them in four different layers:
p117
aVshrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.
p118
aVWe fix the ratios of each layer,
p119
aVand then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.
p120
aVIf we are making a fruit forest,
p121
aVwe increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.
p122
aVIt could be a flowering forest,
p123
aVa forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees,
p124
aVor it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest.
p125
aa(lp126
VWe collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.
p127
aVWe make sure that trees belonging to the same layer
p128
aVare not planted next to each other,
p129
aVor they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.
p130
aVWe plant the saplings close to each other.
p131
aVOn the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch,
p132
aVso when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.
p133
aVWhen it's cold,
p134
aVfrost formation happens only on the mulch,
p135
aVso soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.
p136
aVThe soil is very soft \u2014
p137
aVso soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily,
p138
aVrapidly.
p139
aa(lp140
VInitially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing,
p141
aVbut it's growing under the surface.
p142
aVIn the first three months,
p143
aVroots reach a depth of one meter.
p144
aVThese roots form a mesh,
p145
aVtightly holding the soil.
p146
aVMicrobes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.
p147
aVSo if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree,
p148
aVthese microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.
p149
aVWhenever it rains,
p150
aVmagically,
p151
aVmushrooms appear overnight.
p152
aVAnd this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network.
p153
aa(lp154
VOnce these roots are established,
p155
aVforest starts growing on the surface.
p156
aVAs the forest grows we keep watering it \u2014
p157
aVfor the next two to three years, we water the forest.
p158
aVWe want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees,
p159
aVso we remove the weeds growing on the ground.
p160
aVAs this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.
p161
aVEventually, the forest becomes so dense
p162
aVthat sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.
p163
aVWeeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.
p164
aa(lp165
VAt this stage,
p166
aVevery single drop of water that falls into the forest
p167
aVdoesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.
p168
aVThis dense forest condenses the moist air
p169
aVand retains its moisture.
p170
aVWe gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.
p171
aVAnd even without watering,
p172
aVthe forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.
p173
aVNow, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor,
p174
aVit immediately starts decaying.
p175
aVThis decayed biomass forms humus,
p176
aVwhich is food for the forest.
p177
aVAs the forest grows,
p178
aVmore leaves fall on the surface \u2014
p179
aVit means more humus is produced,
p180
aVit means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.
p181
aVAnd this forest keeps growing exponentially.
p182
aa(lp183
VOnce established,
p184
aVthese forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again \u2014
p185
aVprobably forever.
p186
aVIn a natural forest like this,
p187
aVno management is the best management.
p188
aVIt's a tiny jungle party.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VThis forest grows as a collective.
p193
aVIf the same trees \u2014
p194
aVsame species \u2014
p195
aVwould have been planted independently,
p196
aVit wouldn't grow so fast.
p197
aVAnd this is how we create a 100-year-old forest
p198
aVin just 10 years.
p199
