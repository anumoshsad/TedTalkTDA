VAs an artist,
p4
aVconnection is very important to me.
p5
aVThrough my work I'm trying to articulate
p6
aVthat humans are not separate from nature
p7
aVand that everything is interconnected.
p8
aVI first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,
p9
aVwhere I saw my first icebergs.
p10
aVI was in awe.
p11
aVMy heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,
p12
aVtrying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.
p13
aVThe icebergs around me
p14
aVwere almost 200 feet out of the water,
p15
aVand I could only help but wonder
p16
aVthat this was one snowflake
p17
aVon top of another snowflake,
p18
aVyear after year.
p19
aa(lp20
VIcebergs are born
p21
aVwhen they calve off of glaciers
p22
aVor break off of ice shelves.
p23
aVEach iceberg has its own individual personality.
p24
aVThey have a distinct way
p25
aVof interacting with their environment
p26
aVand their experiences.
p27
aVSome refuse to give up
p28
aVand hold on to the bitter end,
p29
aVwhile others can't take it anymore
p30
aVand crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.
p31
aa(lp32
VIt's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,
p33
aVthat they're isolated,
p34
aVthat they're separate and alone,
p35
aVmuch like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.
p36
aVBut the reality is far from it.
p37
aVAs an iceberg melts,
p38
aVI am breathing in
p39
aVits ancient atmosphere.
p40
aVAs the iceberg melts,
p41
aVit is releasing mineral-rich fresh water
p42
aVthat nourishes many forms of life.
p43
aa(lp44
VI approach photographing these icebergs
p45
aVas if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,
p46
aVknowing that in these individual moments
p47
aVthey exist in that way
p48
aVand will never exist that way again.
p49
aVIt is not a death when they melt;
p50
aVit is not an end,
p51
aVbut a continuation
p52
aVof their path through the cycle of life.
p53
aVSome of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young \u2014
p54
aVa couple thousand years old.
p55
aVAnd some of the ice
p56
aVis over 100,000 years old.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe last pictures I'd like to show you
p59
aVare of an iceberg that I photographed
p60
aVin Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.
p61
aVIt's a very rare occasion
p62
aVthat you get to actually witness
p63
aVan iceberg rolling.
p64
aVSo here it is.
p65
aVYou can see on the left side a small boat.
p66
aVThat's about a 15-foot boat.
p67
aVAnd I'd like you to pay attention
p68
aVto the shape of the iceberg
p69
aVand where it is at the waterline.
p70
aVYou can see here, it begins to roll,
p71
aVand the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
p72
aVThis is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.
p73
aVIt's about 120 feet above the water,
p74
aVor 40 meters.
p75
aVAnd this video is real time.
p76

p78
aa(lp79
VAnd just like that,
p80
aVthe iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.
p81
aa(lp82
VThank you.
