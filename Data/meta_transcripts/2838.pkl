VHi everyone.
p4
aVSo, I'm going to take us back to 2007.
p5
aVI'd just spent about six months working on album
p6
aVthat I'd poured my heart and my soul into,
p7
aVand it was getting about three plays per day on Myspace at the time,
p8
aVand I was getting more and more depressed when I started noticing these other people
p9
aVwho were playing guitar and singing
p10
aVand putting videos on this new site called YouTube,
p11
aVand they were getting 300,000 views.
p12
aVSo I decided I'm going to start making some Youtube videos.
p13
aVAnd one day they featured a video of my band on the homepage,
p14
aVwhich was amazing \u2014 we got a bunch of new fans.
p15
aVWe also got a bunch of people
p16
aVwho, I guess, just didn't really like the music or something \u2014
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VIt's OK because people started coming to our shows,
p21
aVand we started touring,
p22
aVand we came out with a record.
p23
aVAnd when I checked our bank account balance
p24
aVafter our first monthly iTunes payout,
p25
aVwe had 22,000 bucks in it,
p26
aVwhich was amazing because at the time I was living at my dad's house,
p27
aVtrying to make a living as a musician by uploading videos to the internet
p28
aVwhich literally zero people respected in 2009 \u2014
p29
aVeven the people who were uploading videos to the internet.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd so for the next four years,
p32
aVI uploaded more and more videos to the Internet,
p33
aVand they got better and better,
p34
aVand we made enough money through brand deals
p35
aVand commercials and iTunes sales
p36
aVto buy a house.
p37
aVAnd we built a recording studio.
p38
aVBut there was one big problem:
p39
aVmaking money as a creative person in 2013 was super weird.
p40
aVFirst of all, the business models were changing all the time.
p41
aVSo our 58,000 dollars of annual iTunes download income
p42
aVwas about to be replaced by about 6,000 dollars of streaming income.
p43
aVSteams paid less than downloads.
p44
aVAnd then as more and more creators started popping up online,
p45
aVthere was just more competition for these five-figure brand deals
p46
aVthat had kept the band afloat for years.
p47
aVAnd to top it all off, our videos themselves \u2014
p48
aVthe creative stuff that we made that our fans loved and appreciated \u2014
p49
aVthat were actually contributing value to the world,
p50
aVthose videos were generating almost zero dollars of income for us.
p51
aVThis is an actual snapshot of my YouTube dashboard
p52
aVfrom a 28-day period
p53
aVthat shows one million views
p54
aVand 166 dollars of ad earnings for those views.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe whole machine in 2013
p57
aVthat took art online and outputted money
p58
aVwas totally nonfunctional.
p59
aVIt doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,
p60
aVor an institution,
p61
aVor an independent creator.
p62
aVA monthly web comic with 20,000 monthly readers \u2014
p63
aV20,000 monthly readers \u2014
p64
aVgets paid a couple hundred bucks in ad revenue.
p65
aVThis is 20,000 people.
p66
aVLike, in what world is this not enough?
p67
aVI don't understand.
p68
aVWhat systems have we built where this is insufficient
p69
aVfor a person to make a living?
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, I actually have a theory about this.
p72
aVI think it's been a weird 100 years.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
V(Applause)
p77
aa(lp78
VAbout 100 years ago,
p79
aVhumans figured out how to record sound onto a wax cylinder.
p80
aVThat was the beginning of the phonograph.
p81
aVRight around the same time,
p82
aVwe figured out how to record light onto a piece of photographic paper,
p83
aVcelluloid \u2014 the beginning of film and television.
p84
aVFor the first time, you could store art on a thing,
p85
aVwhich was amazing.
p86
aVArt used to be completely ephemeral,
p87
aVso if you missed the symphony, you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.
p88
aVBut now, for the first time,
p89
aVyou could store the orchestra's performance on a physical object,
p90
aVand like, listen to it later,
p91
aVwhich was amazing.
p92
aVIt was so amazing in fact,
p93
aVthat for the next 100 years, between 1900 and 2000,
p94
aVhumans built just billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure
p95
aVto essentially help artists do two things.
p96
aVFirst, put their art on a thing,
p97
aVand second, get that thing around the world
p98
aVto the people who wanted the art.
p99
aVSo, so much industry is devoted to these two problems.
p100
aVOh my gosh, there are trucking companies,
p101
aVand brick-and-mortar and marketing firms, and CD jewel case manufacturers,
p102
aVall devoted to these two problems.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd then we all know what happened.
p105
aV10 years ago, the internet matures
p106
aVand we get Spotify and Facebook and YouTube
p107
aVand iTunes and Google search,
p108
aVand a hundred years of infrastructure
p109
aVand supply chains and distribution systems
p110
aVand monetization schemes
p111
aVare completely bypassed \u2014
p112
aVin a decade.
p113
aVAfter 100 years of designing these things,
p114
aVit's no wonder that it's just totally broken for creative people right now.
p115
aVIt's no wonder that the monetization part of the chain doesn't work
p116
aVgiven this new context.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut what gets me super excited to be a creator right now,
p119
aVto be alive today and be a creative person right now,
p120
aVis realizing that we're only 10 years into figuring out this new machine \u2014
p121
aVto figuring out the next 100 years of infrastructure for our creators.
p122
aVAnd you can tell we're only 10 years in.
p123
aVThere's a lot of trial and error, some really good ideas forming,
p124
aVa lot of experimentation.
p125
aVWe're figuring out what works and what doesn't.
p126
aVLike Twitch streamers. Who's heard of Twitch?
p127
aVTwitch streamers are making three to five thousand bucks a month
p128
aVstreaming gaming content.
p129
aVThe big ones are making over 100,000 dollars a year.
p130
aVThere's a site called YouNow,
p131
aVit's an app.
p132
aVIt allows musicians and vloggers to get paid in digital goods from fans.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo, I'm also working on the problem.
p135
aVFour years ago I started a company called Patreon
p136
aVwith a friend of mine.
p137
aVWe're 80 people now working on this problem.
p138
aVIt's basically a membership platform
p139
aVthat makes it really easy for creators to get paid \u2014
p140
aVevery month from their fans to earn a living.
p141
aVFor a creator, it's like having a salary for being a creative person.
p142
aVAnd this is one of our creators.
p143
aVThey're called "Kinda Funny."
p144
aVThey have about 220,000 subscribers on YouTube.
p145
aVAnd when they upload a video,
p146
aVit gets somewhere around 15,000 views to 100,000 views.
p147
aVI want you to check yourselves right now.
p148
aVI think when we hear numbers like that, when we hear "15,000 views,"
p149
aVand we see content like this,
p150
aVwe just snap categorize it as being not as legitimate
p151
aVas a morning show that you'd hear on the radio
p152
aVor a talk show that you'd see on NBC or something
p153
aVBut when "Kinda Funny" launched on Patreon,
p154
aVwithin a few weeks, they were making 31,000 dollars per month
p155
aVfor this show.
p156
aVIt took off so fast that they decided to expand their programming
p157
aVand add new shows,
p158
aVand now they launched a second Patreon page \u2014
p159
aVthey're making an additional 21,000 dollars per month.
p160
aVAnd they're scaling what's essentially becoming a media company,
p161
aVfinancing the whole thing through membership.
p162
aa(lp163
VOK, here's another example.
p164
aVThis is Derek Bodner,
p165
aVa sports journalist who used to write for Philadelphia Magazine
p166
aVuntil a few months ago when the magazine cut out all sports coverage.
p167
aVNow he writes articles and publishes them on his own website \u2014
p168
aVhe's still covering sports, but for himself.
p169
aVAnd he's making 4,800 bucks a month from 1,700 patrons,
p170
aVfinancing it through membership.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is Crash Course \u2014
p173
aVfree educational content for the world.
p174
aVThis show is actually on the PBS digital network \u2014
p175
aV29,000 dollars per month.
p176
aVThis is a duo sailing around the world,
p177
aVgetting paid every month for documenting their travels
p178
aVfrom 1,400 patrons.
p179
aVThis is a podcast, "Chapo Trap House", making \u2014
p180
aVactually, since I screenshotted this,
p181
aVthey're making an additional 2,000 dollars per month,
p182
aVso they're now making 56,000 dollars per month for their podcast.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd Patreon's not the only one working on the problem.
p185
aVEven Google's starting to work on this.
p186
aVA couple years ago, they launched Fan Funding;
p187
aVmore recently, they launched Super Chat
p188
aVas a way for creators to monetize live streaming.
p189
aVNewspapers are starting to experiment with membership.
p190
aVNew York Times has a membership program;
p191
aVThe Guardian has over 200,000 paying subscribers
p192
aVto its membership program.
p193
aVThere's this bubbling soup of ideas and experiments
p194
aVand progress right now,
p195
aVand it's pointing in the direction of getting creators paid.
p196
aVAnd it's working.
p197
aVIt's not, like, perfect yet,
p198
aVbut it's really working.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, Patreon has over 50,000 creators on the platform making salaries \u2014
p201
aVgetting paid every month for putting art online,
p202
aVfor being a creative person.
p203
aVThe next hundred years of infrastructure is on the way
p204
aVand it's going to be different this time because of this \u2014
p205
aVbecause of the direct connection between the person who makes the thing
p206
aVand the person who likes the thing.
p207
aa(lp208
VAbout seven or eight years ago,
p209
aVI went to a cocktail party.
p210
aVThis is when the band had hit our first machine,
p211
aVso things were really cranking.
p212
aVWe had just made about 400,000 dollars in one year
p213
aVthrough iTunes sales and brand deals and stuff like that.
p214
aVAnd this guy comes up to me and says,
p215
aV"Hey, Jack, what do you do?"
p216
aVI said, "I'm a musician."
p217
aVAnd he just sobered up immediately,
p218
aVand he stuck out his hand,
p219
aVput a hand on my shoulder,
p220
aVand in a real earnest, very nice voice he was like,
p221
aV"I hope you make it someday."
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd ...
p226
aVI have so many moments like that logged in my memory.
p227
aVI just cringe thinking of that.
p228
aVIt's so embarrassing to just not feel valued as a creative person.
p229
aVBut as a species,
p230
aVwe are leaving that cocktail party behind.
p231
aVWe're leaving that culture,
p232
aVwe're out of there.
p233
aVWe're going to get so good at paying creators,
p234
aVwithin 10 years,
p235
aVkids graduating high school and college are going to think of being a creator
p236
aVas just being an option \u2014
p237
aVI could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,
p238
aVI could be a podcaster, I could have a web comic.
p239
aVIt's just going to be something you can do.
p240
aVWe're figuring it out.
p241
aVIt's going to be a viable and sustainable and respected profession.
p242
aVCreators are going to come out the other end of this weird 100 years,
p243
aVthis century-long journey,
p244
aVwith an awesome new machine.
p245
aVAnd they're going to be paid, and they're going to be valued.
p246
aVThanks, everybody.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
VI think it went pretty well.
p251
aVI want artists who saw that to not give up \u2014
p252
aVto know that we're getting there.
p253
aVIt's not there yet,
p254
aVbut in a couple years,
p255
aVthere will be so many systems and tools for them
p256
aVto just make a living online,
p257
aVand if they've got a podcast that's starting to take off,
p258
aVbut they're not able to make money on it yet,
p259
aVthat's happening
p260
aVand they're going to be paid.
p261
aVIt's happening.
