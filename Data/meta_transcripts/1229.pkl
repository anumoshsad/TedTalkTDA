VEveryone's familiar with cancer,
p4
aVbut we don't normally think of cancer
p5
aVas being a contagious disease.
p6
aVThe Tasmanian devil has shown us
p7
aVthat, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,
p8
aVbut it can also threaten
p9
aVan entire species with extinction.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?
p12
aVMany of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,
p13
aVthe one that spins around and around and around.
p14
aVBut not many people know
p15
aVthat there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,
p16
aVand it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
p17
aVA marsupial is a mammal with a pouch
p18
aVlike a kangaroo.
p19
aVThe Tasmanian devil got its name
p20
aVfrom the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Screaming)
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VThe Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,
p27
aVand it uses its powerful jaws
p28
aVand its sharp teeth
p29
aVto chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
p30
aV[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,
p31
aVwhich is that small island
p32
aVjust to the south of the mainland of Australia.
p33
aVAnd despite their ferocious appearance,
p34
aVTasmanian devils are actually
p35
aVquite adorable little animals.
p36
aVIn fact, growing up in Tasmania,
p37
aVit always was incredibly exciting
p38
aVwhen we got a chance to see
p39
aVa Tasmanian devil in the wild.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut the Tasmanian devil population
p42
aVhas been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.
p43
aVAnd in fact, there's concern
p44
aVthat the species could go extinct in the wild
p45
aVwithin 20 to 30 years.
p46
aVAnd the reason for that
p47
aVis the emergence of a new disease,
p48
aVa contagious cancer.
p49
aa(lp50
VThe story begins in 1996
p51
aVwhen a wildlife photographer took this photograph here
p52
aVof a Tasmanian devil
p53
aVwith a large tumor on its face.
p54
aVAt the time, this was thought to be a one-off.
p55
aVAnimals, just like humans,
p56
aVsometimes get strange tumors.
p57
aVHowever, we now believe
p58
aVthat this is the first sighting of a new disease,
p59
aVwhich is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.
p60
aVThe disease was first sighted
p61
aVin the northeast of Tasmania in 1996
p62
aVand has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.
p63
aVNow there's only a small part of the population,
p64
aVwhich remains unaffected.
p65
aa(lp66
VThis disease appears first as tumors,
p67
aVusually on the face or inside the mouth
p68
aVof affected Tasmanian devils.
p69
aVThese tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,
p70
aVsuch as these ones here.
p71
aVAnd the next image I'm going to show
p72
aVis quite gruesome.
p73
aVBut inevitably, these tumors progress
p74
aVtowards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis one in particular sticks in my mind,
p77
aVbecause this is the first case of this disease
p78
aVthat I saw myself.
p79
aVAnd I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil
p80
aVwith this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor
p81
aVinside her mouth
p82
aVthat had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.
p83
aVShe hadn't eaten for days.
p84
aVHer guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
p85
aVHer body was riddled with secondary tumors.
p86
aVAnd yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils
p87
aVin her pouch.
p88
aVOf course, they died along with the mother.
p89
aVThey were too young to survive without their mother.
p90
aVIn fact, in the area where she comes from,
p91
aVmore than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population
p92
aVhas already died of this disease.
p93
aa(lp94
VScientists around the world
p95
aVwere intrigued by this cancer,
p96
aVthis infectious cancer,
p97
aVthat was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.
p98
aVAnd our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,
p99
aVwhich is spread by a virus,
p100
aVand to the AIDS epidemic,
p101
aVwhich is associated with a number of different types of cancer.
p102
aVAll the evidence suggested that this devil cancer
p103
aVwas spread by a virus.
p104
aVHowever, we now know \u2014 and I'll tell you right now \u2014
p105
aVthat we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.
p106
aVIn fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer
p107
aVis something altogether more sinister,
p108
aVand something that we hadn't really thought of before.
p109
aVBut in order for me to explain what that is,
p110
aVI need to spend just a couple of minutes
p111
aVtalking more about cancer itself.
p112
aa(lp113
VCancer is a disease
p114
aVthat affects millions of people around the world every year.
p115
aVOne in three people in this room
p116
aVwill develop cancer at some stage in their lives.
p117
aVI myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine
p118
aVwhen I was only 14.
p119
aVCancer occurs
p120
aVwhen a single cell in your body
p121
aVacquires a set of random mutations in important genes
p122
aVthat cause that cell to start to produce
p123
aVmore and more and more copies of itself.
p124
aVParadoxically, once established,
p125
aVnatural selection actually favors
p126
aVthe continued growth of cancer.
p127
aVNatural selection is survival of the fittest.
p128
aVAnd when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,
p129
aVif one of them acquires new mutations,
p130
aVwhich allow them to grow more quickly,
p131
aVacquire nutrients more successfully,
p132
aVinvade the body,
p133
aVthey'll be selected for by evolution.
p134
aa(lp135
VThat's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
p136
aVIt evolves.
p137
aVThrow a drug at it,
p138
aVand resistant cells will grow back.
p139
aVAn amazing fact is that,
p140
aVgiven the right environment and the right nutrients,
p141
aVa cancer cell has the potential
p142
aVto go on growing forever.
p143
aVHowever cancer is constrained
p144
aVby living inside our bodies,
p145
aVand its continued growth,
p146
aVits spreading through our bodies
p147
aVand eating away at our tissues,
p148
aVleads to the death of the cancer patient
p149
aVand also to the death of the cancer itself.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo cancer could be thought of
p152
aVas a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form \u2014
p153
aVan evolutionary dead end.
p154
aVBut that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer
p155
aVhas acquired an absolutely amazing
p156
aVevolutionary adaptation.
p157
aVAnd the answer came from studying
p158
aVthe Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.
p159
aVThis was work from many people,
p160
aVbut I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment
p161
aVthat I did a few years ago.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe next slide is going to be gruesome.
p164
aVThis is Jonas.
p165
aVHe's a Tasmanian devil that we found
p166
aVwith a large tumor on his face.
p167
aVAnd being a geneticist,
p168
aVI'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.
p169
aVSo I took this opportunity
p170
aVto collect some samples from Jonas' tumor
p171
aVand also some samples from other parts of his body.
p172
aVI took these back to the lab.
p173
aVI extracted DNA from them.
p174
aVAnd when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,
p175
aVand compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor
p176
aVto that of the rest of his body,
p177
aVI discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.
p178
aVIn fact, Jonas and his tumor
p179
aVwere as different from each other
p180
aVas you and the person sitting next to you.
p181
aVWhat this told us was that Jonas' tumor
p182
aVdid not arise from cells of his own body.
p183
aVIn fact, more genetic profiling
p184
aVtold us that this tumor in Jonas
p185
aVactually probably first arose
p186
aVfrom the cells of a female Tasmanian devil \u2014
p187
aVand Jonas was clearly a male.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo how come
p190
aVa tumor that arose from the cells of another individual
p191
aVis growing on Jonas' face?
p192
aVWell the next breakthrough
p193
aVcame from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers
p194
aVfrom all around Tasmania.
p195
aVWe found that all of these cancers
p196
aVshared the same DNA.
p197
aVThink about that for a minute.
p198
aVThat means that all of these cancers
p199
aVactually are the same cancer
p200
aVthat arose once from one individual devil,
p201
aVthat have broken free of that first devil's body
p202
aVand spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.
p203
aa(lp204
VBut how can a cancer spread in a population?
p205
aVWell the final piece of the puzzle came
p206
aVwhen we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.
p207
aVThey tend to bite each other,
p208
aVoften quite ferociously and usually on the face.
p209
aVWe think that cancer cells
p210
aVactually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
p211
aVWhen the devil bites another devil,
p212
aVit actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,
p213
aVso the tumor continues to grow.
p214
aVSo this Tasmanian devil cancer
p215
aVis perhaps the ultimate cancer.
p216
aVIt's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
p217
aVIt spreads through the population,
p218
aVhas mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,
p219
aVand it's the only cancer that we know of
p220
aVthat's threatening an entire species with extinction.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,
p223
aVwhy hasn't it happened in other animals
p224
aVor even humans?
p225
aVWell the answer is, it has.
p226
aVThis is Kimbo.
p227
aVHe's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.
p228
aVLast year, his owner noticed some blood
p229
aVtrickling from his genital region.
p230
aVShe took him to the vet
p231
aVand the vet discovered something quite disgusting.
p232
aVAnd if you're squeamish, please look away now.
p233
aVHe discovered this,
p234
aVa huge bleeding tumor
p235
aVat the base of Kimbo's penis.
p236
aVThe vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,
p237
aVa sexually transmitted cancer
p238
aVthat affects dogs.
p239
aVAnd just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious
p240
aVthrough the spread of living cancer cells,
p241
aVso is this dog cancer.
p242
aa(lp243
VBut this dog cancer is quite remarkable,
p244
aVbecause it spread all around the world.
p245
aVAnd in fact, these same cells
p246
aVthat are affecting Kimbo here
p247
aVare also found affecting dogs
p248
aVin New York City,
p249
aVin mountain villages in the Himalayas
p250
aVand in Outback Australia.
p251
aVWe also believe this cancer might be very old.
p252
aVIn fact, genetic profiling tells
p253
aVthat it may be tens of thousands of years old,
p254
aVwhich means that this cancer
p255
aVmay have first arisen
p256
aVfrom the cells of a wolf
p257
aVthat lived alongside the Neanderthals.
p258
aVThis cancer is remarkable.
p259
aVIt's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
p260
aVIt's a living relic
p261
aVof the distant past.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo we've seen that this can happen in animals.
p264
aVCould cancers be contagious between people?
p265
aVWell this is a question
p266
aVwhich fascinated Chester Southam,
p267
aVa cancer doctor in the 1950s.
p268
aVAd he decided to put this to the test
p269
aVby actually deliberately inoculating people
p270
aVwith cancer from somebody else.
p271
aVAnd this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957
p272
aVinjecting cancer into a volunteer,
p273
aVwho in this case was an inmate
p274
aVin Ohio State Penitentiary.
p275
aVMost of the people that Dr. Southam injected
p276
aVdid not go on to develop cancer
p277
aVfrom the injected cells.
p278
aVBut a small number of them did,
p279
aVand they were mostly people who were otherwise ill \u2014
p280
aVwhose immune systems were probably compromised.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhat this tells us,
p283
aVethical issues aside,
p284
aVis that ...
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVit's probably extremely rare
p287
aVfor cancers to be transferred between people.
p288
aVHowever, under some circumstances,
p289
aVit can happen.
p290
aVAnd I think that this is something
p291
aVthat oncologists and epidemiologists
p292
aVshould be aware of in the future.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo just finally,
p295
aVcancer is an inevitable outcome
p296
aVof the ability of our cells
p297
aVto divide
p298
aVand to adapt to their environments.
p299
aVBut that does not mean that we should give up hope
p300
aVin the fight against cancer.
p301
aVIn fact, I believe, given more knowledge
p302
aVof the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,
p303
aVwe can defeat cancer.
p304
aVMy personal aim
p305
aVis to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.
p306
aVLet's prevent the Tasmanian devil
p307
aVfrom being the first animal
p308
aVto go extinct from cancer.
