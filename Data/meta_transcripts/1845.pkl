VAs humans, it's in our nature
p4
aVto want to improve our health  and minimize our suffering.
p5
aVWhatever life throws at us,
p6
aVwhether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
p7
aVor even broken bones, we want to try and get better.
p8
aVNow I'm head of a biomaterials lab,
p9
aVand I'm really fascinated by the way that humans
p10
aVhave used materials in really creative ways
p11
aVin the body over time.
p12
aa(lp13
VTake, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.
p14
aVThis was actually used by the Mayans
p15
aVas an artificial tooth replacement.
p16
aVWe're not quite sure why they did it.
p17
aVIt's hard. It's durable.
p18
aVBut it also had other very nice properties.
p19
aVIn fact, when they put it into the jawbone,
p20
aVit could integrate into the jaw,
p21
aVand we know now with very sophisticated
p22
aVimaging technologies
p23
aVthat part of that integration comes from the fact
p24
aVthat this material is designed
p25
aVin a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,
p26
aVhas a beautiful architecture.
p27
aVAnd I think in many ways we can sort of think
p28
aVof the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans
p29
aVas the first real application
p30
aVof the bluetooth technology.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut if we move on and think throughout history
p35
aVhow people have used different  materials in the body,
p36
aVvery often it's been physicians
p37
aVthat have been quite creative.
p38
aVThey've taken things off the shelf.
p39
aa(lp40
VOne of my favorite examples
p41
aVis that of Sir Harold Ridley,
p42
aVwho was a famous ophthalmologist,
p43
aVor at least became a famous ophthalmologist.
p44
aVAnd during World War II, what he would see
p45
aVwould be pilots coming back from their missions,
p46
aVand he noticed that within their eyes
p47
aVthey had shards of small bits of material
p48
aVlodged within the eye,
p49
aVbut the very interesting thing about it
p50
aVwas that material, actually, wasn't causing
p51
aVany inflammatory response.
p52
aVSo he looked into this, and he figured out
p53
aVthat actually that material was little shards of plastic
p54
aVthat were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.
p55
aVAnd this led him to propose that material
p56
aVas a new material for intraocular lenses.
p57
aVIt's called PMMA, and it's now used
p58
aVin millions of people every year
p59
aVand helps in preventing cataracts.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd that example, I think, is a really nice one,
p62
aVbecause it helps remind us that in the early days,
p63
aVpeople often chose materials
p64
aVbecause they were bioinert.
p65
aVTheir very purpose was to  perform a mechanical function.
p66
aVYou'd put them in the body
p67
aVand you wouldn't get an adverse response.
p68
aVAnd what I want to show you is that
p69
aVin regenerative medicine,
p70
aVwe've really shifted away from that idea
p71
aVof taking a bioinert material.
p72
aVWe're actually actively looking for materials
p73
aVthat will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,
p74
aVand that furthermore we can put in the body,
p75
aVthey'll have their function,
p76
aVand then they'll dissolve away over time.
p77
aa(lp78
VIf we look at this schematic,
p79
aVthis is showing you what we think of
p80
aVas the typical tissue-engineering approach.
p81
aVWe have cells there, typically from the patient.
p82
aVWe can put those onto a material,
p83
aVand we can make that material  very complex if we want to,
p84
aVand we can then grow that up in the lab
p85
aVor we can put it straight back into the patient.
p86
aVAnd this is an approach that's  used all over the world,
p87
aVincluding in our lab.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut one of the things that's really important
p90
aVwhen we're thinking about stem cells
p91
aVis that obviously stem cells  can be many different things,
p92
aVand they want to be many different things,
p93
aVand so we want to make sure that the environment
p94
aVwe put them into has enough information
p95
aVso that they can become the right sort
p96
aVof specialist tissue.
p97
aVAnd if we think about the different types of tissues
p98
aVthat people are looking at regenerating
p99
aVall over the world, in all the  different labs in the world,
p100
aVthere's pretty much every tissue you can think of.
p101
aVAnd actually, the structure of those tissues
p102
aVis quite different, and it's going to really depend
p103
aVon whether your patient has any underlying disease,
p104
aVother conditions, in terms of how
p105
aVyou're going to regenerate your tissue,
p106
aVand you're going to need to think about the materials
p107
aVyou're going to use really carefully,
p108
aVtheir biochemistry, their mechanics,
p109
aVand many other properties as well.
p110
aa(lp111
VOur tissues all have very  different abilities to regenerate,
p112
aVand here we see poor Prometheus,
p113
aVwho made a rather tricky career choice
p114
aVand was punished by the Greek gods.
p115
aVHe was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come
p116
aVevery day to eat his liver.
p117
aVBut of course his liver would regenerate every day,
p118
aVand so day after day he was punished
p119
aVfor eternity by the gods.
p120
aVAnd liver will regenerate in this very nice way,
p121
aVbut actually if we think of other tissues,
p122
aVlike cartilage, for example,
p123
aVeven the simplest nick and you're going to find it
p124
aVreally difficult to regenerate your cartilage.
p125
aVSo it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, bone is somewhere in between,
p128
aVand this is one of the tissues  that we work on a lot in our lab.
p129
aVAnd bone is actually quite good at repairing.
p130
aVIt has to be. We've probably all had fractures
p131
aVat some point or other.
p132
aVAnd one of the ways that you can think
p133
aVabout repairing your fracture
p134
aVis this procedure here, called  an iliac crest harvest.
p135
aVAnd what the surgeon might do
p136
aVis take some bone from your iliac crest,
p137
aVwhich is just here,
p138
aVand then transplant that  somewhere else in the body.
p139
aVAnd it actually works really well,
p140
aVbecause it's your own bone,
p141
aVand it's well vascularized,
p142
aVwhich means it's got a really good blood supply.
p143
aVBut the problem is, there's only so much you can take,
p144
aVand also when you do that operation,
p145
aVyour patients might actually have significant pain
p146
aVin that defect site even two  years after the operation.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo what we were thinking is,
p149
aVthere's a tremendous need  for bone repair, of course,
p150
aVbut this iliac crest-type approach
p151
aVreally has a lot of limitations to it,
p152
aVand could we perhaps recreate
p153
aVthe generation of bone within the body
p154
aVon demand and then be able to transplant it
p155
aVwithout these very, very painful aftereffects
p156
aVthat you would have with the iliac crest harvest?
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd so this is what we did, and the way we did it
p159
aVwas by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach
p160
aVbut actually thinking about it rather differently.
p161
aVAnd we simplified it a lot,
p162
aVso we got rid of a lot of these steps.
p163
aVWe got rid of the need to  harvest cells from the patient,
p164
aVwe got rid of the need to put  in really fancy chemistries,
p165
aVand we got rid of the need
p166
aVto culture these scaffolds in the lab.
p167
aVAnd what we really focused on
p168
aVwas our material system and making it quite simple,
p169
aVbut because we used it in a really clever way,
p170
aVwe were able to generate enormous amounts of bone
p171
aVusing this approach.
p172
aVSo we were using the body
p173
aVas really the catalyst to help us
p174
aVto make lots of new bone.
p175
aVAnd it's an approach that we call
p176
aVthe in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make
p177
aVenormous amounts of bone using this approach.
p178
aVAnd I'll talk you through this.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo what we do is,
p181
aVin humans, we all have a layer of stem cells
p182
aVon the outside of our long bones.
p183
aVThat layer is called the periosteum.
p184
aVAnd that layer is actually normally
p185
aVvery, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,
p186
aVand it's got stem cells in it.
p187
aVThose stem cells are really important
p188
aVin the embryo when it develops,
p189
aVand they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture
p190
aVto help you with repairing the bone.
p191
aVSo we take that periosteum layer
p192
aVand we developed a way to inject underneath it
p193
aVa liquid that then, within 30 seconds,
p194
aVwould turn into quite a rigid gel
p195
aVand can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone.
p196
aVSo it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity
p197
aVthat is right next to both the bone
p198
aVbut also this really rich layer of stem cells.
p199
aVAnd we go in through a pinhole incision
p200
aVso that no other cells from the body can get in,
p201
aVand what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity
p202
aVcan then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,
p203
aVand they can form lots of new tissue,
p204
aVand then over time, you can harvest that tissue
p205
aVand use it elsewhere in the body.
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is a histology slide
p208
aVof what we see when we do that,
p209
aVand essentially what we see
p210
aVis very large amounts of bone.
p211
aVSo in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,
p212
aVso the bone marrow,
p213
aVthen you can see the original bone,
p214
aVand you can see where that original bone finishes,
p215
aVand just to the left of that is the new bone
p216
aVthat's grown within that bioreactor cavity,
p217
aVand you can actually make it even larger.
p218
aVAnd that demarcation that you can see
p219
aVbetween the original bone and the new bone
p220
aVacts as a very slight point of weakness,
p221
aVso actually now the surgeon can come along,
p222
aVcan harvest away that new bone,
p223
aVand the periosteum can grow back,
p224
aVso you're left with the leg
p225
aVin the same sort of state
p226
aVas if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.
p227
aVSo it's very, very low in terms of after-pain
p228
aVcompared to an iliac crest harvest.
p229
aVAnd you can grow different amounts of bone
p230
aVdepending on how much gel you put in there,
p231
aVso it really is an on demand sort of procedure.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, at the time that we did this,
p234
aVthis received a lot of attention in the press,
p235
aVbecause it was a really nice way
p236
aVof generating new bone,
p237
aVand we got many, many contacts
p238
aVfrom different people that  were interested in using this.
p239
aVAnd I'm just going to tell you,
p240
aVsometimes those contacts are very strange,
p241
aVslightly unexpected,
p242
aVand the very most interesting,
p243
aVlet me put it that way, contact that I had,
p244
aVwas actually from a team of American footballers
p245
aVthat all wanted to have double-thickness skulls
p246
aVmade on their head.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd so you do get these kinds of contacts,
p249
aVand of course, being British
p250
aVand also growing up in France,
p251
aVI tend to be very blunt,
p252
aVand so I had to explain to them very nicely
p253
aVthat in their particular case,
p254
aVthere probably wasn't that much in there
p255
aVto protect in the first place.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VSo this was our approach,
p262
aVand it was simple materials,
p263
aVbut we thought about it carefully.
p264
aVAnd actually we know that those cells
p265
aVin the body, in the embryo, as they develop
p266
aVcan form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,
p267
aVand so we developed a gel that was slightly different
p268
aVin nature and slightly different chemistry,
p269
aVput it in there, and we were able to get
p270
aV100 percent cartilage instead.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd this approach works really well, I think,
p273
aVfor pre-planned procedures,
p274
aVbut it's something you do have to pre-plan.
p275
aVSo for other kinds of operations,
p276
aVthere's definitely a need for other
p277
aVscaffold-based approaches.
p278
aVAnd when you think about designing
p279
aVthose other scaffolds, actually,
p280
aVyou need a really multi-disciplinary team.
p281
aVAnd so our team has chemists,
p282
aVit has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,
p283
aVand those people all come together
p284
aVand we think really hard about  designing the materials.
p285
aa(lp286
VBut we want to make them have enough information
p287
aVthat we can get the cells to do what we want,
p288
aVbut not be so complex as to make it difficult
p289
aVto get to clinic.
p290
aVAnd so one of the things we think about a lot
p291
aVis really trying to understand
p292
aVthe structure of the tissues in the body.
p293
aVAnd so if we think of bone,
p294
aVobviously my own favorite tissue,
p295
aVwe zoom in, we can see,
p296
aVeven if you don't know anything  about bone structure,
p297
aVit's beautifully organized,  really beautifully organized.
p298
aVWe've lots of blood vessels in there.
p299
aVAnd if we zoom in again, we see that the cells
p300
aVare actually surrounded by a 3D matrix
p301
aVof nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot
p302
aVof information to the cells.
p303
aVAnd if we zoom in again,
p304
aVactually in the case of bone, the matrix
p305
aVaround the cells is beautifully organized
p306
aVat the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material
p307
aVthat's part organic, part inorganic.
p308
aVAnd that's led to a whole field, really,
p309
aVthat has looked at developing materials
p310
aVthat have this hybrid kind of structure.
p311
aVAnd so I'm showing here just two examples
p312
aVwhere we've made some materials that have that sort of structure,
p313
aVand you can really tailor it.
p314
aVYou can see here a very squishy one
p315
aVand now a material that's also  this hybrid sort of material
p316
aVbut actually has remarkable toughness,
p317
aVand it's no longer brittle.
p318
aVAnd an inorganic material  would normally be really brittle,
p319
aVand you wouldn't be able to have
p320
aVthat sort of strength and toughness in it.
p321
aa(lp322
VOne other thing I want to quickly mention is that
p323
aVmany of the scaffolds we make  are porous, and they have to be,
p324
aVbecause you want blood vessels to grow in there.
p325
aVBut the pores are actually oftentimes
p326
aVmuch bigger than the cells,
p327
aVand so even though it's 3D,
p328
aVthe cell might see it more  as a slightly curved surface,
p329
aVand that's a little bit unnatural.
p330
aVAnd so one of the things you can think about doing
p331
aVis actually making scaffolds  with slightly different dimensions
p332
aVthat might be able to surround your cells in 3D
p333
aVand give them a little bit more information.
p334
aVAnd there's a lot of work going  on in both of these areas.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow finally, I just want to talk a little bit about
p337
aVapplying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,
p338
aVbecause this is a really big clinical problem.
p339
aVAnd one of the things that we know is that,
p340
aVunfortunately, if you have a heart attack,
p341
aVthen that tissue can start to die,
p342
aVand your outcome may not be very good over time.
p343
aVAnd it would be really great, actually,
p344
aVif we could stop that dead tissue
p345
aVeither from dying or help it to regenerate.
p346
aVAnd there's lots and lots of stem  cell trials going on worldwide,
p347
aVand they use many different types of cells,
p348
aVbut one common theme that seems to be coming out
p349
aVis that actually, very often, those cells will die
p350
aVonce you've implanted them.
p351
aVAnd you can either put them into the heart
p352
aVor into the blood system,
p353
aVbut either way, we don't seem to be able
p354
aVto get quite the right number of cells
p355
aVgetting to the location we want them to
p356
aVand being able to deliver the sort of beautiful
p357
aVcell regeneration that we would like to have
p358
aVto get good clinical outcomes.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd so some of the things that we're thinking of,
p361
aVand many other people in the field are thinking of,
p362
aVare actually developing materials for that.
p363
aVBut there's a difference here.
p364
aVWe still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,
p365
aVwe still need really interesting topography,
p366
aVand we still need really interesting  ways to surround the cells.
p367
aVBut now, the cells also
p368
aVwould probably quite like a material
p369
aVthat's going to be able to be conductive,
p370
aVbecause the cells themselves will respond very well
p371
aVand will actually conduct signals  between themselves.
p372
aVYou can see them now
p373
aVbeating synchronously on these materials,
p374
aVand that's a very, very exciting development
p375
aVthat's going on.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that
p378
aVbeing able to work in this sort of field,
p379
aVall of us that work in this field
p380
aVthat's not only super-exciting science,
p381
aVbut also has the potential
p382
aVto impact on patients,
p383
aVhowever big or small they are,
p384
aVis really a great privilege.
p385
aVAnd so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.
p386
aa(lp387
VThank you.
