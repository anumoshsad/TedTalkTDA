VImagine if you could record your life \u2014
p4
aVeverything you said, everything you did,
p5
aVavailable in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,
p6
aVso you could go back
p7
aVand find memorable moments and relive them,
p8
aVor sift through traces of time
p9
aVand discover patterns in your own life
p10
aVthat previously had gone undiscovered.
p11
aVWell that's exactly the journey
p12
aVthat my family began
p13
aVfive and a half years ago.
p14
aVThis is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.
p15
aVAnd on this day, at this moment,
p16
aVwe walked into the house with our first child,
p17
aVour beautiful baby boy.
p18
aVAnd we walked into a house
p19
aVwith a very special home video recording system.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Video) Man: Okay.
p22
aa(lp23
VDeb Roy: This moment
p24
aVand thousands of other moments special for us
p25
aVwere captured in our home
p26
aVbecause in every room in the house,
p27
aVif you looked up, you'd see a camera and a microphone,
p28
aVand if you looked down,
p29
aVyou'd get this bird's-eye view of the room.
p30
aVHere's our living room,
p31
aVthe baby bedroom,
p32
aVkitchen, dining room
p33
aVand the rest of the house.
p34
aVAnd all of these fed into a disc array
p35
aVthat was designed for a continuous capture.
p36
aVSo here we are flying through a day in our home
p37
aVas we move from sunlit morning
p38
aVthrough incandescent evening
p39
aVand, finally, lights out for the day.
p40
aVOver the course of three years,
p41
aVwe recorded eight to 10 hours a day,
p42
aVamassing roughly a quarter-million hours
p43
aVof multi-track audio and video.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo you're looking at a piece of what is by far
p46
aVthe largest home video collection ever made.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVAnd what this data represents
p49
aVfor our family at a personal level,
p50
aVthe impact has already been immense,
p51
aVand we're still learning its value.
p52
aVCountless moments
p53
aVof unsolicited natural moments, not posed moments,
p54
aVare captured there,
p55
aVand we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut there's also a scientific reason that drove this project,
p58
aVwhich was to use this natural longitudinal data
p59
aVto understand the process
p60
aVof how a child learns language \u2014
p61
aVthat child being my son.
p62
aVAnd so with many privacy provisions put in place
p63
aVto protect everyone who was recorded in the data,
p64
aVwe made elements of the data available
p65
aVto my trusted research team at MIT
p66
aVso we could start teasing apart patterns
p67
aVin this massive data set,
p68
aVtrying to understand the influence of social environments
p69
aVon language acquisition.
p70
aVSo we're looking here
p71
aVat one of the first things we started to do.
p72
aVThis is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen,
p73
aVand as we move through space and through time,
p74
aVa very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn order to convert
p77
aVthis opaque, 90,000 hours of video
p78
aVinto something that we could start to see,
p79
aVwe use motion analysis to pull out,
p80
aVas we move through space and through time,
p81
aVwhat we call space-time worms.
p82
aVAnd this has become part of our toolkit
p83
aVfor being able to look and see
p84
aVwhere the activities are in the data,
p85
aVand with it, trace the pattern of, in particular,
p86
aVwhere my son moved throughout the home,
p87
aVso that we could focus our transcription efforts,
p88
aVall of the speech environment around my son \u2014
p89
aVall of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny,
p90
aVand over time, the words he began to produce.
p91
aVSo with that technology and that data
p92
aVand the ability to, with machine assistance,
p93
aVtranscribe speech,
p94
aVwe've now transcribed
p95
aVwell over seven million words of our home transcripts.
p96
aVAnd with that, let me take you now
p97
aVfor a first tour into the data.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo you've all, I'm sure,
p100
aVseen time-lapse videos
p101
aVwhere a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.
p102
aVI'd like you to now experience
p103
aVthe blossoming of a speech form.
p104
aVMy son, soon after his first birthday,
p105
aVwould say "gaga" to mean water.
p106
aVAnd over the course of the next half-year,
p107
aVhe slowly learned to approximate
p108
aVthe proper adult form, "water."
p109
aVSo we're going to cruise through half a year
p110
aVin about 40 seconds.
p111
aVNo video here,
p112
aVso you can focus on the sound, the acoustics,
p113
aVof a new kind of trajectory:
p114
aVgaga to water.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Audio) Baby: Gagagagagaga
p117
aVGaga gaga gaga
p118
aVguga guga guga
p119
aVwada gaga gaga guga gaga
p120
aVwader guga guga
p121
aVwater water water
p122
aVwater water water
p123
aVwater water
p124
aVwater.
p125
aa(lp126
VDR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo he didn't just learn water.
p131
aVOver the course of the 24 months,
p132
aVthe first two years that we really focused on,
p133
aVthis is a map of every word he learned in chronological order.
p134
aVAnd because we have full transcripts,
p135
aVwe've identified each of the 503 words
p136
aVthat he learned to produce by his second birthday.
p137
aVHe was an early talker.
p138
aVAnd so we started to analyze why.
p139
aVWhy were certain words born before others?
p140
aVThis is one of the first results
p141
aVthat came out of our study a little over a year ago
p142
aVthat really surprised us.
p143
aVThe way to interpret this apparently simple graph
p144
aVis, on the vertical is an indication
p145
aVof how complex caregiver utterances are
p146
aVbased on the length of utterances.
p147
aVAnd the [horizontal] axis is time.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd all of the data,
p150
aVwe aligned based on the following idea:
p151
aVEvery time my son would learn a word,
p152
aVwe would trace back and look at all of the language he heard
p153
aVthat contained that word.
p154
aVAnd we would plot the relative length of the utterances.
p155
aVAnd what we found was this curious phenomena,
p156
aVthat caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum,
p157
aVmaking language as simple as possible,
p158
aVand then slowly ascend back up in complexity.
p159
aVAnd the amazing thing was
p160
aVthat bounce, that dip,
p161
aVlined up almost precisely
p162
aVwith when each word was born \u2014
p163
aVword after word, systematically.
p164
aVSo it appears that all three primary caregivers \u2014
p165
aVmyself, my wife and our nanny \u2014
p166
aVwere systematically and, I would think, subconsciously
p167
aVrestructuring our language
p168
aVto meet him at the birth of a word
p169
aVand bring him gently into more complex language.
p170
aVAnd the implications of this \u2014 there are many,
p171
aVbut one I just want to point out,
p172
aVis that there must be amazing feedback loops.
p173
aVOf course, my son is learning
p174
aVfrom his linguistic environment,
p175
aVbut the environment is learning from him.
p176
aVThat environment, people, are in these tight feedback loops
p177
aVand creating a kind of scaffolding
p178
aVthat has not been noticed until now.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut that's looking at the speech context.
p181
aVWhat about the visual context?
p182
aVWe're not looking at \u2014
p183
aVthink of this as a dollhouse cutaway of our house.
p184
aVWe've taken those circular fish-eye lens cameras,
p185
aVand we've done some optical correction,
p186
aVand then we can bring it into three-dimensional life.
p187
aVSo welcome to my home.
p188
aVThis is a moment,
p189
aVone moment captured across multiple cameras.
p190
aVThe reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine,
p191
aVwhere you can go back and interactively fly around
p192
aVand then breathe video-life into this system.
p193
aVWhat I'm going to do
p194
aVis give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes,
p195
aVagain, of just life in the living room.
p196
aVThat's me and my son on the floor.
p197
aVAnd there's video analytics
p198
aVthat are tracking our movements.
p199
aVMy son is leaving red ink. I am leaving green ink.
p200
aVWe're now on the couch,
p201
aVlooking out through the window at cars passing by.
p202
aVAnd finally, my son playing in a walking toy by himself.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow we freeze the action, 30 minutes,
p205
aVwe turn time into the vertical axis,
p206
aVand we open up for a view
p207
aVof these interaction traces we've just left behind.
p208
aVAnd we see these amazing structures \u2014
p209
aVthese little knots of two colors of thread
p210
aVwe call "social hot spots."
p211
aVThe spiral thread
p212
aVwe call a "solo hot spot."
p213
aVAnd we think that these affect the way language is learned.
p214
aVWhat we'd like to do
p215
aVis start understanding
p216
aVthe interaction between these patterns
p217
aVand the language that my son is exposed to
p218
aVto see if we can predict
p219
aVhow the structure of when words are heard
p220
aVaffects when they're learned \u2014
p221
aVso in other words, the relationship
p222
aVbetween words and what they're about in the world.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo here's how we're approaching this.
p225
aVIn this video,
p226
aVagain, my son is being traced out.
p227
aVHe's leaving red ink behind.
p228
aVAnd there's our nanny by the door.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Video) Nanny: You want water? (Baby: Aaaa.)
p231
aVNanny: All right. (Baby: Aaaa.)
p232
aa(lp233
VDR: She offers water,
p234
aVand off go the two worms
p235
aVover to the kitchen to get water.
p236
aVAnd what we've done is use the word "water"
p237
aVto tag that moment, that bit of activity.
p238
aVAnd now we take the power of data
p239
aVand take every time my son
p240
aVever heard the word water
p241
aVand the context he saw it in,
p242
aVand we use it to penetrate through the video
p243
aVand find every activity trace
p244
aVthat co-occurred with an instance of water.
p245
aVAnd what this data leaves in its wake
p246
aVis a landscape.
p247
aVWe call these wordscapes.
p248
aVThis is the wordscape for the word water,
p249
aVand you can see most of the action is in the kitchen.
p250
aVThat's where those big peaks are over to the left.
p251
aVAnd just for contrast, we can do this with any word.
p252
aVWe can take the word "bye"
p253
aVas in "good bye."
p254
aVAnd we're now zoomed in over the entrance to the house.
p255
aVAnd we look, and we find, as you would expect,
p256
aVa contrast in the landscape
p257
aVwhere the word "bye" occurs much more in a structured way.
p258
aVSo we're using these structures
p259
aVto start predicting
p260
aVthe order of language acquisition,
p261
aVand that's ongoing work now.
p262
aa(lp263
VIn my lab, which we're peering into now, at MIT \u2014
p264
aVthis is at the media lab.
p265
aVThis has become my favorite way
p266
aVof videographing just about any space.
p267
aVThree of the key people in this project,
p268
aVPhilip DeCamp, Rony Kubat and Brandon Roy are pictured here.
p269
aVPhilip has been a close collaborator
p270
aVon all the visualizations you're seeing.
p271
aVAnd Michael Fleischman
p272
aVwas another Ph.D. student in my lab
p273
aVwho worked with me on this home video analysis,
p274
aVand he made the following observation:
p275
aVthat "just the way that we're analyzing
p276
aVhow language connects to events
p277
aVwhich provide common ground for language,
p278
aVthat same idea we can take out of your home, Deb,
p279
aVand we can apply it to the world of public media."
p280
aVAnd so our effort took an unexpected turn.
p281
aa(lp282
VThink of mass media
p283
aVas providing common ground
p284
aVand you have the recipe
p285
aVfor taking this idea to a whole new place.
p286
aVWe've started analyzing television content
p287
aVusing the same principles \u2014
p288
aVanalyzing event structure of a TV signal \u2014
p289
aVepisodes of shows,
p290
aVcommercials,
p291
aVall of the components that make up the event structure.
p292
aVAnd we're now, with satellite dishes, pulling and analyzing
p293
aVa good part of all the TV being watched in the United States.
p294
aVAnd you don't have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones
p295
aVto get people's conversations,
p296
aVyou just tune into publicly available social media feeds.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo we're pulling in
p299
aVabout three billion comments a month,
p300
aVand then the magic happens.
p301
aVYou have the event structure,
p302
aVthe common ground that the words are about,
p303
aVcoming out of the television feeds;
p304
aVyou've got the conversations
p305
aVthat are about those topics;
p306
aVand through semantic analysis \u2014
p307
aVand this is actually real data you're looking at
p308
aVfrom our data processing \u2014
p309
aVeach yellow line is showing a link being made
p310
aVbetween a comment in the wild
p311
aVand a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal.
p312
aVAnd the same idea now
p313
aVcan be built up.
p314
aVAnd we get this wordscape,
p315
aVexcept now words are not assembled in my living room.
p316
aVInstead, the context, the common ground activities,
p317
aVare the content on television that's driving the conversations.
p318
aVAnd what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now,
p319
aVare commentary
p320
aVthat are linked to content on television.
p321
aVSame concept,
p322
aVbut looking at communication dynamics
p323
aVin a very different sphere.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd so fundamentally, rather than, for example,
p326
aVmeasuring content based on how many people are watching,
p327
aVthis gives us the basic data
p328
aVfor looking at engagement properties of content.
p329
aVAnd just like we can look at feedback cycles
p330
aVand dynamics in a family,
p331
aVwe can now open up the same concepts
p332
aVand look at much larger groups of people.
p333
aVThis is a subset of data from our database \u2014
p334
aVjust 50,000 out of several million \u2014
p335
aVand the social graph that connects them
p336
aVthrough publicly available sources.
p337
aVAnd if you put them on one plain,
p338
aVa second plain is where the content lives.
p339
aVSo we have the programs
p340
aVand the sporting events
p341
aVand the commercials,
p342
aVand all of the link structures that tie them together
p343
aVmake a content graph.
p344
aVAnd then the important third dimension.
p345
aVEach of the links that you're seeing rendered here
p346
aVis an actual connection made
p347
aVbetween something someone said
p348
aVand a piece of content.
p349
aVAnd there are, again, now tens of millions of these links
p350
aVthat give us the connective tissue of social graphs
p351
aVand how they relate to content.
p352
aVAnd we can now start to probe the structure
p353
aVin interesting ways.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo if we, for example, trace the path
p356
aVof one piece of content
p357
aVthat drives someone to comment on it,
p358
aVand then we follow where that comment goes,
p359
aVand then look at the entire social graph that becomes activated
p360
aVand then trace back to see the relationship
p361
aVbetween that social graph and content,
p362
aVa very interesting structure becomes visible.
p363
aVWe call this a co-viewing clique,
p364
aVa virtual living room if you will.
p365
aVAnd there are fascinating dynamics at play.
p366
aVIt's not one way.
p367
aVA piece of content, an event, causes someone to talk.
p368
aVThey talk to other people.
p369
aVThat drives tune-in behavior back into mass media,
p370
aVand you have these cycles
p371
aVthat drive the overall behavior.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnother example \u2014 very different \u2014
p374
aVanother actual person in our database \u2014
p375
aVand we're finding at least hundreds, if not thousands, of these.
p376
aVWe've given this person a name.
p377
aVThis is a pro-amateur, or pro-am media critic
p378
aVwho has this high fan-out rate.
p379
aVSo a lot of people are following this person \u2014 very influential \u2014
p380
aVand they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV.
p381
aVSo this person is a key link
p382
aVin connecting mass media and social media together.
p383
aa(lp384
VOne last example from this data:
p385
aVSometimes it's actually a piece of content that is special.
p386
aVSo if we go and look at this piece of content,
p387
aVPresident Obama's State of the Union address
p388
aVfrom just a few weeks ago,
p389
aVand look at what we find in this same data set,
p390
aVat the same scale,
p391
aVthe engagement properties of this piece of content
p392
aVare truly remarkable.
p393
aVA nation exploding in conversation
p394
aVin real time
p395
aVin response to what's on the broadcast.
p396
aVAnd of course, through all of these lines
p397
aVare flowing unstructured language.
p398
aVWe can X-ray
p399
aVand get a real-time pulse of a nation,
p400
aVreal-time sense
p401
aVof the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph
p402
aVbeing activated by content.
p403
aa(lp404
VSo, to summarize, the idea is this:
p405
aVAs our world becomes increasingly instrumented
p406
aVand we have the capabilities
p407
aVto collect and connect the dots
p408
aVbetween what people are saying
p409
aVand the context they're saying it in,
p410
aVwhat's emerging is an ability
p411
aVto see new social structures and dynamics
p412
aVthat have previously not been seen.
p413
aVIt's like building a microscope or telescope
p414
aVand revealing new structures
p415
aVabout our own behavior around communication.
p416
aVAnd I think the implications here are profound,
p417
aVwhether it's for science,
p418
aVfor commerce, for government,
p419
aVor perhaps most of all,
p420
aVfor us as individuals.
p421
aa(lp422
VAnd so just to return to my son,
p423
aVwhen I was preparing this talk, he was looking over my shoulder,
p424
aVand I showed him the clips I was going to show to you today,
p425
aVand I asked him for permission \u2014 granted.
p426
aVAnd then I went on to reflect,
p427
aV"Isn't it amazing,
p428
aVthis entire database, all these recordings,
p429
aVI'm going to hand off to you and to your sister" \u2014
p430
aVwho arrived two years later \u2014
p431
aV"and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments
p432
aVthat you could never, with your biological memory,
p433
aVpossibly remember the way you can now?"
p434
aVAnd he was quiet for a moment.
p435
aVAnd I thought, "What am I thinking?
p436
aVHe's five years old. He's not going to understand this."
p437
aVAnd just as I was having that thought, he looked up at me and said,
p438
aV"So that when I grow up,
p439
aVI can show this to my kids?"
p440
aVAnd I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."
p441
aa(lp442
VSo I want to leave you
p443
aVwith one last memorable moment
p444
aVfrom our family.
p445
aVThis is the first time our son
p446
aVtook more than two steps at once \u2014
p447
aVcaptured on film.
p448
aVAnd I really want you to focus on something
p449
aVas I take you through.
p450
aVIt's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.
p451
aVMy mother's in the kitchen, cooking,
p452
aVand, of all places, in the hallway,
p453
aVI realize he's about to do it, about to take more than two steps.
p454
aVAnd so you hear me encouraging him,
p455
aVrealizing what's happening,
p456
aVand then the magic happens.
p457
aVListen very carefully.
p458
aVAbout three steps in,
p459
aVhe realizes something magic is happening,
p460
aVand the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in,
p461
aVand he takes a breath in,
p462
aVand he whispers "wow"
p463
aVand instinctively I echo back the same.
p464
aVAnd so let's fly back in time
p465
aVto that memorable moment.
p466
aa(lp467
V(Video) DR: Hey.
p468
aVCome here.
p469
aVCan you do it?
p470
aVOh, boy.
p471
aVCan you do it?
p472
aVBaby: Yeah.
p473
aVDR: Ma, he's walking.
