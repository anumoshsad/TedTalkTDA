(lp3
VI'm not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum
p4
aVat nine o'clock or so in the morning.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VBut anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater,
p9
aVand really, I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues
p10
aVfor such a great presentation.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Applause)
p13
aa(lp14
VOne of the interesting things, of course,
p15
aVis the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology,
p16
aVand what he said about listening to our young people.
p17
aa(lp18
VOf course, my job is all about listening.
p19
aVAnd my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.
p20
aVThat's my only real aim in life.
p21
aVAnd it sounds quite simple, but actually, it's quite a big, big job.
p22
aVBecause you know, when you look at a piece of music, for example,
p23
aVif I just open my little motorbike bag \u2014
p24
aVwe have here, hopefully,
p25
aVa piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page.
p26
aVAnd, you know, we open it up ...
p27
aVAnd I read the music.
p28
aVSo technically, I can actually read this.
p29
aVI will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.
p30
aVI will do exactly as I'm told.
p31
aVAnd so therefore, because time is short,
p32
aVif I just played you, literally, the first, maybe, two lines or so \u2014
p33
aVIt's very straightforward; there's nothing too difficult about the piece.
p34
aVBut here, I'm being told that the piece of music is very quick.
p35
aVI'm being told where to play on the drum.
p36
aVI'm being told which part of the stick to use.
p37
aVAnd I'm being told the dynamic.
p38
aVAnd I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.
p39
aVSnares on, snares off.
p40
aVSo therefore, if I translate this piece of music,
p41
aVwe have this idea.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Drum sounds)
p44
aa(lp45
V(Drum sounds end)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd so on.
p48
aVMy career would probably last about five years.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VHowever, what I have to do as a musician
p53
aVis do everything that is not on the music;
p54
aVeverything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher,
p55
aVor to talk about, even, from a teacher.
p56
aVBut it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument
p57
aVthat, in fact, become so interesting, and that you want to explore
p58
aVthrough this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.
p59
aVSo there, we experience the translation.
p60
aVNow we'll experience the interpretation.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Drum sounds)
p63
aa(lp64
V(Drum sounds end)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VNow my career may last a little longer.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VBut in a way, you know, it's the same if I look at you
p73
aVand I see a nice, bright young lady with a pink top on.
p74
aVI see that you're clutching a teddy bear, etc., etc.
p75
aVSo I get a basic idea as to what you might be about,
p76
aVwhat you might like, what you might do as a profession, etc., etc.
p77
aVHowever, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get
p78
aVwhen we actually look and we try to interpret.
p79
aVBut actually it's so unbelievably shallow.
p80
aVIn the same way, I look at the music; I get a basic idea;
p81
aVI wonder what technically might be hard, or, you know, what I want to do.
p82
aVJust the basic feeling.
p83
aa(lp84
VHowever, that is simply not enough.
p85
aVAnd I think what Herbie said: please listen, listen.
p86
aVWe have to listen to ourselves, first of all.
p87
aVIf I play, for example, holding the stick \u2014
p88
aVwhere literally I do not let go of the stick \u2014
p89
aa(lp90
V(Drum sound)
p91
aa(lp92
Vyou'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.
p93
aVAnd you feel really quite \u2014 believe it or not \u2014
p94
aVdetached from the instrument and from the stick,
p95
aVeven though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Drum sound)
p98
aa(lp99
VBy holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.
p100
aVIf I just simply let go
p101
aVand allow my hand, my arm, to be more of a support system,
p102
aVsuddenly \u2014
p103
aa(lp104
V(Drum sound)
p105
aa(lp106
VI have more dynamic with less effort.
p107
aVMuch more \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Drum sound)
p110
aa(lp111
Vand I just feel, at last, one with the stick
p112
aVand one with the drum.
p113
aVAnd I'm doing far, far less.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo in the same way that I need time with this instrument,
p116
aVI need time with people in order to interpret them.
p117
aVNot just translate them, but interpret them.
p118
aVIf, for example, I play just a few bars of a piece of music
p119
aVfor which I think of myself as a technician \u2014
p120
aVthat is, someone who is basically a percussion player \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Marimba sounds)
p123
aa(lp124
V(Marimba sounds end)
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd so on, if I think of myself as a musician \u2014
p127
aa(lp128
V(Marimba sounds)
p129
aa(lp130
V(Marimba sounds end)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd so on.
p133
aVThere is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just \u2014
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
Vthinking about.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd I remember when I was 12 years old,
p140
aVand I started playing timpani and percussion,
p141
aVand my teacher said,
p142
aV"Well, how are we going to do this? You know, music is about listening."
p143
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I agree with that, so what's the problem?"
p144
aVAnd he said, "Well, how are you going to hear this?
p145
aVHow are you going to hear that?"
p146
aVAnd I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"
p147
aVHe said, "Well, I think I hear it through here."
p148
aVAnd I said, "Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands,
p149
aVthrough my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,
p150
aVmy tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd so we began our lessons every single time
p153
aVtuning drums, in particular, the kettle drums, or timpani
p154
aVto such a narrow pitch interval, so something like \u2014
p155
aa(lp156
V(Marimba sounds)
p157
aa(lp158
Vthat of a difference.
p159
aVThen gradually:
p160
aa(lp161
V(Marimba sounds)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd gradually:
p164
aa(lp165
V(Marimba sounds)
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd it's amazing that when you do open your body up,
p168
aVand open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,
p169
aVthat in fact the tiny, tiny difference \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Marimba sounds)
p172
aa(lp173
Vcan be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger, there.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd so what we would do is that I would put my hands
p176
aVon the wall of the music room,
p177
aVand together, we would "listen" to the sounds of the instruments,
p178
aVand really try to connect with those sounds
p179
aVfar, far more broadly than simply depending on the ear.
p180
aVBecause of course, the ear is subject to all sorts of things.
p181
aVThe room we happen to be in, the amplification,
p182
aVthe quality of the instrument, the type of sticks \u2014
p183
aa(lp184
V(Marimba sounds)
p185
aa(lp186
V(Marimba sounds end)
p187
aa(lp188
VEtc., etc., they're all different.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Marimba sounds)
p191
aa(lp192
V(Marimba sounds end)
p193
aa(lp194
VSame amount of weight, but different sound colors.
p195
aVAnd that's basically what we are; we're just human beings,
p196
aVbut we all have our own little sound colors, as it were,
p197
aVthat make up these extraordinary personalities and characters
p198
aVand interests and things.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd as I grew older, I then auditioned
p201
aVfor the Royal Academy of Music in London,
p202
aVand they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue,
p203
aVyou know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"
p204
aVAnd I just couldn't quite accept that.
p205
aVAnd so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse \u2014
p206
aVif you refuse me through those reasons,
p207
aVas opposed to the ability to perform
p208
aVand to understand and love the art of creating sound \u2014
p209
aVthen we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."
p210
aVAnd as a result, once we got over a little hurdle,
p211
aVand having to audition twice,
p212
aVthey accepted me.
p213
aVAnd not only that,
p214
aVwhat had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions
p215
aVthroughout the United Kingdom.
p216
aa(lp217
VUnder no circumstances were they to refuse
p218
aVany application whatsoever
p219
aVon the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs \u2014
p220
aVthey could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.
p221
aVNo circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry.
p222
aVAnd every single entry had to be listened to, experienced,
p223
aVand then, based on the musical ability,
p224
aVthen that person could either enter or not.
p225
aVAnd so therefore, this in turn meant
p226
aVthat there was an extremely interesting bunch of students
p227
aVwho arrived in these various music institutions,
p228
aVand I have to say, many of them now in the professional orchestras
p229
aVthroughout the world.
p230
aVThe interesting thing about this as well, though \u2014
p231
aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
Vis quite simply that not only were people connected with sound \u2014
p235
aVwhich is basically all of us \u2014
p236
aVwe well know that music really is our daily medicine.
p237
aa(lp238
VI say "music," but actually I mean "sound."
p239
aVBecause some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician \u2014
p240
aVwhen you may have a 15-year-old lad
p241
aVwho has got the most incredible challenges,
p242
aVwho may not be able to control his movements,
p243
aVwho may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. \u2014
p244
aVsuddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,
p245
aVand perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,
p246
aVand you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost \u2014
p247
aVI don't really have the right sticks, perhaps \u2014
p248
aVbut something like this \u2014 let me change \u2014
p249
aa(lp250
V(Soft marimba sounds)
p251
aa(lp252
V(Soft marimba sounds end)
p253
aa(lp254
VSomething that's so unbelievably simple \u2014
p255
aVbut he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be,
p256
aVbecause I'm on top of the sound.
p257
aVI have the sound coming this way.
p258
aVHe would have the sound coming through the resonators.
p259
aVIf there were no resonators on here, we would have:
p260
aa(lp261
V(Marimba sounds)
p262
aa(lp263
VSo he would have a fullness of sound
p264
aVthat those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience,
p265
aVthose of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience, either.
p266
aVEvery single one of us, depending on where we're sitting,
p267
aVwill experience this sound quite, quite differently.
p268
aVAnd of course, being the participator of the sound,
p269
aVand that is, starting from the idea of what type of sound
p270
aVI want to produce, for example, this sound:
p271
aa(lp272
V(No sound)
p273
aa(lp274
VCan you hear anything?
p275
aVExactly \u2014 because I'm not even touching it.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VBut yet, we get the sensation of something happening.
p280
aVIn the same way that when I see a tree moves,
p281
aVthen I imagine that tree making a rustling sound.
p282
aVDo you see what I mean?
p283
aVWhatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.
p284
aVSo there's always, always that huge \u2014
p285
aVI mean, just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience,
p288
aVand not by learning a piece of music,
p289
aVputting on someone else's interpretation of it,
p290
aVbuying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music,
p291
aVand so on and so forth,
p292
aVbecause that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic,
p293
aVand something that I can fully experience the journey of.
p294
aVSo it may be that, in certain halls,
p295
aVthis dynamic may well work.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Soft marimba sounds)
p298
aa(lp299
V(Soft marimba sounds end)
p300
aa(lp301
VIt may be that in other halls,
p302
aVthey're simply not going to experience that at all,
p303
aVand so therefore, my level of soft, gentle playing may have to be \u2014
p304
aa(lp305
V(Marimba sounds)
p306
aa(lp307
V(Marimba sounds end)
p308
aa(lp309
VDo you see what I mean?
p310
aVSo, because of this explosion in access to sound,
p311
aVespecially through the Deaf community,
p312
aVthis has not only affected how music institutions,
p313
aVhow schools for the deaf treat sound, and not just as a means of therapy \u2014
p314
aValthough, of course, being a participator of music,
p315
aVthat definitely is the case as well \u2014
p316
aVbut it's meant that acousticians have had to really think
p317
aVabout the types of halls they put together.
p318
aVThere are so few halls in this world
p319
aVthat actually have very good acoustics, dare I say.
p320
aVBut by that I mean, where you can absolutely do anything you imagine.
p321
aVThe tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad,
p322
aVso huge, so incredible.
p323
aVThere's always something:
p324
aVit may sound good up there, may not be so good there;
p325
aVit may be great there, but terrible up there;
p326
aVmaybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo to find an actual hall is incredible \u2014
p329
aVfor which you can play exactly what you imagine,
p330
aVwithout it being cosmetically enhanced.
p331
aVSo therefore, acousticians are actually in conversation
p332
aVwith people who are hearing impaired,
p333
aVand who are participators of sound.
p334
aVAnd this is quite interesting.
p335
aVI cannot give you any detail
p336
aVas far as what is actually happening with those halls,
p337
aVbut it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people
p338
aVfor whom so many years, we've been saying,
p339
aV"Well, how on earth can they experience music? They're deaf."
p340
aVWe go like that, and we imagine that's what deafness is about.
p341
aVOr we go like that, and we imagine that's what blindness is about.
p342
aVIf we see someone in a wheelchair, we assume they cannot walk.
p343
aVIt may be that they can walk three, four, five steps.
p344
aVThat, to them, means they can walk.
p345
aVIn a year's time, it could be two extra steps.
p346
aVIn another year's time, three extra steps.
p347
aa(lp348
VThose are hugely important aspects to think about.
p349
aVSo when we do listen to each other,
p350
aVit's unbelievably important for us
p351
aVto really test our listening skills,
p352
aVto really use our bodies as a resonating chamber,
p353
aVto stop the judgment.
p354
aVFor me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music,
p355
aVit's very easy for me to say,
p356
aV"Oh yes, I like that piece. No, I don't like that piece," and so on.
p357
aVAnd I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
p358
aVIt may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself
p359
aVand that particular piece of music,
p360
aVbut that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
p361
aVAnd you know, one of the great things about being a musician
p362
aVis that it is so unbelievably fluid.
p363
aVSo there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.
p364
aa(lp365
VIf I asked you to clap \u2014 maybe I can do this.
p366
aVIf I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."
p367
aVI'm assuming we've all experienced thunder.
p368
aVNow, I don't mean just the sound;
p369
aVI mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.
p370
aVAnd please try to create that through your clapping.
p371
aVTry, just \u2014 please try.
p372
aa(lp373
V(Loud clapping sounds)
p374
aa(lp375
V(Clapping ends)
p376
aa(lp377
VSnow.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
VSnow.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Soft clapping sounds)
p384
aa(lp385
VHave you ever heard snow?
p386
aa(lp387
VAudience: No.
p388
aa(lp389
VEvelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
VTry again. Try again: snow.
p394
aa(lp395
V(No sound)
p396
aa(lp397
VSee, you're awake.
p398
aa(lp399
VRain.
p400
aa(lp401
V(Light clapping sounds)
p402
aa(lp403
VEG: (Laughs)
p404
aa(lp405
VNot bad. Not bad.
p406
aVThe interesting thing here, though, is that I asked a group of kids
p407
aVnot so long ago
p408
aVexactly the same question.
p409
aVNow \u2014 great imagination, thank you very much.
p410
aVHowever, not one of you got out of your seats to think,
p411
aV"Right! How can I clap?
p412
aVOK, maybe:
p413
aa(lp414
V(Clapping sounds)
p415
aa(lp416
VMaybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds.
p417
aVMaybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."
p418
aVNot a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way
p419
aVother than sitting in your seats there and using two hands.
p420
aVIn the same way, when we listen to music,
p421
aVwe assume that it's all being fed through here.
p422
aVThis is how we experience music.
p423
aVOf course, it's not.
p424
aa(lp425
VWe experience thunder, thunder, thunder.
p426
aVThink, think, think.
p427
aVListen, listen, listen.
p428
aVNow, what can we do with thunder?
p429
aVI remember my teacher, when I first started, my very first lesson,
p430
aVI was all prepared with sticks, ready to go.
p431
aVAnd instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,
p432
aVarms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape,
p433
aVkeep this amount of space here, etc.
p434
aVPlease keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." \u2014
p435
aVwhere I was just probably going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen,
p436
aVand I would not be able to strike the drum
p437
aVbecause I was thinking of so many other things,
p438
aVhe said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days,
p439
aVand I'll see you next week."
p440
aa(lp441
VSo \u2014 heavens! What was I to do?
p442
aVI no longer required the sticks.
p443
aVI wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
p444
aVI had to basically look at this particular drum,
p445
aVsee how it was made,
p446
aVwhat these little lugs did, what the snares did.
p447
aVTurned it upside down, experimented with the shell.
p448
aa(lp449
V(Drum sounds)
p450
aa(lp451
VExperimented with the head.
p452
aa(lp453
V(Drum sounds)
p454
aa(lp455
VExperimented with my body.
p456
aa(lp457
V(Drum sounds)
p458
aa(lp459
VExperimented with jewelry.
p460
aVExperimented with all sorts of things.
p461
aa(lp462
V(Drum sounds)
p463
aa(lp464
V(Drum sounds end)
p465
aa(lp466
VAnd of course, I returned with all sorts of bruises.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Laughter)
p469
aa(lp470
VBut nevertheless, it was such an unbelievable experience,
p471
aVbecause where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?
p472
aVWhere on earth are you going to experience that in a study book?
p473
aVSo we never, ever dealt with actual study books.
p474
aVSo for example, one of the things that we learn
p475
aVwhen we are dealing with being a percussion player
p476
aVas opposed to a musician,
p477
aVis basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls.
p478
aa(lp479
V(Drum sounds)

VSo why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music?
p496
aVAnd that's exactly what he did.
p497
aVAnd interestingly, the older I became, and when I became a full-time student
p498
aVat a so-called "music institution," all of that went out of the window.
p499
aVWe had to study from study books.
p500
aVAnd constantly, the question, "Well, why? Why? What is this relating to?
p501
aVI need to play a piece of music."
p502
aV"Well, this will help your control."
p503
aV"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?
p504
aVI need to relate it to a piece of music.
p505
aVYou know, I need to say something.
p506
aa(lp507
VWhy am I practicing paradiddles?
p508
aa(lp509
V(Drum sounds)
p510
aa(lp511
VIs it just literally for control, for hand-stick control?
p512
aVWhy am I doing that?
p513
aVI need to have the reason,
p514
aVand the reason has to be by saying something through the music."
p515
aVAnd by saying something through music, which basically is sound,
p516
aVwe then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people.
p517
aVBut I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage.
p518
aVThat's up to you, when you walk through a hall,
p519
aVbecause that then determines what and how we listen to certain things.
p520
aVI may feel sorrowful, or happy, or exhilarated, or angry
p521
aVwhen I play certain pieces of music,
p522
aVbut I'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing.
p523
aVSo please, the next time you go to a concert,
p524
aVjust allow your body to open up,
p525
aVallow your body to be this resonating chamber.
p526
aVBe aware that you're not going to experience the same thing
p527
aVas the performer is.
p528
aa(lp529
VThe performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound,
p530
aVbecause they're hearing the contact of the stick \u2014
p531
aa(lp532
V(Drum sound)
p533
aa(lp534
Von the drum, or the mallet on the bit of wood,
p535
aVor the bow on the string, etc.,
p536
aVor the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.
p537
aVThey're experiencing that rawness there.
p538
aVBut yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure,
p539
aVwhich is before the sound is actually happening.
p540
aVPlease take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike,
p541
aVor breath, is being pulled.
p542
aVJust experience the whole journey of that sound
p543
aVin the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey
p544
aVof this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.
p545
aVBut I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses.
p546
aVBut thank you very much for having me!
