VI'm assuming everyone here has watched
p4
aVa TED Talk online at one time or another, right?
p5
aVSo what I'm going to do is play this.
p6
aVThis is the song from the TED Talks online.
p7
aV(Music)
p8
aVAnd I'm going to slow it down
p9
aVbecause things sound cooler when they're slower.
p10
aV(Music)
p11
aVKen Robinson: Good morning. How are you?
p12
aVMark Applebaum: I'm going to \u2014 Kate Stone: \u2014 mix some music.
p13
aVMA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.
p14
aVTod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.
p15
aVKS: I have a crossfader.
p16
aVJulian Treasure: I call this the mixer.
p17
aVKS: Two D.J. decks.
p18
aVChris Anderson: You turn up the  dials, the wheel starts to turn.
p19
aVDan Ellsey: I have always loved music.
p20
aVMichael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody  or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?
p21
aVDaniel Wolpert: Feeling everything  that's going on inside my body.
p22
aVAdam Ockelford: In your brain is  this amazing musical computer.
p23
aVMTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create  works. It's a language that's still evolving.
p24
aVAnd the 21st century.
p25
aVKR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.
p26
aVYou will know what this person  is doing: moving to the music.
p27
aVMark Ronson: This is my favorite part.
p28
aVMA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.
p29
aVTM: We all love music a great deal.
p30
aVMTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.
p31
aVKirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It  is new music created from old music.
p32
aVRyan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.
p33
aVKathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.
p34
aVMTT: What happens when the music stops?
p35
aVKS: Yay!
p36
aV(Applause)
p37
aVMR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.
p38
aVWhen I was first asked to speak at TED,
p39
aVI wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,
p40
aVso yeah, I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks,
p41
aVwhich is pretty much absolutely
p42
aVthe worst thing that you can do
p43
aVbecause you start to go into panic mode, thinking,
p44
aVI haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet.
p45
aVNeither have I provided electricity
p46
aVto my village through sheer ingenuity.
p47
aVIn fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life
p48
aVDJing in night clubs
p49
aVand producing pop records.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut I still kept watching the videos,
p52
aVbecause I'm a masochist,
p53
aVand eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas
p54
aVand Tod Machover, and seeing
p55
aVtheir visceral passion talking about music,
p56
aVit definitely stirred something in me,
p57
aVand I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly
p58
aVabout the power of music.
p59
aVAnd I started to write down on these little note cards
p60
aVevery time I heard something
p61
aVthat struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,
p62
aVor something that I thought I could use,
p63
aVand pretty soon, my studio looked like this,
p64
aVkind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe other good thing about watching TED Talks,
p67
aVwhen you see a really good one,
p68
aVyou kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker
p69
aVwas your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.
p70
aVThey seem like a nice person.
p71
aVYou'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.
p72
aVYou'd certainly learn a lot.
p73
aVAnd every now and then they'd chide you,
p74
aVwhen they got frustrated that you couldn't really
p75
aVkeep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time.
p76
aVBut then they'd remember that you're but a mere human
p77
aVof ordinary, mortal intelligence
p78
aVthat didn't finish university,
p79
aVand they'd kind of forgive you,
p80
aVand pet you like the dog.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VMan, yeah, back to the real world,
p84
aVprobably Sir Ken Robinson and I
p85
aVare not going to end up being best of friends.
p86
aVHe lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy,
p87
aVbut through the tools available to me \u2014 technology
p88
aVand the innate way that I approach making music \u2014
p89
aVI can sort of bully our existences
p90
aVinto a shared event,
p91
aVwhich is sort of what you saw.
p92
aVI can hear something that I love in a piece of media
p93
aVand I can co-opt it
p94
aVand insert myself in that narrative,
p95
aVor alter it, even.
p96
aa(lp97
VIn a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do
p98
aVwith these things, but more importantly,
p99
aVthat's what the past 30 years of music has been.
p100
aVThat's the major thread.
p101
aVSee, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,
p102
aVand they changed everything overnight.
p103
aVAll of a sudden, artists could sample
p104
aVfrom anything and everything that came before them,
p105
aVfrom a snare drum from the Funky Meters,
p106
aVto a Ron Carter bassline,
p107
aVthe theme to "The Price Is Right."
p108
aVAlbums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising"
p109
aVand the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique"
p110
aVlooted from decades of recorded music
p111
aVto create these sonic, layered masterpieces
p112
aVthat were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.
p113
aVAnd they weren't sampling these records
p114
aVbecause they were too lazy to write their own music.
p115
aVThey weren't sampling these records to cash in on
p116
aVthe familiarity of the original stuff.
p117
aVTo be honest, it was all about sampling
p118
aVreally obscure things,
p119
aVexcept for a few obvious exceptions
p120
aVlike Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo"
p121
aVthat we know about.
p122
aVBut the thing is,
p123
aVthey were sampling those records
p124
aVbecause they heard something in that music
p125
aVthat spoke to them
p126
aVthat they instantly wanted to inject themselves
p127
aVinto the narrative of that music.
p128
aVThey heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,
p129
aVand all of a sudden they found themselves
p130
aVin possession of the technology to do so,
p131
aVnot much unlike the way the Delta blues
p132
aVstruck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton,
p133
aVand they felt the need to co-opt that music
p134
aVfor the tools of their day.
p135
aVYou know, in music we take something that we love
p136
aVand we build on it.
p137
aa(lp138
VI'd like to play a song for you.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick)
p141
aa(lp142
VThat's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled
p143
aVsong of all time.
p144
aVIt's been sampled 547 times.
p145
aVIt was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,
p146
aVSlick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,
p147
aVand the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.
p148
aVI do hope that comes back soon.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnyway, this predated the sampling era.
p151
aVThere were no samples in this record,
p152
aValthough I did look up on the Internet last night,
p153
aVI mean several months ago,
p154
aVthat "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old
p155
aVCockney expression from the late 1800s in England,
p156
aVso maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore
p157
aVfrom "Downton Abbey" coming soon,
p158
aVor that's for another day.
p159
aa(lp160
VDoug E. Fresh was the human beat box.
p161
aVSlick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,
p162
aVand because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,
p163
aVsuper-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites
p164
aVand samples for future pop records.
p165
aa(lp166
VThat was 1984.
p167
aVThis is me in 1984, in case you were wondering
p168
aVhow I was doing, thank you for asking.
p169
aVIt's Throwback Thursday already.
p170
aVI was involved in a heavy love affair
p171
aVwith the music of Duran Duran,
p172
aVas you can probably tell from my outfit.
p173
aVI was in the middle.
p174
aVAnd the simplest way that I knew
p175
aVhow to co-opt myself into that experience
p176
aVof wanting to be in that song somehow
p177
aVwas to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds
p178
aVand play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.
p179
aVSo that's what we did, and long story short,
p180
aVwe were booed off the stage,
p181
aVand if you ever have a chance to live your life
p182
aVescaping hearing the sound of an auditorium
p183
aVfull of second- and third-graders booing,
p184
aVI would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.
p185
aVBut it didn't really matter,
p186
aVbecause what I wanted somehow
p187
aVwas to just be in the history of that song for a minute.
p188
aVI didn't care who liked it.
p189
aVI just loved it, and I thought I could put myself in there.
p190
aa(lp191
VOver the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di"
p192
aVcontinues to be sampled by countless records,
p193
aVending up on massive hits like "Here Comes the Hotstepper"
p194
aVand "I Wanna Sex You Up."
p195
aVSnoop Doggy Dogg covers this song
p196
aVon his debut album "Doggystyle" and calls it "Lodi Dodi."
p197
aVCopyright lawyers are having a field day at this point.
p198
aVAnd then you fast forward to 1997,
p199
aVand the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,
p200
aVreinterprets "La Di Da Di"
p201
aVon his number one hit called "Hypnotize,"
p202
aVwhich I will play a little bit of
p203
aVand I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick
p204
aVto show you where they got it from.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Music: "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.)
p207
aa(lp208
VSo Biggie was killed
p209
aVweeks before that song made it to number one,
p210
aVin one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,
p211
aVbut he would have been 13 years old
p212
aVand very much alive when "La Di Da Di" first came out,
p213
aVand as a young boy
p214
aVgrowing up in Brooklyn,
p215
aVit's hard not to think that that song probably held
p216
aVsome fond memories for him.
p217
aVBut the way he interpreted it, as you hear,
p218
aVis completely his own.
p219
aVHe flips it, makes it,
p220
aVthere's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.
p221
aVIt's thoroughly modern Biggie.
p222
aVI had to make that joke in this room,
p223
aVbecause you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.
p224
aVAnd so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VElsewhere in the pop and rap world,
p227
aVwe're going a little bit sample-crazy.
p228
aVWe're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing,
p229
aVand all of a sudden everyone's taking
p230
aVthese massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance,"
p231
aVand all these disco records, and just rapping on them.
p232
aVThese records don't really age that well.
p233
aVYou don't hear them now, because they borrowed
p234
aVfrom an era that was too steeped
p235
aVin its own connotation.
p236
aVYou can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.
p237
aVIt leaves the listener feeling sickly.
p238
aa(lp239
VYou have to take an element of those things
p240
aVand then bring something fresh and new to it,
p241
aVwhich was something that I learned
p242
aVwhen I was working with the late,
p243
aVamazing Amy Winehouse
p244
aVon her album "Back to Black."
p245
aVA lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album
p246
aVthat myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,
p247
aVachieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,
p248
aVbut without the very, very 21st-century personality
p249
aVand firebrand that was Amy Winehouse
p250
aVand her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore
p251
aVand even a mention of Slick Rick,
p252
aVthe whole thing would have run the risk
p253
aVof being very pastiche, to be honest.
p254
aVImagine any other singer from that era over it
p255
aVsinging the same old lyrics.
p256
aVIt runs a risk of being completely bland.
p257
aVI mean, there was no doubt that Amy
p258
aVand I and Salaam all had this love
p259
aVfor this gospel, soul and blues and jazz
p260
aVthat was evident listening to the musical arrangements.
p261
aVShe brought the ingredients that made it urgent
p262
aVand of the time.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo if we come all the way up to the present day now,
p265
aVthe cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,
p266
aVshe reinterprets "La Di Da Di"
p267
aVcompletely for her generation,
p268
aVand we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part
p269
aVand then see how she sort of flipped it.
p270
aV(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick & Doug E. Fresh)
p271
aV(Music: "We Can't Stop" by Miley Cyrus)
p272
aVSo Miley Cyrus,
p273
aVwho wasn't even born yet when "La Di Da Di" was made,
p274
aVand neither were any of the co-writers on the song,
p275
aVhas found this song that somehow
p276
aVetched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music,
p277
aVand now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,
p278
aVhas kind of translated to a whole new generation
p279
aVwho will probably co-opt it as their own.
p280
aa(lp281
VSince the dawn of the sampling era,
p282
aVthere's been endless debate
p283
aVabout the validity of music that contains samples.
p284
aVYou know, the Grammy committee says that
p285
aVif your song contains some kind of pre-written
p286
aVor pre-existing music,
p287
aVyou're ineligible for song of the year.
p288
aVRockists, who are racist
p289
aVbut only about rock music,
p290
aVconstantly use the argument to \u2014
p291
aVThat's a real word. That is a real word.
p292
aVThey constantly use the argument to devalue rap
p293
aVand modern pop,
p294
aVand these arguments completely miss the point,
p295
aVbecause the dam has burst.
p296
aVWe live in the post-sampling era.
p297
aVWe take the things that we love
p298
aVand we build on them.
p299
aVThat's just how it goes.
p300
aVAnd when we really add something significant and original
p301
aVand we merge our musical journey with this,
p302
aVthen we have a chance to be
p303
aVa part of the evolution of that music that we love
p304
aVand be linked with it once it becomes something new again.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo I would like to do one more piece
p307
aVthat I put together for you tonight,
p308
aVand it takes place with two
p309
aVpretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.
p310
aVOne of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,
p311
aVwho happens to be a blind,
p312
aVautistic genius at the piano,
p313
aVand Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier
p314
aVfrom the South Sudan,
p315
aVwho is a spoken word poet and rapper.
p316
aVAnd once again I found a way to annoyingly
p317
aVme-me-me myself into the musical history
p318
aVof these songs,
p319
aVbut I can't help it,
p320
aVbecause they're these things that I love,
p321
aVand I want to mess around with them.
p322
aVSo I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.
p323
aa(lp324
VLet's hear that TED sound again, right?
p325
aa(lp326

p327
