VI'm used to thinking of the TED audience
p4
aVas a wonderful collection of some of the most effective,
p5
aVintelligent, intellectual, savvy,
p6
aVworldly and innovative people in the world.
p7
aVAnd I think that's true.
p8
aVHowever, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you
p9
aVare actually tying your shoes incorrectly.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VNow I know that seems ludicrous.
p14
aVI know that seems ludicrous.
p15
aVAnd believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago.
p16
aVAnd what happened to me
p17
aVwas I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes.
p18
aVBut those shoes came with round nylon laces,
p19
aVand I couldn't keep them tied.
p20
aVSo I went back to the store and said to the owner,
p21
aV"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."
p22
aVHe took a look and said, "Oh, you're tying them wrong."
p23
aVNow up until that moment,
p24
aVI would have thought that, by age 50,
p25
aVone of the life skills that I had really nailed
p26
aVwas tying my shoes.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VBut not so \u2014 let me demonstrate.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis is the way
p33
aVthat most of us were taught to tie our shoes.
p34
aVNow as it turns out \u2014 thank you.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Applause)
p37
aa(lp38
VWait, there's more.
p39
aVAs it turns out \u2014
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
Vthere's a strong form and a weak form of this knot,
p44
aVand we were taught the weak form.
p45
aVAnd here's how to tell.
p46
aVIf you pull the strands at the base of the knot,
p47
aVyou will see that the bow will orient itself
p48
aVdown the long axis of the shoe.
p49
aVThat's the weak form of the knot.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut not to worry.
p52
aVIf we start over
p53
aVand simply go the other direction around the bow,
p54
aVwe get this, the strong form of the knot.
p55
aVAnd if you pull the cords under the knot,
p56
aVyou will see that the bow orients itself
p57
aValong the transverse axis of the shoe.
p58
aVThis is a stronger knot.
p59
aVIt will come untied less often.
p60
aVIt will let you down less, and not only that, it looks better.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe're going to do this one more time.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VStart as usual \u2014
p67
aa(lp68
V(Applause)
p69
aa(lp70
Vgo the other way around the loop.
p71
aVThis is a little hard for children,
p72
aVbut I think you can handle it.
p73
aVPull the knot.
p74
aVThere it is: the strong form of the shoe knot.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, in keeping with today's theme,
p77
aVI'd like to point out \u2014 something you already know \u2014
p78
aVthat sometimes a small advantage someplace in life
p79
aVcan yield tremendous results someplace else.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VLive long and prosper.
