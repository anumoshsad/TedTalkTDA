VI would like to talk to you about why many ehealth projects fail.
p4
aVAnd I really think that the most important thing of it
p5
aVis that we stopped listening to patients.
p6
aVAnd one thing we did at Radboud University
p7
aVis we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.
p8
aVNot in a very scientific way \u2014
p9
aVshe puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea
p10
aVand asks patients, family, relatives,
p11
aV"What's up?
p12
aVHow could we help you?"
p13
aVAnd we think, we like to think,
p14
aVthat this is one of the major problems
p15
aVwhy all \u2014 maybe not all \u2014
p16
aVbut most of the ehealth projects fail,
p17
aVsince we stopped listening.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is my weight scale.
p20
aVIt's a very simple thing. It's got one knob, on/off.
p21
aVAnd every morning I hop on it.
p22
aVAnd yes, I've got a challenge,
p23
aVas you might see.
p24
aVAnd I put my challenge on 95 kg.
p25
aVBut the thing is that it's made this simple
p26
aVthat whenever I hop on,
p27
aVit sends my data to Google Health as well.
p28
aVAnd it's collected by my general practitioner as well,
p29
aVso he can see what's my problem in weight,
p30
aVnot on the very moment that I need cardiologic support
p31
aVor something like it,
p32
aVbut also looking backward.
p33
aVBut there's another thing.
p34
aVAs some of you might know,
p35
aVI've got more than 4000 followers on Twitter.
p36
aVSo every morning, I hop on my weight scale
p37
aVand before I'm in my car,
p38
aVpeople start talking to me,
p39
aV"I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VBut that's the nicest thing that could happen,
p44
aVsince this is peer pressure.
p45
aVPeer pressure used to help patients \u2014
p46
aVsince this could be used for obesity,
p47
aVit could be used to stop patients from smoking.
p48
aVBut on the other hand,
p49
aVit also could be used to get people out of their chairs
p50
aVand try to work together in some kind of gaming activity
p51
aVto get more control of their health.
p52
aa(lp53
VAs of next week, it will soon be available,
p54
aVthere will be this little blood-pressure meter
p55
aVconnected to an iPhone or something or other.
p56
aVAnd people will be able, from their homes,
p57
aVto take their blood pressure,
p58
aVsend it to their doctor
p59
aVand eventually share it with others, for instance,
p60
aVfor over a 100 dollars.
p61
aVAnd this is the point where patients get into position
p62
aVand can collect, not only their own control again,
p63
aVbe captain of their own ship,
p64
aVbut also can help us in health care
p65
aVdue to the challenges that we face,
p66
aVlike health-care cost explosion,
p67
aVdoubled demand and things like that,
p68
aVmake techniques that are easy to use
p69
aVand start with this to embrace patients in the team.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd you can do this with techniques like this,
p72
aVbut also by crowdsourcing.
p73
aVAnd one of the things we did,
p74
aVthat I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Music)
p77
aa(lp78
V(Heart-beat)
p79
aa(lp80
VWe've all got navigation controls in our car.
p81
aVWe maybe even have it in our cellphone.
p82
aVWe perfectly know where all the ATMs are,
p83
aVjust about the city of Maastricht.
p84
aVThe other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.
p85
aVAnd sure, we could find fast food chains.
p86
aVBut where would be the nearest AED to help this patient?
p87
aVWe asked around, and nobody knew.
p88
aVNobody knew where the nearest lifesaving AED
p89
aVwas to be obtained right now.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo what we did, we crowdsourced the Netherlands.
p92
aVWe set up a website, and asked the crowd,
p93
aV"If you see an AED, please submit it,
p94
aVtell us where it is, tell us when it's open,"
p95
aVsince sometimes in office hours it's closed, of course.
p96
aVAnd over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands
p97
aValready have been submitted.
p98
aVThe next step we took was to find the applications for it.
p99
aVAnd we built an iPad application.
p100
aVWe made an application for Layar: Augmented Reality,
p101
aVto find these AEDs.
p102
aVAnd whenever you are in a city like Maastricht,
p103
aVand somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone,
p104
aVand within the next weeks also your Microsoft cellphone,
p105
aVto find the nearest AED,
p106
aVwhich can save lives.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd as of today,
p109
aVwe would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,
p110
aVwhich is what the product is called,
p111
aVbut also AED4US.
p112
aVAnd we would like to start this on a worldwide level.
p113
aVAnd ask all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,
p114
aVcolleague universities, to help us
p115
aVto find and work and act like a hub
p116
aVto crowdsource all these AEDs all around the world,
p117
aVthat whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,
p118
aVmight it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,
p119
aVyou can find this.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe other thing we would like to ask
p122
aVis of companies also all over the world
p123
aVthat will be able to help us validate these AEDs.
p124
aVThese might be courier services
p125
aVor cable guys, for instance,
p126
aVjust to see whether the AED that is submitted
p127
aVis still in place.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo please help us on this one
p130
aVand try to make not only health a little bit better,
p131
aVbut take control of it.
p132
aa(lp133
VThank you.
