VHawa Abdi: Many people \u2014 20 years for Somalia \u2014
p4
aV[were] fighting.
p5
aVSo there was no job, no food.
p6
aVChildren, most of them,
p7
aVbecame very malnourished, like this.
p8
aVDeqo Mohamed: So as you know,
p9
aValways in a civil war,
p10
aVthe ones affected most [are] the women and children.
p11
aVSo our patients are women and children.
p12
aVAnd they are in our backyard.
p13
aVIt's our home. We welcome them.
p14
aVThat's the camp that we have in now
p15
aV90,000 people,
p16
aVwhere 75 percent of them are women and children.
p17
aVPat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.
p18
aVHA: We are doing C-sections and different operations
p19
aVbecause people need some help.
p20
aVThere is no government to protect them.
p21
aVDM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,
p22
aVmaybe more or less.
p23
aVBut sometimes we are only five doctors
p24
aVand 16 nurses,
p25
aVand we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.
p26
aVBut we take the severe ones,
p27
aVand we reschedule the other ones the next day.
p28
aVIt is very tough.
p29
aVAnd as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;
p30
aVit's the women who come into the hospitals;
p31
aVit's the women [are] building the houses.
p32
aVThat's their house.
p33
aVAnd we have a school. This is our bright \u2014
p34
aVwe opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school
p35
aVwhere we have 850 children,
p36
aVand the majority are women and girls.
p37
aV(Applause)
p38
aVPM: And the doctors have some very big rules
p39
aVabout who can get treated at the clinic.
p40
aVWould you explain the rules for admission?
p41
aVHA: The people who are coming to us,
p42
aVwe are welcoming.
p43
aVWe are sharing with them
p44
aVwhatever we have.
p45
aVBut there are only two rules.
p46
aVFirst rule:
p47
aVthere is no clan distinguished and political division
p48
aVin Somali society.
p49
aV[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.
p50
aVThe second:
p51
aVno man can beat his wife.
p52
aVIf he beat,
p53
aVwe will put [him] in jail,
p54
aVand we will call the eldest people.
p55
aVUntil they identify this case,
p56
aVwe'll never release him.
p57
aVThat's our two rules.
p58
aV(Applause)
p59
aVThe other thing that I have realized,
p60
aVthat the woman is the most strong person
p61
aVall over the world.
p62
aVBecause the last 20 years,
p63
aVthe Somali woman has stood up.
p64
aVThey were the leaders,
p65
aVand we are the leaders
p66
aVof our community
p67
aVand the hope of our future generations.
p68
aVWe are not just the helpless
p69
aVand the victims of the civil war.
p70
aVWe can reconcile.
p71
aVWe can do everything.
p72
aV(Applause)
p73
aVDM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,
p74
aVand the men are only killing in Somalia.
p75
aVSo we came up with these two rules.
p76
aVIn a camp with 90,000 people,
p77
aVyou have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.
p78
aVSo there is no clan division,
p79
aVand no man can beat his wife.
p80
aVAnd we have a little storage room
p81
aVwhere we converted a jail.
p82
aVSo if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVSo empowering the women and giving the opportunity \u2014
p85
aVwe are there for them. They are not alone for this.
p86
aVPM: You're running a medical clinic.
p87
aVIt brought much, much needed medical care
p88
aVto people who wouldn't get it.
p89
aVYou're also running a civil society.
p90
aVYou've created your own rules,
p91
aVin which women and children
p92
aVare getting a different sense of security.
p93
aVTalk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,
p94
aVand your decision, Dr. Mohamed,
p95
aVto work together \u2014
p96
aVfor you to become a doctor
p97
aVand to work with your mother in these circumstances.
p98
aVHA: My age \u2014
p99
aVbecause I was born in 1947 \u2014
p100
aVwe were having, at that time,
p101
aVgovernment, law and order.
p102
aVBut one day, I went to the hospital \u2014
p103
aVmy mother was sick \u2014
p104
aVand I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,
p105
aVhow they [are] committed
p106
aVto help the sick people.
p107
aVI admired them,
p108
aVand I decided to become a doctor.
p109
aVMy mother died, unfortunately,
p110
aVwhen I was 12 years [old].
p111
aVThen my father allowed me
p112
aVto proceed [with] my hope.
p113
aVMy mother died
p114
aVin [a] gynecology complication,
p115
aVso I decided to become
p116
aVa gynecology specialist.
p117
aVThat's why I became a doctor.
p118
aVSo Dr. Deqo has to explain.
p119
aVDM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child
p120
aVto become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.
p121
aVMaybe I should become an historian,
p122
aVor maybe a reporter.
p123
aVI loved it, but it didn't work.
p124
aVWhen the war broke out \u2014 civil war \u2014
p125
aVI saw how my mother was helping
p126
aVand how she really needed the help,
p127
aVand how the care is essential to the woman
p128
aVto be a woman doctor in Somalia
p129
aVand help the women and children.
p130
aVAnd I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVSo I went to Russia, and my mother also,
p133
aV[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.
p134
aVSo some of our character,
p135
aVmaybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.
p136
aVSo that's how I decided [to do] the same.
p137
aVMy sister was different.
p138
aVShe's here. She's also a doctor.
p139
aVShe graduated in Russia also.
p140
aV(Applause)
p141
aVAnd to go back and to work with our mother
p142
aVis just what we saw in the civil war \u2014
p143
aVwhen I was 16, and my sister was 11,
p144
aVwhen the civil war broke out.
p145
aVSo it was the need and the people we saw
p146
aVin the early '90s \u2014
p147
aVthat's what made us go back
p148
aVand work for them.
p149
aVPM: So what is the biggest challenge
p150
aVworking, mother and daughter,
p151
aVin such dangerous
p152
aVand sometimes scary situations?
p153
aVHA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,
p154
aVvery dangerous.
p155
aVAnd when I saw the people who needed me,
p156
aVI was staying with them to help,
p157
aVbecause I [could] do something for them.
p158
aVMost people fled abroad.
p159
aVBut I remained with those people,
p160
aVand I was trying to do something \u2014
p161
aV[any] little thing I [could] do.
p162
aVI succeeded in my place.
p163
aVNow my place is 90,000 people
p164
aVwho are respecting each other,
p165
aVwho are not fighting.
p166
aVBut we try to stand on our feet,
p167
aVto do something, little things, we can for our people.
p168
aVAnd I'm thankful for my daughters.
p169
aVWhen they come to me,
p170
aVthey help me to treat the people,
p171
aVto help.
p172
aVThey do everything for them.
p173
aVThey have done what I desire to do for them.
p174
aVPM: What's the best part
p175
aVof working with your mother,
p176
aVand the most challenging part for you?
p177
aVDM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.
p178
aVShe always expects us to do more.
p179
aVAnd really when you think [you] cannot do it,
p180
aVshe will push you, and I can do it.
p181
aVThat's the best part.
p182
aVShe shows us, trains us how to do
p183
aVand how to be better [people]
p184
aVand how to do long hours in surgery \u2014
p185
aV300 patients per day,
p186
aV10, 20 surgeries,
p187
aVand still you have to manage the camp \u2014
p188
aVthat's how she trains us.
p189
aVIt is not like beautiful offices here,
p190
aV20 patients, you're tired.
p191
aVYou see 300 patients, 20 surgeries
p192
aVand 90,000 people to manage.
p193
