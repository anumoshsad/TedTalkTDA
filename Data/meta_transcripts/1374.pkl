VLet me begin with four words
p4
aVthat will provide the context for this week,
p5
aVfour words that will come to define
p6
aVthis century.
p7
aVHere they are:
p8
aVThe Earth is full.
p9
aVIt's full of us, it's full of our stuff,
p10
aVfull of our waste, full of our demands.
p11
aVYes, we are a brilliant and creative species,
p12
aVbut we've created a little too much stuff \u2014
p13
aVso much that our economy is now bigger
p14
aVthan its host, our planet.
p15
aa(lp16
VThis is not a philosophical statement,
p17
aVthis is just science
p18
aVbased in physics,
p19
aVchemistry and biology.
p20
aVThere are many science-based analyses of this,
p21
aVbut they all draw the same conclusion \u2014
p22
aVthat we're living beyond our means.
p23
aVThe eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example,
p24
aVcalculate that we need about 1.5 Earths
p25
aVto sustain this economy.
p26
aVIn other words,
p27
aVto keep operating at our current level,
p28
aVwe need 50 percent more Earth than we've got.
p29
aVIn financial terms,
p30
aVthis would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn,
p31
aVgoing further into debt every year.
p32
aVBut of course, you can't borrow natural resources,
p33
aVso we're burning through our capital,
p34
aVor stealing from the future.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo when I say full, I mean really full \u2014
p37
aVwell past any margin for error,
p38
aVwell past any dispute
p39
aVabout methodology.
p40
aVWhat this means is our economy is unsustainable.
p41
aVI'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant
p42
aVor that it's bad for polar bears or forests,
p43
aVthough it certainly is.
p44
aVWhat I'm saying
p45
aVis our approach is simply unsustainable.
p46
aVIn other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics,
p47
aVwhen things aren't sustainable, they stop.
p48
aVBut that's not possible, you might think.
p49
aVWe can't stop economic growth.
p50
aVBecause that's what will stop: economic growth.
p51
aVIt will stop because of the end of trade resources.
p52
aVIt will stop because of the growing demand of us
p53
aVon all the resources, all the capacity,
p54
aVall the systems of the Earth,
p55
aVwhich is now having economic damage.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhen we think about economic growth stopping,
p58
aVwe go, "That's not possible,"
p59
aVbecause economic growth is so essential to our society
p60
aVthat is is rarely questioned.
p61
aVAlthough growth has certainly delivered many benefits,
p62
aVit is an idea so essential
p63
aVthat we tend not to understand
p64
aVthe possibility of it not being around.
p65
aVEven though it has delivered many benefits,
p66
aVit is based on a crazy idea \u2014
p67
aVthe crazy idea being
p68
aVthat we can have infinite growth
p69
aVon a finite planet.
p70
aVAnd I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.
p71
aVThat the crazy idea is just that,
p72
aVit is crazy,
p73
aVand with the Earth full, it's game over.
p74
aa(lp75
VCome on, you're thinking.
p76
aVThat's not possible.
p77
aVTechnology is amazing. People are innovative.
p78
aVThere are so many ways we can improve the way we do things.
p79
aVWe can surely sort this out.
p80
aVThat's all true.
p81
aVWell, it's mostly true.
p82
aVWe are certainly amazing,
p83
aVand we regularly solve complex problems
p84
aVwith amazing creativity.
p85
aVSo if our problem
p86
aVwas to get the human economy down
p87
aVfrom 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth's capacity,
p88
aVwe could do that.
p89
aVThe problem is we're just warming up
p90
aVthis growth engine.
p91
aVWe plan to take this highly-stressed economy
p92
aVand make it twice as big
p93
aVand then make it four times as big \u2014
p94
aVnot in some distant future,
p95
aVbut in less than 40 years,
p96
aVin the life time of most of you.
p97
aVChina plans to be there in just 20 years.
p98
aVThe only problem with this plan
p99
aVis that it's not possible.
p100
aa(lp101
VIn response, some people argue,
p102
aVbut we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.
p103
aVWe need it to develop technology.
p104
aVWe need it to keep social stability.
p105
aVI find this argument fascinating,
p106
aVas though we can kind of bend the rules of physics
p107
aVto suit our needs.
p108
aVIt's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.
p109
aVMother nature doesn't negotiate;
p110
aVshe just sets rules and describes consequences.
p111
aVAnd these are not esoteric limits.
p112
aVThis is about food and water, soil and climate,
p113
aVthe basic practical and economic foundations
p114
aVof our lives.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo the idea that we can smoothly transition
p117
aVto a highly-efficient,
p118
aVsolar-powered, knowledge-based economy
p119
aVtransformed by science and technology
p120
aVso that nine billion people
p121
aVcan live in 2050
p122
aVa life of abundance and digital downloads
p123
aVis a delusion.
p124
aVIt's not that it's not possible to feed, clothe and house us all
p125
aVand have us live decent lives.
p126
aVIt certainly is.
p127
aVBut the idea that we can gently grow there
p128
aVwith a few minor hiccups
p129
aVis just wrong,
p130
aVand it's dangerously wrong,
p131
aVbecause it means we're not getting ready
p132
aVfor what's really going to happen.
p133
aa(lp134
VSee what happens when you operate a system
p135
aVpast its limits
p136
aVand then keep on going
p137
aVat an ever-accelerating rate
p138
aVis that the system stops working and breaks down.
p139
aVAnd that's what will happen to us.
p140
aVMany of you will be thinking,
p141
aVbut surely we can still stop this.
p142
aVIf it's that bad, we'll react.
p143
aVLet's just think through that idea.
p144
aVNow we've had
p145
aV50 years of warnings.
p146
aVWe've had science proving
p147
aVthe urgency of change.
p148
aVWe've had economic analysis pointing out
p149
aVthat, not only can we afford it,
p150
aVit's cheaper to act early.
p151
aVAnd yet, the reality is
p152
aVwe've done pretty much nothing to change course.
p153
aVWe're not even slowing down.
p154
aVLast year on climate, for example,
p155
aVwe had the highest global emissions ever.
p156
aVThe story on food, on water, on soil, on climate
p157
aVis all much the same.
p158
aa(lp159
VI actually don't say this in despair.
p160
aVI've done my grieving about the loss.
p161
aVI accept where we are.
p162
aVIt is sad,
p163
aVbut it is what it is.
p164
aVBut it is also time
p165
aVthat we ended our denial
p166
aVand recognized
p167
aVthat we're not acting, we're not close to acting
p168
aVand we're not going to act
p169
aVuntil this crisis hits the economy.
p170
aVAnd that's why the end of growth
p171
aVis the central issue
p172
aVand the event that we need to get ready for.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo when does this transition begin?
p175
aVWhen does this breakdown begin?
p176
aVIn my view, it is well underway.
p177
aVI know most people don't see it that way.
p178
aVWe tend to look at the world,
p179
aVnot as the integrated system that it is,
p180
aVbut as a series of individual issues.
p181
aVWe see the Occupy protests,
p182
aVwe see spiraling debt crises,
p183
aVwe see growing inequality,
p184
aVwe see money's influence on politics,
p185
aVwe see resource constraint, food and oil prices.
p186
aVBut we see, mistakenly, each of these issues
p187
aVas individual problems to be solved.
p188
aVIn fact, it's the system
p189
aVin the painful process of breaking down \u2014
p190
aVour system, of debt-fueled economic growth,
p191
aVof ineffective democracy,
p192
aVof overloading planet Earth,
p193
aVis eating itself alive.
p194
aa(lp195
VI could give you countless studies
p196
aVand evidence to prove this,
p197
aVbut I won't because, if you want to see it,
p198
aVthat evidence is all around you.
p199
aVI want to talk to you about fear.
p200
aVI want to do so because, in my view,
p201
aVthe most important issue we face
p202
aVis how we respond
p203
aVto this question.
p204
aVThe crisis is now inevitable.
p205
aVThis issue is, how will we react?
p206
aVOf course, we can't know what will happen.
p207
aVThe future is inherently uncertain.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut let's just think through what the science is telling us
p210
aVis likely to happen.
p211
aVImagine our economy
p212
aVwhen the carbon bubble bursts,
p213
aVwhen the financial markets recognize
p214
aVthat, to have any hope
p215
aVof preventing the climate spiraling out of control,
p216
aVthe oil and coal industries are finished.
p217
aVImagine China, India and Pakistan going to war
p218
aVas climate impacts
p219
aVgenerate conflict over food and water.
p220
aVImagine the Middle East without oil income,
p221
aVbut with collapsing governments.
p222
aVImagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry
p223
aVand our highly-stressed agricultural system failing
p224
aVand supermarket shelves emptying.
p225
aVImagine 30 percent unemployment in America
p226
aVas the global economy is gripped
p227
aVby fear and uncertainty.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow imagine what that means for you,
p230
aVyour family, your friends,
p231
aVyour personal financial security.
p232
aVImagine what it means
p233
aVfor your personal security
p234
aVas a heavily armed civilian population
p235
aVgets angrier and angrier
p236
aVabout why this was allowed to happen.
p237
aVImagine what you'll tell your children
p238
aVwhen they ask you,
p239
aV"So, in 2012, Mom and Dad,
p240
aVwhat was it like
p241
aVwhen you'd had the hottest decade on record
p242
aVfor the third decade in a row,
p243
aVwhen every scientific body in the world was saying
p244
aVyou've got a major problem,
p245
aVwhen the oceans were acidifying,
p246
aVwhen oil and food prices were spiking,
p247
aVwhen they were rioting in the streets of London
p248
aVand occupying Wall Street?
p249
aVWhen the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad,
p250
aVwhat did you do, what were you thinking?"
p251
aa(lp252
VSo how do you feel
p253
aVwhen the lights go out
p254
aVon the global economy in your mind,
p255
aVwhen your assumptions about the future
p256
aVfade away
p257
aVand something very different emerges?
p258
aVJust take a moment
p259
aVand take a breath
p260
aVand think, what do you feel
p261
aVat this point?
p262
aVPerhaps denial.
p263
aVPerhaps anger.
p264
aVMaybe fear.
p265
aVOf course, we can't know what's going to happen
p266
aVand we have to live with uncertainty.
p267
aVBut when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint,
p268
aVwe should feel a bit of fear.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe are in danger, all of us,
p271
aVand we've evolved to respond to danger with fear
p272
aVto motivate a powerful response,
p273
aVto help us bravely face a threat.
p274
aVBut this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.
p275
aVYou can't see the danger at your door.
p276
aVBut if you look,
p277
aVyou can see it at the door of your civilization.
p278
aVThat's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on,
p279
aVbecause if we wait until the crisis takes hold,
p280
aVwe may panic and hide.
p281
aVIf we feel it now and think it through,
p282
aVwe will realize we have nothing to fear
p283
aVbut fear itself.
p284
aVYes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon \u2014
p285
aVcertainly in our lifetime \u2014
p286
aVbut we are more than capable
p287
aVof getting through everything that's coming.
p288
aa(lp289
VYou see, those people that have faith
p290
aVthat humans can solve any problem,
p291
aVthat technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good,
p292
aVare in fact right.
p293
aVThe only thing they're missing
p294
aVis that it takes a good crisis to get us going.
p295
aVWhen we feel fear and we fear loss
p296
aVwe are capable of quite extraordinary things.
p297
aVThink about war.
p298
aVAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days
p299
aVfor the government to ban the production of civilian cars
p300
aVand to redirect the auto industry,
p301
aVand from there to rationing of food and energy.
p302
aVThink about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat
p303
aVand how a change that seemed impossible just gets done.
p304
aVThink about how an individual responds
p305
aVto a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness
p306
aVand how lifestyle changes
p307
aVthat previously were just too difficult
p308
aVsuddenly become relatively easy.
p309
aa(lp310
VWe are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing,
p311
aVbut we do love a good crisis.
p312
aVAnd the good news, this one's a monster.
p313
aV(Laughter)
p314
aVSure, if we get it wrong,
p315
aVwe could face the end of this civilization,
p316
aVbut if we get it right,
p317
aVit could be the beginning of civilization instead.
p318
aVAnd how cool would it be
p319
aVto tell your grandchildren that you were part of that?
p320
aa(lp321
VThere's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way.
p322
aVScientists like James Hansen tell us
p323
aVwe may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy
p324
aVin just a few decades.
p325
aVI wanted to know what that would take,
p326
aVso I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway
p327
aVto find the answer.
p328
aVWe developed a plan called "The One Degree War Plan" \u2014
p329
aVso named because of the level of mobilization and focus required.
p330
aVTo my surprise,
p331
aVeliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years
p332
aVis actually pretty easy and pretty cheap,
p333
aVnot very cheap,
p334
aVbut certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.
p335
aVWe didn't calculate that precisely,
p336
aVbut we understand that's very expensive.
p337
aVYou can read the details,
p338
aVbut in summary, we can transform our economy.
p339
aVWe can do it with proven technology.
p340
aVWe can do it at an affordable cost.
p341
aVWe can do it with existing political structures.
p342
aVThe only thing we need to change
p343
aVis how we think and how we feel.
p344
aVAnd this is where you come in.
p345
aa(lp346
VWhen we think about the future I paint,
p347
aVof course we should feel a bit of fear.
p348
aVBut fear can be paralyzing or motivating.
p349
aVWe need to accept the fear and then we need to act.
p350
aVWe need to act
p351
aVlike the future depends on it.
p352
aVWe need to act like we only have one planet.
p353
aVWe can do this.
p354
aVI know the free market fundamentalists will tell you
p355
aVthat more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping
p356
aVis the best we can do.
p357
aVThey're wrong.
p358
aVWe can be more,
p359
aVwe can be much more.
p360
aVWe have achieved remarkable things
p361
aVsince working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago.
p362
aVWe've built a powerful foundation
p363
aVof science, knowledge and technology \u2014
p364
aVmore than enough to build a society
p365
aVwhere nine billion people
p366
aVcan lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.
p367
aVThe Earth can support that
p368
aVif we choose the right path.
p369
aa(lp370
VWe can choose this moment of crisis
p371
aVto ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution \u2014
p372
aVlike, what do we want to be when we grow up,
p373
aVwhen we move past this bumbling adolescence
p374
aVwhere we think there are no limits
p375
aVand suffer delusions of immortality?
p376
aVWell it's time to grow up,
p377
aVto be wiser, to be calmer,
p378
aVto be more considered.
p379
aVLike generations before us,
p380
aVwe'll be growing up in war \u2014
p381
aVnot a war between civilizations,
p382
aVbut a war for civilization,
p383
aVfor the extraordinary opportunity
p384
aVto build a society
p385
aVwhich is stronger and happier
p386
aVand plans on staying around
p387
aVinto middle age.
p388
aa(lp389
VWe can choose life over fear.
p390
aVWe can do what we need to do,
p391
aVbut it will take every entrepreneur,
p392
aVevery artist,
p393
aVevery scientist, every communicator,
p394
aVevery mother, every father, every child,
p395
aVevery one of us.
p396
aVThis could be our finest hour.
p397
aa(lp398
