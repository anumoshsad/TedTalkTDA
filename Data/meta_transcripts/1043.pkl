VThe first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.
p4
aVThe second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author
p5
aVand dear friend and co-teacher.
p6
aVKen and I have been working together
p7
aVfor almost 40 years.
p8
aVThat's Ken Sharpe over there.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Applause)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo there is among many people \u2014
p13
aVcertainly me and most of the people I talk to \u2014
p14
aVa kind of collective dissatisfaction
p15
aVwith the way things are working,
p16
aVwith the way our institutions run.
p17
aVOur kids' teachers seem to be failing them.
p18
aVOur doctors don't know who the hell we are,
p19
aVand they don't have enough time for us.
p20
aVWe certainly can't trust the bankers,
p21
aVand we certainly can't trust the brokers.
p22
aVThey almost brought the entire financial system down.
p23
aVAnd even as we do our own work,
p24
aVall too often,
p25
aVwe find ourselves having to choose
p26
aVbetween doing what we think is the right thing
p27
aVand doing the expected thing,
p28
aVor the required thing,
p29
aVor the profitable thing.
p30
aVSo everywhere we look,
p31
aVpretty much across the board,
p32
aVwe worry that the people we depend on
p33
aVdon't really have our interests at heart.
p34
aVOr if they do have our interests at heart,
p35
aVwe worry that they don't know us well enough
p36
aVto figure out what they need to do
p37
aVin order to allow us
p38
aVto secure those interests.
p39
aVThey don't understand us.
p40
aVThey don't have the time to get to know us.
p41
aa(lp42
VThere are two kinds of responses
p43
aVthat we make
p44
aVto this sort of general dissatisfaction.
p45
aVIf things aren't going right,
p46
aVthe first response is:
p47
aVlet's make more rules,
p48
aVlet's set up a set
p49
aVof detailed procedures
p50
aVto make sure that people will do the right thing.
p51
aVGive teachers scripts
p52
aVto follow in the classroom,
p53
aVso even if they don't know what they're doing
p54
aVand don't care about the welfare of our kids,
p55
aVas long as they follow the scripts,
p56
aVour kids will get educated.
p57
aVGive judges a list of mandatory sentences
p58
aVto impose for crimes,
p59
aVso that you don't need to rely
p60
aVon judges using their judgment.
p61
aVInstead, all they have to do
p62
aVis look up on the list
p63
aVwhat kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.
p64
aVImpose limits
p65
aVon what credit card companies can charge in interest
p66
aVand on what they can charge in fees.
p67
aVMore and more rules
p68
aVto protect us
p69
aVagainst an indifferent, uncaring
p70
aVset of institutions we have to deal with.
p71
aa(lp72
VOr \u2014 or maybe and \u2014
p73
aVin addition to rules,
p74
aVlet's see if we can come up
p75
aVwith some really clever incentives
p76
aVso that, even if the people we deal with
p77
aVdon't particularly want to serve our interests,
p78
aVit is in their interest
p79
aVto serve our interest \u2014
p80
aVthe magic incentives
p81
aVthat will get people to do the right thing
p82
aVeven out of pure selfishness.
p83
aVSo we offer teachers bonuses
p84
aVif the kids they teach
p85
aVscore passing grades on these big test scores
p86
aVthat are used to evaluate
p87
aVthe quality of school systems.
p88
aa(lp89
VRules and incentives \u2014
p90
aV"sticks" and "carrots."
p91
aVWe passed a bunch of rules
p92
aVto regulate the financial industry
p93
aVin response to the recent collapse.
p94
aVThere's the Dodd-Frank Act,
p95
aVthere's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency
p96
aVthat is temporarily being headed through the backdoor
p97
aVby Elizabeth Warren.
p98
aVMaybe these rules
p99
aVwill actually improve
p100
aVthe way these financial services companies behave.
p101
aVWe'll see.
p102
aVIn addition, we are struggling
p103
aVto find some way to create incentives
p104
aVfor people in the financial services industry
p105
aVthat will have them more interested
p106
aVin serving the long-term interests
p107
aVeven of their own companies,
p108
aVrather than securing short-term profits.
p109
aVSo if we find just the right incentives,
p110
aVthey'll do the right thing \u2014 as I said \u2014 selfishly,
p111
aVand if we come up with the right rules and regulations,
p112
aVthey won't drive us all over a cliff.
p113
aVAnd Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know
p114
aVthat you need to reign in the bankers.
p115
aVIf there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse
p116
aVit is that.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut what we believe,
p119
aVand what we argue in the book,
p120
aVis that there is no set of rules,
p121
aVno matter how detailed,
p122
aVno matter how specific,
p123
aVno matter how carefully monitored
p124
aVand enforced,
p125
aVthere is no set of rules
p126
aVthat will get us what we need.
p127
aVWhy? Because bankers are smart people.
p128
aVAnd, like water,
p129
aVthey will find cracks
p130
aVin any set of rules.
p131
aVYou design a set of rules that will make sure
p132
aVthat the particular reason
p133
aVwhy the financial system "almost-collapse"
p134
aVcan't happen again.
p135
aVIt is naive beyond description
p136
aVto think that having blocked
p137
aVthis source of financial collapse,
p138
aVyou have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.
p139
aVSo it's just a question of waiting for the next one
p140
aVand then marveling at how we could have been so stupid
p141
aVas not to protect ourselves against that.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat we desperately need,
p144
aVbeyond, or along with, better rules
p145
aVand reasonably smart incentives,
p146
aVis we need virtue.
p147
aVWe need character.
p148
aVWe need people who want to do the right thing.
p149
aVAnd in particular,
p150
aVthe virtue that we need most of all
p151
aVis the virtue that Aristotle called
p152
aV"practical wisdom."
p153
aVPractical wisdom
p154
aVis the moral will
p155
aVto do the right thing
p156
aVand the moral skill
p157
aVto figure out what the right thing is.
p158
aVSo Aristotle was very interested in watching
p159
aVhow the craftsmen around him worked.
p160
aVAnd he was impressed
p161
aVat how they would improvise
p162
aVnovel solutions to novel problems \u2014
p163
aVproblems that they hadn't anticipated.
p164
aVSo one example is he sees these stonemasons
p165
aVworking on the Isle of Lesbos,
p166
aVand they need to measure out
p167
aVround columns.
p168
aVWell if you think about it,
p169
aVit's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.
p170
aVSo what do they do?
p171
aVThey fashion a novel solution to the problem.
p172
aVThey created a ruler that bends,
p173
aVwhat we would call these days a tape measure \u2014
p174
aVa flexible rule,
p175
aVa rule that bends.
p176
aVAnd Aristotle said,
p177
aV"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes
p178
aVto design rounded columns,
p179
aVyou need to bend the rule."
p180
aVAnd Aristotle said
p181
aVoften in dealing with other people,
p182
aVwe need to bend the rules.
p183
aa(lp184
VDealing with other people
p185
aVdemands a kind of flexibility
p186
aVthat no set of rules can encompass.
p187
aVWise people know when and how
p188
aVto bend the rules.
p189
aVWise people know how to improvise.
p190
aVThe way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,
p191
aVthey are kind of like jazz musicians.
p192
aVThe rules are like the notes on the page,
p193
aVand that gets you started,
p194
aVbut then you dance around the notes on the page,
p195
aVcoming up with just the right combination
p196
aVfor this particular moment
p197
aVwith this particular set of fellow players.
p198
aVSo for Aristotle,
p199
aVthe kind
p200
aVof rule-bending,
p201
aVrule exception-finding and improvisation
p202
aVthat you see in skilled craftsmen
p203
aVis exactly what you need
p204
aVto be a skilled moral craftsman.
p205
aVAnd in interactions with people,
p206
aValmost all the time,
p207
aVit is this kind of flexibility that is required.
p208
aVA wise person knows when to bend the rules.
p209
aVA wise person knows when to improvise.
p210
aVAnd most important,
p211
aVa wise person does this improvising and rule-bending
p212
aVin the service of the right aims.
p213
aVIf you are a rule-bender and an improviser
p214
aVmostly to serve yourself,
p215
aVwhat you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.
p216
aVSo it matters that you do this wise practice
p217
aVin the service of others
p218
aVand not in the service of yourself.
p219
aVAnd so the will to do the right thing
p220
aVis just as important as the moral skill
p221
aVof improvisation
p222
aVand exception-finding.
p223
aVTogether they comprise practical wisdom,
p224
aVwhich Aristotle thought
p225
aVwas the master virtue.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo I'll give you an example
p228
aVof wise practice in action.
p229
aVIt's the case of Michael.
p230
aVMichael's a young guy.
p231
aVHe had a pretty low-wage job.
p232
aVHe was supporting his wife and a child,
p233
aVand the child was going to parochial school.
p234
aVThen he lost his job.
p235
aVHe panicked
p236
aVabout being able to support his family.
p237
aVOne night, he drank a little too much,
p238
aVand he robbed a cab driver \u2014
p239
aVstole 50 dollars.
p240
aVHe robbed him at gunpoint.
p241
aVIt was a toy gun.
p242
aVHe got caught. He got tried.
p243
aVHe got convicted.
p244
aVThe Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines
p245
aVrequired a minimum sentence for a crime like this
p246
aVof two years, 24 months.
p247
aVThe judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer
p248
aVthought that this made no sense.
p249
aVHe had never committed a crime before.
p250
aVHe was a responsible husband and father.
p251
aVHe had been faced with desperate circumstances.
p252
aVAll this would do is wreck a family.
p253
aVAnd so she improvised a sentence \u2014 11 months,
p254
aVand not only that,
p255
aVbut release every day to go to work.
p256
aVSpend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.
p257
aVHe did. He served out his sentence.
p258
aVHe made restitution
p259
aVand found himself a new job.
p260
aVAnd the family was united.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd it seemed on the road
p263
aVto some sort of a decent life \u2014
p264
aVa happy ending to a story
p265
aVinvolving wise improvisation
p266
aVfrom a wise judge.
p267
aVBut it turned out
p268
aVthe prosecutor was not happy
p269
aVthat Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines
p270
aVand sort of invented her own,
p271
aVand so he appealed.
p272
aVAnd he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence
p273
aVfor armed robbery.
p274
aVHe did after all have a toy gun.
p275
aVThe mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery
p276
aVis five years.
p277
aVHe won the appeal.
p278
aVMichael was sentenced to five years in prison.
p279
aVJudge Forer had to follow the law.
p280
aVAnd by the way, this appeal went through
p281
aVafter he had finished serving his sentence,
p282
aVso he was out and working at a job
p283
aVand taking care of his family
p284
aVand he had to go back into jail.
p285
aVJudge Forer did what she was required to do,
p286
aVand then she quit the bench.
p287
aVAnd Michael disappeared.
p288
aVSo that is an example,
p289
aVboth of wisdom in practice
p290
aVand the subversion of wisdom
p291
aVby rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow consider Ms. Dewey.
p294
aVMs. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.
p295
aVShe found herself listening to a consultant one day
p296
aVwho was trying to help teachers
p297
aVboost the test scores of the kids,
p298
aVso that the school
p299
aVwould reach the elite category
p300
aVin percentage of kids passing big tests.
p301
aVAll these schools in Texas compete with one another
p302
aVto achieve these milestones,
p303
aVand there are bonuses and various other treats
p304
aVthat come if you beat the other schools.
p305
aVSo here was the consultant's advice:
p306
aVfirst, don't waste your time on kids
p307
aVwho are going to pass the test no matter what you do.
p308
aVSecond, don't waste your time
p309
aVon kids who can't pass the test
p310
aVno matter what you do.
p311
aVThird, don't waste your time
p312
aVon kids who moved into the district
p313
aVtoo late for their scores to be counted.
p314
aVFocus all of your time and attention
p315
aVon the kids who are on the bubble,
p316
aVthe so-called "bubble kids" \u2014
p317
aVkids where your intervention
p318
aVcan get them just maybe over the line
p319
aVfrom failing to passing.
p320
aVSo Ms. Dewey heard this,
p321
aVand she shook her head in despair
p322
aVwhile fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on
p323
aVand nodding approvingly.
p324
aVIt's like they were about to go play a football game.
p325
aVFor Ms. Dewey,
p326
aVthis isn't why she became a teacher.
p327
aa(lp328
VNow Ken and I are not naive,
p329
aVand we understand that you need to have rules.
p330
aVYou need to have incentives.
p331
aVPeople have to make a living.
p332
aVBut the problem
p333
aVwith relying on rules and incentives
p334
aVis that they demoralize
p335
aVprofessional activity,
p336
aVand they demoralize professional activity
p337
aVin two senses.
p338
aVFirst, they demoralize the people
p339
aVwho are engaged in the activity.
p340
aVJudge Forer quits,
p341
aVand Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.
p342
aVAnd second,
p343
aVthey demoralize the activity itself.
p344
aVThe very practice is demoralized,
p345
aVand the practitioners are demoralized.
p346
aVIt creates people \u2014
p347
aVwhen you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing \u2014
p348
aVit creates people
p349
aVwho are addicted to incentives.
p350
aVThat is to say, it creates people
p351
aVwho only do things for incentives.
p352
aa(lp353
VNow the striking thing about this
p354
aVis that psychologists have known this
p355
aVfor 30 years.
p356
aVPsychologists have known
p357
aVabout the negative consequences of incentivizing everything
p358
aVfor 30 years.
p359
aVWe know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,
p360
aVthey stop caring about the drawing
p361
aVand care only about the reward.
p362
aVIf you reward kids for reading books,
p363
aVthey stop caring about what's in the books
p364
aVand only care about how long they are.
p365
aVIf you reward teachers for kids' test scores,
p366
aVthey stop caring about educating
p367
aVand only care about test preparation.
p368
aVIf you were to reward doctors
p369
aVfor doing more procedures \u2014
p370
aVwhich is the current system \u2014 they would do more.
p371
aVIf instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,
p372
aVthey will do fewer.
p373
aVWhat we want, of course,
p374
aVis doctors who do just the right amount of procedures
p375
aVand do the right amount for the right reason \u2014
p376
aVnamely, to serve the welfare of their patients.
p377
aVPsychologists have known this for decades,
p378
aVand it's time for policymakers
p379
aVto start paying attention
p380
aVand listen to psychologists a little bit,
p381
aVinstead of economists.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd it doesn't have to be this way.
p384
aVWe think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.
p385
aVWe identify one set of people
p386
aVin all of these practices
p387
aVwho we call canny outlaws.
p388
aVThese are people
p389
aVwho, being forced to operate
p390
aVin a system that demands rule-following
p391
aVand creates incentives,
p392
aVfind away around the rules,
p393
aVfind a way to subvert the rules.
p394
aVSo there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,
p395
aVand they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.
p396
aVAnd so what they do is they follow the scripts,
p397
aVbut they follow the scripts at double-time
p398
aVand squirrel away little bits of extra time
p399
aVduring which they teach in the way
p400
aVthat they actually know is effective.
p401
aVSo these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,
p402
aVand they're incredibly admirable,
p403
aVbut there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity
p404
aVin the face of a system
p405
aVthat either roots them out
p406
aVor grinds them down.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo canny outlaws are better than nothing,
p409
aVbut it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw
p410
aVsustaining that for an indefinite period of time.
p411
aVMore hopeful
p412
aVare people we call system-changers.
p413
aVThese are people who are looking
p414
aVnot to dodge the system's rules and regulations,
p415
aVbut to transform the system,
p416
aVand we talk about several.
p417
aVOne in particular
p418
aVis a judge named Robert Russell.
p419
aVAnd one day he was faced
p420
aVwith the case of Gary Pettengill.
p421
aVPettengill was a 23-year-old vet
p422
aVwho had planned to make the army a career,
p423
aVbut then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,
p424
aVand that forced him to take a medical discharge.
p425
aVHe was married, he had a third kid on the way,
p426
aVhe suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,
p427
aVand recurrent nightmares,
p428
aVand he had started using marijuana
p429
aVto ease some of the symptoms.
p430
aVHe was only able to get part-time work because of his back,
p431
aVand so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table
p432
aVand take care of his family.
p433
aVSo he started selling marijuana.
p434
aVHe was busted in a drug sweep.
p435
aVHis family was kicked out of their apartment,
p436
aVand the welfare system
p437
aVwas threatening to take away his kids.
p438
aa(lp439
VUnder normal sentencing procedures,
p440
aVJudge Russell would have had little choice
p441
aVbut to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time
p442
aVas a drug felon.
p443
aVBut Judge Russell did have an alternative.
p444
aVAnd that's because he was in a special court.
p445
aVHe was in a court called the Veterans' Court.
p446
aVIn the Veterans' Court \u2014
p447
aVthis was the first of its kind in the United States.
p448
aVJudge Russell created the Veterans' Court.
p449
aVIt was a court only for veterans
p450
aVwho had broken the law.
p451
aVAnd he had created it exactly because
p452
aVmandatory sentencing laws
p453
aVwere taking the judgment out of judging.
p454
aVNo one wanted non-violent offenders \u2014
p455
aVand especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot \u2014
p456
aVto be thrown into prison.
p457
aVThey wanted to do something about what we all know,
p458
aVnamely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.
p459
aVAnd what the Veterans' Court did,
p460
aVwas it treated each criminal as an individual,
p461
aVtried to get inside their problems,
p462
aVtried to fashion responses to their crimes
p463
aVthat helped them to rehabilitate themselves,
p464
aVand didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.
p465
aVStayed with them, followed up on them,
p466
aVmade sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
p467
aVhad been jointly developed
p468
aVto get them over the hump.
p469
aa(lp470
VThere are now 22 cities
p471
aVthat have Veterans' Courts like this.
p472
aVWhy has the idea spread?
p473
aVWell, one reason is
p474
aVthat Judge Russell
p475
aVhas now seen 108 vets
p476
aVin his Veterans' Court
p477
aVas of February of this year,
p478
aVand out of 108,
p479
aVguess how many have gone back through
p480
aVthe revolving door of justice
p481
aVinto prison.
p482
aVNone. None.
p483
aVAnyone would glom onto
p484
aVa criminal justice system
p485
aVthat has this kind of a record.
p486
aVSo here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.
p487
aa(lp488
VThere's a banker
p489

aVthat encouraged bankers \u2014 I know this is hard to believe \u2014
p491
aVencouraged bankers who worked there to do well
p492
aVby doing good for their low-income clients.
p493
aVThe bank helped finance the rebuilding
p494
aVof what was otherwise a dying community.
p495
aVThough their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,
p496
aVthe default rate was extremely low.
p497
aVThe bank was profitable.
p498
aVThe bankers stayed with their loan recipients.
p499
aVThey didn't make loans and then sell the loans.
p500
aVThey serviced the loans.
p501
aVThey made sure that their loan recipients
p502
aVwere staying up with their payments.
p503
aVBanking hasn't always been
p504
aVthe way we read about it now in the newspapers.
p505
aVEven Goldman Sachs
p506
aVonce used to serve clients,
p507
aVbefore it turned into an institution
p508
aVthat serves only itself.
p509
aVBanking wasn't always this way,
p510
aVand it doesn't have to be this way.
p511

VSo there are examples like this in medicine \u2014
p513
aVdoctors at Harvard
p514
aVwho are trying to transform medical education,
p515
aVso that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion
p516
aVand loss of empathy,
p517
aVwhich characterizes most medical students
p518
aVin the course of their medical training.
p519
aVAnd the way they do it is to give third-year medical students
p520
aVpatients who they follow for an entire year.
p521
aVSo the patients are not organ systems,
p522
aVand they're not diseases;
p523
aVthey're people, people with lives.
p524
aVAnd in order to be an effective doctor,
p525
aVyou need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.
p526
aVIn addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,
p527
aVmentoring of one student by another,
p528
aVof all the students by the doctors,
p529
aVand the result is a generation \u2014 we hope \u2014 of doctors
p530
aVwho do have time for the people they treat.
p531
aVWe'll see.
p532
aa(lp533
VSo there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.
p534
aVEach of them shows that it is possible
p535
aVto build on and nurture character
p536
aVand keep a profession
p537
aVtrue to its proper mission \u2014
p538
aVwhat Aristotle would have called its proper telos.
p539
aVAnd Ken and I believe
p540
aVthat this is what practitioners actually want.
p541
aVPeople want to be allowed
p542
aVto be virtuous.
p543
aVThey want to have permission to do the right thing.
p544
aVThey don't want to feel
p545
aVlike they need to take a shower
p546
aVto get the moral grime off their bodies everyday
p547
aVwhen they come home from work.
p548
aa(lp549
VAristotle thought that practical wisdom
p550
aVwas the key to happiness,
p551
aVand he was right.
p552
aVThere's now a lot of research being done in psychology
p553
aVon what makes people happy,
p554
aVand the two things that jump out in study after study \u2014
p555
aVI know this will come as a shock to all of you \u2014
p556
aVthe two things that matter most to happiness
p557
aVare love and work.
p558
aVLove: managing successfully
p559
aVrelations with the people who are close to you
p560
aVand with the communities of which you are a part.
p561
aVWork: engaging in activities
p562
aVthat are meaningful and satisfying.
p563
aVIf you have that, good close relations with other people,
p564
aVwork that's meaningful and fulfilling,
p565
aVyou don't much need anything else.
p566
aa(lp567
VWell, to love well and to work well,
p568
aVyou need wisdom.
p569
aVRules and incentives don't tell you
p570
aVhow to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,
p571
aVhow to be a good spouse,
p572
aVor how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer
p573
aVor a good teacher.
p574
aVRules and incentives
p575
aVare no substitutes for wisdom.
p576
aVIndeed, we argue,
p577
aVthere is no substitute for wisdom.
p578
aVAnd so practical wisdom
p579
aVdoes not require
p580
aVheroic acts of self-sacrifice
p581
aVon the part of practitioners.
p582
aVIn giving us the will and the skill
p583
aVto do the right thing \u2014 to do right by others \u2014
p584
aVpractical wisdom also gives us
p585
aVthe will and the skill
p586
aVto do right by ourselves.
