VI used to be a Malthusian.
p4
aVThis was my mental model of the world:
p5
aVexploding population, small planet;
p6
aVit's going to lead to ugly things.
p7
aVBut I'm moving past Malthus,
p8
aVbecause I think that we just might be about 150 years
p9
aVfrom a kind of new enlightenment.
p10
aa(lp11
VHere's why.
p12
aVThis is the U.N.'s population data,
p13
aVyou may have seen, for the world.
p14
aVAnd the world's population expected to top out
p15
aVat something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.
p16
aVAnd after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.
p17
aVSo what then?
p18
aVMost of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.
p19
aVSo a lot of economists
p20
aVlook at declining population
p21
aVand expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.
p22
aVBut a declining population is going to have
p23
aVat least two very beneficial economic effects.
p24
aa(lp25
VOne: fewer people on a fixed amount of land
p26
aVmake investing in property a bad bet.
p27
aVIn the cities, a lot of the cost of property
p28
aVis actually wrapped up in its speculative value.
p29
aVTake away land speculation,
p30
aVprice of land drops.
p31
aVAnd that begins to lift a heavy burden
p32
aVoff the world's poor.
p33
aa(lp34
VNumber two: a declining population
p35
aVmeans scarce labor.
p36
aVScarce labor drives wages.
p37
aVAs wages increase
p38
aVthat also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.
p39
aVNow I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.
p40
aVBut look what happened in Europe
p41
aVafter the plague:
p42
aVrising wages,
p43
aVland reform,
p44
aVtechnological innovation,
p45
aVbirth of the middle class;
p46
aVand after that, forward-looking social movements
p47
aVlike the Renaissance,
p48
aVand later the Enlightenment.
p49
aa(lp50
VMost of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward,
p51
aVromanticizing the past.
p52
aVAll of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,
p53
aVand descend through a kind of profligate present
p54
aVto a very ugly future.
p55
aVSo human history is viewed
p56
aVas sort of this downhill slide
p57
aVfrom the good old days.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut I think we're in for another change,
p60
aVabout two generations after the top of that curve,
p61
aVonce the effects of a declining population
p62
aVstart to settle in.
p63
aVAt that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,
p64
aVinstead of the nasty, brutish past.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo why does this matter?
p67
aVWhy talk about social-economic movements
p68
aVthat may be more than a century away?
p69
aVBecause transitions are dangerous times.
p70
aVWhen land owners start to lose money,
p71
aVand labor demands more pay,
p72
aVthere are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.
p73
aVFear for the future leads to some rash decisions.
p74
aVIf we have a positive view about the future
p75
aVthen we may be able to accelerate through that turn,
p76
aVinstead of careening off a cliff.
p77
aa(lp78
VIf we can make it through the next 150 years,
p79
aVI think that your great great grandchildren
p80
aVwill forget all about Malthus.
p81
aVAnd instead, they'll be planning for the future
p82
aVand starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.
p83
aVThank you.
