VI want you to look around the room for a minute
p4
aVand try to find the most paranoid person here \u2014
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd then I want you to point at that person for me.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VOK, don't actually do it.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VBut, as an organizational psychologist,
p17
aVI spend a lot of time in workplaces,
p18
aVand I find paranoia everywhere.
p19
aVParanoia is caused by people that I call "takers."
p20
aVTakers are self-serving in their interactions.
p21
aVIt's all about what can you do for me.
p22
aVThe opposite is a giver.
p23
aVIt's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking,
p24
aV"What can I do for you?"
p25
aa(lp26
VI wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style.
p27
aVWe all have moments of giving and taking.
p28
aVYour style is how you treat most of the people most of the time,
p29
aVyour default.
p30
aVI have a short test you can take
p31
aVto figure out if you're more of a giver or a taker,
p32
aVand you can take it right now.
p33
aa(lp34
V[The Narcissist Test]
p35
aa(lp36
V[Step 1: Take a moment to think about yourself.]
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
V[Step 2: If you made it to Step 2, you are not a narcissist.]
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is the only thing I will say today that has no data behind it,
p45
aVbut I am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon,
p46
aVthe more worried we should be that you're a taker.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VOf course, not all takers are narcissists.
p51
aVSome are just givers who got burned one too many times.
p52
aVThen there's another kind of taker that we won't be addressing today,
p53
aVand that's called a psychopath.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VI was curious, though, about how common these extremes are,
p58
aVand so I surveyed over 30,000 people across industries
p59
aVaround the world's cultures.
p60
aVAnd I found that most people are right in the middle
p61
aVbetween giving and taking.
p62
aVThey choose this third style called "matching."
p63
aVIf you're a matcher, you try to keep an even balance of give and take:
p64
aVquid pro quo \u2014 I'll do something for you if you do something for me.
p65
aVAnd that seems like a safe way to live your life.
p66
aVBut is it the most effective and productive way to live your life?
p67
aVThe answer to that question is a very definitive ...
p68
aVmaybe.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VI studied dozens of organizations,
p73
aVthousands of people.
p74
aVI had engineers measuring their productivity.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VI looked at medical students' grades \u2014
p79
aVeven salespeople's revenue.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd, unexpectedly,
p84
aVthe worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers.
p85
aVThe engineers who got the least work done
p86
aVwere the ones who did more favors than they got back.
p87
aVThey were so busy doing other people's jobs,
p88
aVthey literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed.
p89
aVIn medical school, the lowest grades belong to the students
p90
aVwho agree most strongly with statements like,
p91
aV"I love helping others,"
p92
aVwhich suggests the doctor you ought to trust
p93
aVis the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then in sales, too, the lowest revenue accrued
p98
aVin the most generous salespeople.
p99
aVI actually reached out to one of those salespeople
p100
aVwho had a very high giver score.
p101
aVAnd I asked him, "Why do you suck at your job \u2014"
p102
aVI didn't ask it that way, but \u2014
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V"What's the cost of generosity in sales?"
p107
aVAnd he said, "Well, I just care so deeply about my customers
p108
aVthat I would never sell them one of our crappy products."
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo just out of curiosity,
p113
aVhow many of you self-identify more as givers than takers or matchers?
p114
aVRaise your hands.
p115
aVOK, it would have been more before we talked about these data.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut actually, it turns out there's a twist here,
p118
aVbecause givers are often sacrificing themselves,
p119
aVbut they make their organizations better.
p120
aVWe have a huge body of evidence \u2014
p121
aVmany, many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior
p122
aVthat exists in a team or an organization \u2014
p123
aVand the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge
p124
aVand providing mentoring,
p125
aVthe better organizations do on every metric we can measure:
p126
aVhigher profits, customer satisfaction, employee retention \u2014
p127
aVeven lower operating expenses.
p128
aVSo givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people
p129
aVand improve the team,
p130
aVand then, unfortunately, they suffer along the way.
p131
aVI want to talk about what it takes
p132
aVto build cultures where givers actually get to succeed.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo I wondered, then, if givers are the worst performers,
p135
aVwho are the best performers?
p136
aVLet me start with the good news: it's not the takers.
p137
aVTakers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs.
p138
aVAnd they fall at the hands of matchers.
p139
aVIf you're a matcher, you believe in "An eye for an eye" \u2014 a just world.
p140
aVAnd so when you meet a taker,
p141
aVyou feel like it's your mission in life
p142
aVto just punish the hell out of that person.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd that way justice gets served.
p147
aa(lp148
VWell, most people are matchers.
p149
aVAnd that means if you're a taker,
p150
aVit tends to catch up with you eventually;
p151
aVwhat goes around will come around.
p152
aVAnd so the logical conclusion is:
p153
aVit must be the matchers who are the best performers.
p154
aVBut they're not.
p155
aVIn every job, in every organization I've ever studied,
p156
aVthe best results belong to the givers again.
p157
aa(lp158
VTake a look at some data I gathered from hundreds of salespeople,
p159
aVtracking their revenue.
p160
aVWhat you can see is that the givers go to both extremes.
p161
aVThey make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue,
p162
aVbut also the highest revenue.
p163
aVThe same patterns were true for engineers' productivity
p164
aVand medical students' grades.
p165
aVGivers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top
p166
aVof every success metric that I can track.
p167
aVWhich raises the question:
p168
aVHow do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel?
p169
aVI want to talk about how to do that, not just in businesses,
p170
aVbut also in nonprofits, schools \u2014
p171
aVeven governments.
p172
aVAre you ready?
p173
aa(lp174
V(Cheers)
p175
aa(lp176
VI was going to do it anyway, but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VThe first thing that's really critical
p181
aVis to recognize that givers are your most valuable people,
p182
aVbut if they're not careful, they burn out.
p183
aVSo you have to protect the givers in your midst.
p184
aVAnd I learned a great lesson about this from Fortune's best networker.
p185
aVIt's the guy, not the cat.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VHis name is Adam Rifkin.
p190
aVHe's a very successful serial entrepreneur
p191
aVwho spends a huge amount of his time helping other people.
p192
aVAnd his secret weapon is the five-minute favor.
p193
aVAdam said, "You don't have to be Mother Teresa or Gandhi
p194
aVto be a giver.
p195
aVYou just have to find small ways to add large value
p196
aVto other people's lives."
p197
aVThat could be as simple as making an introduction
p198
aVbetween two people who could benefit from knowing each other.
p199
aVIt could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback.
p200
aVOr It might be even something as basic as saying,
p201
aV"You know,
p202
aVI'm going to try and figure out
p203
aVif I can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed."
p204
aVAnd those five-minute favors are really critical
p205
aVto helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe second thing that matters
p208
aVif you want to build a culture where givers succeed,
p209
aVis you actually need a culture where help-seeking is the norm;
p210
aVwhere people ask a lot.
p211
aVThis may hit a little too close to home for some of you.
p212
aa(lp213
V[So in all your relationships, you always have to be the giver?]
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VWhat you see with successful givers
p218
aVis they recognize that it's OK to be a receiver, too.
p219
aVIf you run an organization, we can actually make this easier.
p220
aVWe can make it easier for people to ask for help.
p221
aVA couple colleagues and I studied hospitals.
p222
aVWe found that on certain floors, nurses did a lot of help-seeking,
p223
aVand on other floors, they did very little of it.
p224
aVThe factor that stood out on the floors where help-seeking was common,
p225
aVwhere it was the norm,
p226
aVwas there was just one nurse whose sole job it was
p227
aVto help other nurses on the unit.
p228
aVWhen that role was available,
p229
aVnurses said, "It's not embarrassing, it's not vulnerable to ask for help \u2014
p230
aVit's actually encouraged."
p231
aa(lp232
VHelp-seeking isn't important just for protecting the success
p233
aVand the well-being of givers.
p234
aVIt's also critical to getting more people to act like givers,
p235
aVbecause the data say
p236
aVthat somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of all giving in organizations
p237
aVstarts with a request.
p238
aVBut a lot of people don't ask.
p239
aVThey don't want to look incompetent,
p240
aVthey don't know where to turn, they don't want to burden others.
p241
aVYet if nobody ever asks for help,
p242
aVyou have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization
p243
aVwho would love to step up and contribute,
p244
aVif they only knew who could benefit and how.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut I think the most important thing,
p247
aVif you want to build a culture of successful givers,
p248
aVis to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team.
p249
aVI figured, you want a culture of productive generosity,
p250
aVyou should hire a bunch of givers.
p251
aVBut I was surprised to discover, actually, that that was not right \u2014
p252
aVthat the negative impact of a taker on a culture
p253
aVis usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver.
p254
aVThink about it this way:
p255
aVone bad apple can spoil a barrel,
p256
aVbut one good egg just does not make a dozen.
p257
aVI don't know what that means \u2014
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VBut I hope you do.
p262
aa(lp263
VNo \u2014 let even one taker into a team,
p264
aVand you will see that the givers will stop helping.
p265
aVThey'll say, "I'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks.
p266
aVWhy should I contribute?"
p267
aVWhereas if you let one giver into a team,
p268
aVyou don't get an explosion of generosity.
p269
aVMore often, people are like,
p270
aV"Great! That person can do all our work."
p271
aVSo, effective hiring and screening and team building
p272
aVis not about bringing in the givers;
p273
aVit's about weeding out the takers.
p274
aVIf you can do that well,
p275
aVyou'll be left with givers and matchers.
p276
aVThe givers will be generous
p277
aVbecause they don't have to worry about the consequences.
p278
aVAnd the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo how do you catch a taker before it's too late?
p281
aVWe're actually pretty bad at figuring out who's a taker,
p282
aVespecially on first impressions.
p283
aVThere's a personality trait that throws us off.
p284
aVIt's called agreeableness,
p285
aVone the major dimensions of personality across cultures.
p286
aVAgreeable people are warm and friendly, they're nice, they're polite.
p287
aVYou find a lot of them in Canada \u2014
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VWhere there was actually a national contest
p292
aVto come up with a new Canadian slogan and fill in the blank,
p293
aV"As Canadian as ..."
p294
aVI thought the winning entry was going to be,
p295
aV"As Canadian as maple syrup," or, "... ice hockey."
p296
aVBut no, Canadians voted for their new national slogan to be \u2014
p297
aVI kid you not \u2014
p298
aV"As Canadian as possible under the circumstances."
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VNow for those of you who are highly agreeable,
p303
aVor maybe slightly Canadian,
p304
aVyou get this right away.
p305
aVHow could I ever say I'm any one thing
p306
aVwhen I'm constantly adapting to try to please other people?
p307
aVDisagreeable people do less of it.
p308
aVThey're more critical, skeptical, challenging,
p309
aVand far more likely than their peers to go to law school.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VThat's not a joke, that's actually an empirical fact.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VSo I always assumed that agreeable people were givers
p318
aVand disagreeable people were takers.
p319
aVBut then I gathered the data,
p320
aVand I was stunned to find no correlation between those traits,
p321
aVbecause it turns out that agreeableness-disagreeableness
p322
aVis your outer veneer:
p323
aVHow pleasant is it to interact with you?
p324
aVWhereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives:
p325
aVWhat are your values? What are your intentions toward others?
p326
aa(lp327
VIf you really want to judge people accurately,
p328
aVyou have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting for,
p329
aVand draw a two-by-two.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VThe agreeable givers are easy to spot:
p334
aVthey say yes to everything.
p335
aVThe disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly,
p336
aValthough you might call them by a slightly different name.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VWe forget about the other two combinations.
p341
aVThere are disagreeable givers in our organizations.
p342
aVThere are people who are gruff and tough on the surface
p343
aVbut underneath have others' best interests at heart.
p344
aVOr as an engineer put it,
p345
aV"Oh, disagreeable givers \u2014
p346
aVlike somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system."
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VIf that helps you.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VDisagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in our organizations,
p355
aVbecause they're the ones who give the critical feedback
p356
aVthat no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear.
p357
aVWe need to do a much better job valuing these people
p358
aVas opposed to writing them off early,
p359
aVand saying, "Eh, kind of prickly,
p360
aVmust be a selfish taker."
p361
aa(lp362
VThe other combination we forget about is the deadly one \u2014
p363
aVthe agreeable taker, also known as the faker.
p364
aVThis is the person who's nice to your face,
p365
aVand then will stab you right in the back.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process
p370
aVis to ask the question,
p371
aV"Can you give me the names of four people
p372
aVwhose careers you have fundamentally improved?"
p373
aVThe takers will give you four names,
p374
aVand they will all be more influential than them,
p375
aVbecause takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down.
p376
aVGivers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy,
p377
aVwho don't have as much power,
p378
aVwho can do them no good.
p379
aVAnd let's face it, you all know you can learn a lot about character
p380
aVby watching how someone treats their restaurant server
p381
aVor their Uber driver.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo if we do all this well,
p384
aVif we can weed takers out of organizations,
p385
aVif we can make it safe to ask for help,
p386
aVif we can protect givers from burnout
p387
aVand make it OK for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals
p388
aVas well as trying to help other people,
p389
aVwe can actually change the way that people define success.
p390
aVInstead of saying it's all about winning a competition,
p391
aVpeople will realize success is really more about contribution.
p392
aa(lp393
VI believe that the most meaningful way to succeed
p394
aVis to help other people succeed.
p395
aVAnd if we can spread that belief,
p396
aVwe can actually turn paranoia upside down.
p397
aVThere's a name for that.
p398
aVIt's called "pronoia."
p399
aVPronoia is the delusional belief
p400
aVthat other people are plotting your well-being.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VThat they're going around behind your back
p405
aVand saying exceptionally glowing things about you.
p406
aVThe great thing about a culture of givers is that's not a delusion \u2014
p407
aVit's reality.
p408
aVI want to live in a world where givers succeed,
p409
aVand I hope you will help me create that world.
p410
aa(lp411
VThank you.
