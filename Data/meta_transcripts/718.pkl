VThe key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"
p4
aVIt's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.
p5
aVWe've known about fusion since 1920,
p6
aVwhen Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington
p7
aVand the British Association for the Advancement of Science
p8
aVconjectured that that's why the sun shines.
p9
aa(lp10
VI've always been very worried about resource.
p11
aVI don't know about you, but
p12
aVwhen my mother gave me food,
p13
aVI always sorted the ones I disliked
p14
aVfrom the ones I liked.
p15
aVAnd I ate the disliked ones first,
p16
aVbecause the ones you like, you want to save.
p17
aVAnd as a child you're always worried about resource.
p18
aVAnd once it was sort of explained to me
p19
aVhow fast we were using up the world's resources,
p20
aVI got very upset,
p21
aVabout as upset as I did when I realized
p22
aVthat the Earth will only last about five billion years
p23
aVbefore it's swallowed by the sun.
p24
aVBig events in my life,
p25
aVa strange child.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VEnergy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.
p29
aVThe countries that make a lot of money out of energy
p30
aVhave something underneath them.
p31
aVCoal-powered industrial revolution in this country \u2014
p32
aVoil, gas, sorry.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVGas, I'm probably the only person
p35
aVwho really enjoys it when Mister Putin
p36
aVturns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.
p37
aa(lp38
VWe're really dominated now
p39
aVby those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.
p40
aVAnd as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty
p41
aVin the Third World, in the developing world,
p42
aVwe're using energy faster and faster.
p43
aVAnd those resources are going away.
p44
aVAnd the way we'll make energy in the future
p45
aVis not from resource,
p46
aVit's really from knowledge.
p47
aVIf you look 50 years into the future,
p48
aVthe way we probably will be making energy
p49
aVis probably one of these three,
p50
aVwith some wind, with some other things,
p51
aVbut these are going to be the base load energy drivers.
p52
aa(lp53
VSolar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.
p54
aVBut we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar
p55
aVthe base load energy supply for the world.
p56
aVFission.
p57
aVOur government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.
p58
aVThey're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,
p59
aVand probably more after that.
p60
aVChina is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.
p61
aVBecause they know that that is one sure way
p62
aVto do carbon-free energy.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,
p65
aVthe perfect energy source is one
p66
aVthat doesn't take up much space,
p67
aVhas a virtually inexhaustible supply,
p68
aVis safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,
p69
aVdoesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:
p70
aVit's fusion.
p71
aVBut there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.
p72
aVFusion is very hard to do.
p73
aVWe've been trying for 50 years.
p74
aa(lp75
VOkay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.
p76
aVAnd sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVI was a strange child.
p79
aVNuclear energy comes for a simple reason.
p80
aVThe most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.
p81
aVIt's a medium-sized nucleus.
p82
aVAnd you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.
p83
aVSo, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.
p84
aVBut small atoms want to join together,
p85
aVsmall nuclei want to join together
p86
aVto make bigger ones to go towards iron.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd you can get energy out this way.
p89
aVAnd indeed that's exactly what stars do.
p90
aVIn the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium
p91
aVand then helium together to make carbon,
p92
aVto make oxygen, all the things that you're made of
p93
aVare made in the middle of stars.
p94
aVBut it's a hard process to do
p95
aVbecause, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,
p96
aValmost by definition.
p97
aVAnd there is one reaction
p98
aVthat's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.
p99
aVIt's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:
p100
aVdeuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,
p101
aVwhich you can get from seawater,
p102
aVand tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.
p103
aa(lp104
VThese two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.
p105
aVAnd you push them together and they repel.
p106
aVBut when you get them close enough,
p107
aVsomething called the strong force starts to act
p108
aVand pulls them together.
p109
aVSo, most of the time they repel.
p110
aVYou get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point
p111
aVthe strong force grips them together.
p112
aVFor a moment they become helium 5,
p113
aVbecause they've got five particles inside them.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together
p116
aVmakes helium 5.
p117
aVHelium splits out, and a neutron comes out
p118
aVand lots of energy comes out.
p119
aVIf you can get something to about 150 million degrees,
p120
aVthings will be rattling around so fast
p121
aVthat every time they collide in just the right configuration,
p122
aVthis will happen, and it will release energy.
p123
aVAnd that energy is what powers fusion.
p124
aVAnd it's this reaction that we want to do.
p125
aa(lp126
VThere is one trickiness about this reaction.
p127
aVWell, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,
p128
aVbut there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
p129
aVIt's pretty hot.
p130
aVThe trickiness about the reaction is that
p131
aVtritium doesn't exist in nature.
p132
aVYou have to make it from something else.
p133
aVAnd you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,
p134
aVthat's lithium 6, plus a neutron,
p135
aVwill give you more helium, plus tritium.
p136
aVAnd that's the way you make your tritium.
p137
aVBut fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,
p138
aVyou've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, why the hell would we bother to do this?
p141
aVThis is basically why we would bother to do it.
p142
aVIf you just plot how much fuel
p143
aVwe've got left, in units of
p144
aVpresent world consumption.
p145
aVAnd as you go across there you see
p146
aVa few tens of years of oil \u2014 the blue line, by the way,
p147
aVis the lowest estimate of existing resources.
p148
aVAnd the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd as you go across there you will see
p151
aVthat we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years
p152
aVof fossil fuels left.
p153
aVAnd god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,
p154
aVbecause it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.
p155
aVAnd then we get to uranium.
p156
aVAnd with current reactor technology
p157
aVwe really don't have very much uranium.
p158
aVAnd we will have to extract uranium from sea water,
p159
aVwhich is the yellow line,
p160
aVto make conventional nuclear power stations
p161
aVactually do very much for us.
p162
aVThis is a bit shocking, because in fact our government
p163
aVis relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,
p164
aVand do all those kind of things.
p165
aa(lp166
VTo go any further you would have to have breeder technology.
p167
aVAnd breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.
p168
aVThe big thing, on the right,
p169
aVis the lithium we have in the world.
p170
aVAnd lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.
p171
aVAnd we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
p172
aVEverybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
p173
aVIs it cost-competitive?
p174
aVWe make estimates of what we think it would cost
p175
aVto actually make a fusion power plant.
p176
aVAnd we get within about the same price
p177
aVas current electricity.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo, how would we make it?
p180
aVWe have to hold something at 150 million degrees.
p181
aVAnd, in fact, we've done this.
p182
aVWe hold it with a magnetic field.
p183
aVAnd inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,
p184
aVright in the middle is 150 million degrees.
p185
aVIt boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.
p186
aVAnd in fact we can make fusion happen.
p187
aVAnd just down the road, this is JET.
p188
aVIt's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
p189
aa(lp190
VWhen people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,
p191
aVI say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
p192
aVWe can do fusion. In the center of this device
p193
aVwe made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.
p194
aVAnd in 2013 we're going to fire it up again
p195
aVand break all those records.
p196
aVBut that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.
p197
aVWe've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.
p198
aVBecause we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.
p199
aVThis is the device we're building now.
p200
aa(lp201
VIt gets very expensive to do this research.
p202
aVIt turns out you can't do fusion on a table top
p203
aVdespite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?
p204
aVYou can't. You have to do it in a very big device.
p205
aVMore than half the world's population is involved in building this device
p206
aVin southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.
p207
aVSeven nations are involved in building this.
p208
aVIt's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.
p209
aVBut that's not electricity yet.
p210
aVWe have to get to this.
p211
aVWe have to get to a power plant.
p212
aVWe have to start putting electricity on the grid
p213
aVin this very complex technology.
p214
aVAnd I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.
p215
aVBut at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
p216
aa(lp217
VI wish this were different. We really need it now.
p218
aVWe're going to have a problem with power
p219
aVin the next five years in this country.
p220
aVSo 2030 looks like an infinity away.
p221
aVBut we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,
p222
aVget fusion to happen.
p223
aVI wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.
p224
aVBut this is what we're aiming at,
p225
aVsometime in the 2030s \u2014
p226
aVreal electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.
