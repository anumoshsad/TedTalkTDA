VRight now
p4
aVyou have a movie playing inside your head.
p5
aVIt's an amazing multi-track movie.
p6
aVIt has 3D vision and surround sound
p7
aVfor what you're seeing and hearing right now,
p8
aVbut that's just the start of it.
p9
aVYour movie has smell and taste and touch.
p10
aVIt has a sense of your body,
p11
aVpain, hunger, orgasms.
p12
aVIt has emotions,
p13
aVanger and happiness.
p14
aVIt has memories, like scenes from your childhood
p15
aVplaying before you.
p16
aVAnd it has this constant voiceover narrative
p17
aVin your stream of conscious thinking.
p18
aVAt the heart of this movie is you
p19
aVexperiencing all this directly.
p20
aVThis movie is your stream of consciousness,
p21
aVthe subject of experience
p22
aVof the mind and the world.
p23
aa(lp24
VConsciousness is one of the fundamental facts
p25
aVof human existence.
p26
aVEach of us is conscious.
p27
aVWe all have our own inner movie,
p28
aVyou and you and you.
p29
aVThere's nothing we know about more directly.
p30
aVAt least, I know about my consciousness directly.
p31
aVI can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
p32
aa(lp33
VConsciousness also is what makes life worth living.
p34
aVIf we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives
p35
aVwould have meaning or value.
p36
aVBut at the same time, it's the most
p37
aVmysterious phenomenon in the universe.
p38
aVWhy are we conscious?
p39
aVWhy do we have these inner movies?
p40
aVWhy aren't we just robots
p41
aVwho process all this input,
p42
aVproduce all that output,
p43
aVwithout experiencing the inner movie at all?
p44
aVRight now, nobody knows the answers
p45
aVto those questions.
p46
aVI'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness
p47
aVinto science, some radical ideas may be needed.
p48
aa(lp49
VSome people say a science of consciousness
p50
aVis impossible.
p51
aVScience, by its nature, is objective.
p52
aVConsciousness, by its nature, is subjective.
p53
aVSo there can never be a science of consciousness.
p54
aVFor much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
p55
aVPsychologists studied behavior objectively,
p56
aVneuroscientists studied the brain objectively,
p57
aVand nobody even mentioned consciousness.
p58
aVEven 30 years ago, when TED got started,
p59
aVthere was very little scientific work
p60
aVon consciousness.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, about 20 years ago,
p63
aVall that began to change.
p64
aVNeuroscientists like Francis Crick
p65
aVand physicists like Roger Penrose
p66
aVsaid now is the time for science
p67
aVto attack consciousness.
p68
aVAnd since then, there's been a real explosion,
p69
aVa flowering of scientific work
p70
aVon consciousness.
p71
aVAnd this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
p72
aVBut it also has some fundamental
p73
aVlimitations so far.
p74
aVThe centerpiece
p75
aVof the science of consciousness in recent years
p76
aVhas been the search for correlations,
p77
aVcorrelations between certain areas of the brain
p78
aVand certain states of consciousness.
p79
aVWe saw some of this kind of work
p80
aVfrom Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work
p81
aVshe presented just a few minutes ago.
p82
aVNow we understand much better, for example,
p83
aVthe kinds of brain areas that go along with
p84
aVthe conscious experience of seeing faces
p85
aVor of feeling pain
p86
aVor of feeling happy.
p87
aVBut this is still a science of correlations.
p88
aVIt's not a science of explanations.
p89
aVWe know that these brain areas
p90
aVgo along with certain kinds of conscious experience,
p91
aVbut we don't know why they do.
p92
aVI like to put this by saying
p93
aVthat this kind of work from neuroscience
p94
aVis answering some of the questions
p95
aVwe want answered about consciousness,
p96
aVthe questions about what certain brain areas do
p97
aVand what they correlate with.
p98
aVBut in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
p99
aVNo knock on the neuroscientists.
p100
aVThere are no truly easy problems with consciousness.
p101
aVBut it doesn't address the real mystery
p102
aVat the core of this subject:
p103
aVwhy is it that all that physical processing in a brain
p104
aVshould be accompanied by consciousness at all?
p105
aVWhy is there this inner subjective movie?
p106
aVRight now, we don't really have a bead on that.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd you might say,
p109
aVlet's just give neuroscience a few years.
p110
aVIt'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon
p111
aVlike traffic jams, like hurricanes,
p112
aVlike life, and we'll figure it out.
p113
aVThe classical cases of emergence
p114
aVare all cases of emergent behavior,
p115
aVhow a traffic jam behaves,
p116
aVhow a hurricane functions,
p117
aVhow a living organism reproduces
p118
aVand adapts and metabolizes,
p119
aVall questions about objective functioning.
p120
aVYou could apply that to the human brain
p121
aVin explaining some of the behaviors
p122
aVand the functions of the human brain
p123
aVas emergent phenomena:
p124
aVhow we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,
p125
aVall these questions about behavior.
p126
aVBut when it comes to consciousness,
p127
aVquestions about behavior
p128
aVare among the easy problems.
p129
aVWhen it comes to the hard problem,
p130
aVthat's the question of why is it
p131
aVthat all this behavior
p132
aVis accompanied by subjective experience?
p133
aVAnd here, the standard paradigm
p134
aVof emergence,
p135
aVeven the standard paradigms of neuroscience,
p136
aVdon't really, so far, have that much to say.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
p139
aVI want a scientific theory of consciousness
p140
aVthat works,
p141
aVand for a long time, I banged my head
p142
aVagainst the wall
p143
aVlooking for a theory of consciousness
p144
aVin purely physical terms
p145
aVthat would work.
p146
aVBut I eventually came to the conclusion
p147
aVthat that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
p148
aVIt's a long story,
p149
aVbut the core idea is just that what you get
p150
aVfrom purely reductionist explanations
p151
aVin physical terms, in brain-based terms,
p152
aVis stories about the functioning of a system,
p153
aVits structure, its dynamics,
p154
aVthe behavior it produces,
p155
aVgreat for solving the easy problems \u2014
p156
aVhow we behave, how we function \u2014
p157
aVbut when it comes to subjective experience \u2014
p158
aVwhy does all this feel like something from the inside? \u2014
p159
aVthat's something fundamentally new,
p160
aVand it's always a further question.
p161
aVSo I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
p162
aVWe've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,
p163
aVwe're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,
p164
aVchemistry explains biology,
p165
aVbiology explains parts of psychology.
p166
aVBut consciousness
p167
aVdoesn't seem to fit into this picture.
p168
aVOn the one hand, it's a datum
p169
aVthat we're conscious.
p170
aVOn the other hand, we don't know how
p171
aVto accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.
p172
aVSo I think consciousness right now
p173
aVis a kind of anomaly,
p174
aVone that we need to integrate
p175
aVinto our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
p176
aVFaced with an anomaly like this,
p177
aVradical ideas may be needed,
p178
aVand I think that we may need one or two ideas
p179
aVthat initially seem crazy
p180
aVbefore we can come to grips with consciousness
p181
aVscientifically.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, there are a few candidates
p184
aVfor what those crazy ideas might be.
p185
aVMy friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
p186
aVHis crazy idea is that there is no hard problem
p187
aVof consciousness.
p188
aVThe whole idea of the inner subjective movie
p189
aVinvolves a kind of illusion or confusion.
p190
aVActually, all we've got to do is explain
p191
aVthe objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,
p192
aVand then we've explained everything
p193
aVthat needs to be explained.
p194
aVWell I say, more power to him.
p195
aVThat's the kind of radical idea
p196
aVthat we need to explore
p197
aVif you want to have a purely reductionist
p198
aVbrain-based theory of consciousness.
p199
aVAt the same time, for me and for many other people,
p200
aVthat view is a bit too close to simply
p201
aVdenying the datum of consciousness
p202
aVto be satisfactory.
p203
aVSo I go in a different direction.
p204
aVIn the time remaining,
p205
aVI want to explore two crazy ideas
p206
aVthat I think may have some promise.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe first crazy idea
p209
aVis that consciousness is fundamental.
p210
aVPhysicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe
p211
aVas fundamental building blocks:
p212
aVspace and time and mass.
p213
aVThey postulate fundamental laws governing them,
p214
aVlike the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
p215
aVThese fundamental properties and laws
p216
aVaren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
p217
aVRather, they're taken as primitive,
p218
aVand you build up the world from there.
p219
aVNow sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
p220
aVIn the 19th century, Maxwell figured out
p221
aVthat you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena
p222
aVin terms of the existing fundamentals \u2014
p223
aVspace, time, mass, Newton's laws \u2014
p224
aVso he postulated fundamental laws
p225
aVof electromagnetism
p226
aVand postulated electric charge
p227
aVas a fundamental element
p228
aVthat those laws govern.
p229
aVI think that's the situation we're in
p230
aVwith consciousness.
p231
aVIf you can't explain consciousness
p232
aVin terms of the existing fundamentals \u2014
p233
aVspace, time, mass, charge \u2014
p234
aVthen as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.
p235
aVThe natural thing to do is to postulate
p236
aVconsciousness itself as something fundamental,
p237
aVa fundamental building block of nature.
p238
aVThis doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
p239
aVThis opens up the way for you to do science with it.
p240
aVWhat we then need is to study
p241
aVthe fundamental laws governing consciousness,
p242
aVthe laws that connect consciousness
p243
aVto other fundamentals: space, time, mass,
p244
aVphysical processes.
p245
aVPhysicists sometimes say
p246
aVthat we want fundamental laws so simple
p247
aVthat we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
p248
aVWell I think something like that is the situation
p249
aVwe're in with consciousness.
p250
aVWe want to find fundamental laws so simple
p251
aVwe could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
p252
aVWe don't know what those laws are yet,
p253
aVbut that's what we're after.
p254
aa(lp255
VThe second crazy idea
p256
aVis that consciousness might be universal.
p257
aVEvery system might have some degree
p258
aVof consciousness.
p259
aVThis view is sometimes called panpsychism:
p260
aVpan for all, psych for mind,
p261
aVevery system is conscious,
p262
aVnot just humans, dogs, mice, flies,
p263
aVbut even Rob Knight's microbes,
p264
aVelementary particles.
p265
aVEven a photon has some degree of consciousness.
p266
aVThe idea is not that photons are intelligent
p267
aVor thinking.
p268
aVIt's not that a photon
p269
aVis wracked with angst
p270
aVbecause it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.
p271
aVI never get to slow down and smell the roses."
p272
aVNo, not like that.
p273
aVBut the thought is maybe photons might have
p274
aVsome element of raw, subjective feeling,
p275
aVsome primitive precursor to consciousness.
p276
aa(lp277
VThis may sound a bit kooky to you.
p278
aVI mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
p279
aVSome motivation comes from the first crazy idea,
p280
aVthat consciousness is fundamental.
p281
aVIf it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,
p282
aVit's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,
p283
aVthe way they are.
p284
aVIt's also worth noting that although the idea
p285
aVseems counterintuitive to us,
p286
aVit's much less counterintuitive to people
p287
aVfrom different cultures,
p288
aVwhere the human mind is seen as much more
p289
aVcontinuous with nature.
p290
aa(lp291
VA deeper motivation comes from the idea that
p292
aVperhaps the most simple and powerful way
p293
aVto find fundamental laws connecting consciousness
p294
aVto physical processing
p295
aVis to link consciousness to information.
p296
aVWherever there's information processing,
p297
aVthere's consciousness.
p298
aVComplex information processing, like in a human,
p299
aVcomplex consciousness.
p300
aVSimple information processing,
p301
aVsimple consciousness.
p302
aa(lp303
VA really exciting thing is in recent years
p304
aVa neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,
p305
aVhas taken this kind of theory
p306
aVand developed it rigorously
p307
aVwith a mathematical theory.
p308
aVHe has a mathematical measure
p309
aVof information integration
p310
aVwhich he calls phi,
p311
aVmeasuring the amount of information
p312
aVintegrated in a system.
p313
aVAnd he supposes that phi goes along
p314
aVwith consciousness.
p315
aVSo in a human brain,
p316
aVincredibly large amount of information integration,
p317
aVhigh degree of phi,
p318
aVa whole lot of consciousness.
p319
aVIn a mouse, medium degree of information integration,
p320
aVstill pretty significant,
p321
aVpretty serious amount of consciousness.
p322
aVBut as you go down to worms,
p323
aVmicrobes, particles,
p324
aVthe amount of phi falls off.
p325
aVThe amount of information integration falls off,
p326
aVbut it's still non-zero.
p327
aVOn Tononi's theory,
p328
aVthere's still going to be a non-zero degree
p329
aVof consciousness.
p330
aVIn effect, he's proposing a fundamental law
p331
aVof consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
p332
aVNow, I don't know if this theory is right,
p333
aVbut it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now
p334
aVin the science of consciousness,
p335
aVand it's been used to integrate a whole range
p336
aVof scientific data,
p337
aVand it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough
p338
aVyou can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnother final motivation is that
p341
aVpanpsychism might help us to integrate
p342
aVconsciousness into the physical world.
p343
aVPhysicists and philosophers have often observed
p344
aVthat physics is curiously abstract.
p345
aVIt describes the structure of reality
p346
aVusing a bunch of equations,
p347
aVbut it doesn't tell us about the reality
p348
aVthat underlies it.
p349
aVAs Stephen Hawking puts it,
p350
aVwhat puts the fire into the equations?
p351
aVWell, on the panpsychist view,
p352
aVyou can leave the equations of physics as they are,
p353
aVbut you can take them to be describing
p354
aVthe flux of consciousness.
p355
aVThat's what physics really is ultimately doing,
p356
aVdescribing the flux of consciousness.
p357
aVOn this view, it's consciousness
p358
aVthat puts the fire into the equations.
p359
aVOn that view, consciousness doesn't dangle
p360
aVoutside the physical world
p361
aVas some kind of extra.
p362
aVIt's there right at its heart.
p363
aa(lp364
VThis view, I think, the panpsychist view,
p365
aVhas the potential to transfigure our relationship
p366
aVto nature,
p367
aVand it may have some pretty serious social
p368
aVand ethical consequences.
p369
aVSome of these may be counterintuitive.
p370
aVI used to think I shouldn't eat anything
p371
aVwhich is conscious,
p372
aVso therefore I should be vegetarian.
p373
aVNow, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,
p374
aVyou're going to go very hungry.
p375
aVSo I think when you think about it,
p376
aVthis tends to transfigure your views,
p377
aVwhereas what matters for ethical purposes
p378
aVand moral considerations,
p379
aVnot so much the fact of consciousness,
p380
aVbut the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
p381
aa(lp382
VIt's also natural to ask about consciousness
p383
aVin other systems, like computers.
p384
aVWhat about the artificially intelligent system
p385
aVin the movie "Her," Samantha?
p386
aVIs she conscious?
p387
aVWell, if you take the informational,
p388
aVpanpsychist view,
p389
aVshe certainly has complicated information processing
p390
aVand integration,
p391
aVso the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
p392
aVIf that's right, it raises pretty serious
p393
aVethical issues about both the ethics
p394
aVof developing intelligent computer systems
p395
aVand the ethics of turning them off.
p396
aa(lp397
VFinally, you might ask about the consciousness
p398
aVof whole groups,
p399
aVthe planet.
p400
aVDoes Canada have its own consciousness?
p401
aVOr at a more local level,
p402
aVdoes an integrated group
p403
aVlike the audience at a TED conference,
p404
aVare we right now having a collective TED consciousness,
p405
aVan inner movie
p406
aVfor this collective TED group
p407
aVwhich is distinct from the inner movies
p408
aVof each of our parts?
p409
aVI don't know the answer to that question,
p410
aVbut I think it's at least one
p411
aVworth taking seriously.
p412
aa(lp413
VOkay, so this panpsychist vision,
p414
aVit is a radical one,
p415
aVand I don't know that it's correct.
p416
aVI'm actually more confident about
p417
aVthe first crazy idea,
p418
aVthat consciousness is fundamental,
p419
aVthan about the second one,
p420
aVthat it's universal.
p421
aVI mean, the view raises any number of questions,
p422
aVhas any number of challenges,
p423
aVlike how do those little bits
p424
aVof consciousness add up
p425
aVto the kind of complex consciousness
p426
aVwe know and love.
p427
aVIf we can answer those questions,
p428
aVthen I think we're going to be well on our way
p429
aVto a serious theory of consciousness.
p430
aVIf not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps
p431
aVin science and philosophy.
p432
aVWe can't expect to solve it overnight.
p433
aVBut I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
p434
aVUnderstanding consciousness is a real key, I think,
p435
aVboth to understanding the universe
p436
aVand to understanding ourselves.
p437
aVIt may just take the right crazy idea.
