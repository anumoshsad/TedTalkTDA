VI'm a lifelong traveler.
p4
aVEven as a little kid,
p5
aVI was actually working out that it would be cheaper
p6
aVto go to boarding school in England
p7
aVthan just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California.
p8
aVSo, from the time I was nine years old
p9
aVI was flying alone several times a year
p10
aVover the North Pole, just to go to school.
p11
aVAnd of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly,
p12
aVso the very week after I graduated from high school,
p13
aVI got a job mopping tables
p14
aVso that I could spend every season of my 18th year
p15
aVon a different continent.
p16
aVAnd then, almost inevitably, I became a travel writer
p17
aVso my job and my joy could become one.
p18
aVAnd I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough
p19
aVto walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet
p20
aVor to wander along the seafronts in Havana
p21
aVwith music passing all around you,
p22
aVyou could bring those sounds  and the high cobalt skies
p23
aVand the flash of the blue ocean
p24
aVback to your friends at home,
p25
aVand really bring some magic
p26
aVand clarity to your own life.
p27
aVExcept, as you all know,
p28
aVone of the first things you learn when you travel
p29
aVis that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it.
p30
aVYou take an angry man to the Himalayas,
p31
aVhe just starts complaining about the food.
p32
aVAnd I found that the best way
p33
aVthat I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes
p34
aVwas, oddly,
p35
aVby going nowhere, just by sitting still.
p36
aVAnd of course sitting still is how many of us get
p37
aVwhat we most crave and need in our accelerated lives, a break.
p38
aVBut it was also the only way
p39
aVthat I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience
p40
aVand make sense of the future and the past.
p41
aVAnd so, to my great surprise,
p42
aVI found that going nowhere
p43
aVwas at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba.
p44
aVAnd by going nowhere, I mean nothing more intimidating
p45
aVthan taking a few minutes out of every day
p46
aVor a few days out of every season,
p47
aVor even, as some people do,
p48
aVa few years out of a life
p49
aVin order to sit still long enough
p50
aVto find out what moves you most,
p51
aVto recall where your truest happiness lies
p52
aVand to remember that sometimes
p53
aVmaking a living and making a life
p54
aVpoint in opposite directions.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd of course, this is what wise beings through the centuries
p57
aVfrom every tradition have been telling us.
p58
aVIt's an old idea.
p59
aVMore than 2,000 years ago,  the Stoics were reminding us
p60
aVit's not our experience that makes our lives,
p61
aVit's what we do with it.
p62
aVImagine a hurricane suddenly  sweeps through your town
p63
aVand reduces every last thing to rubble.
p64
aVOne man is traumatized for life.
p65
aVBut another, maybe even his brother, almost feels liberated,
p66
aVand decides this is a great chance to start his life anew.
p67
aVIt's exactly the same event,
p68
aVbut radically different responses.
p69
aVThere is nothing either good or bad, as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"
p70
aVbut thinking makes it so.
p71
aVAnd this has certainly been my experience as a traveler.
p72
aVTwenty-four years ago I took  the most mind-bending trip
p73
aVacross North Korea.
p74
aVBut the trip lasted a few days.
p75
aVWhat I've done with it sitting still, going back to it in my head,
p76
aVtrying to understand it, finding a place for it in my thinking,
p77
aVthat's lasted 24 years already
p78
aVand will probably last a lifetime.
p79
aVThe trip, in other words, gave me some amazing sights,
p80
aVbut it's only sitting still
p81
aVthat allows me to turn those into lasting insights.
p82
aVAnd I sometimes think that so much of our life
p83
aVtakes place inside our heads,
p84
aVin memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation,
p85
aVthat if I really want to change my life
p86
aVI might best begin by changing my mind.
p87
aVAgain, none of this is new;
p88
aVthat's why Shakespeare and the Stoics were telling us this centuries ago,
p89
aVbut Shakespeare never had to face 200 emails in a day.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aVThe Stoics, as far as I know, were not on Facebook.
p92
aVWe all know that in our on-demand lives,
p93
aVone of the things that's most on demand
p94
aVis ourselves.
p95
aVWherever we are, any time of night or day,
p96
aVour bosses, junk-mailers, our parents can get to us.
p97
aVSociologists have actually found that in recent years
p98
aVAmericans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago,
p99
aVbut we feel as if we're working more.
p100
aVWe have more and more time-saving devices,
p101
aVbut sometimes, it seems, less and less time.
p102
aVWe can more and more easily  make contact with people
p103
aVon the furthest corners of the planet,
p104
aVbut sometimes in that process
p105
aVwe lose contact with ourselves.
p106
aVAnd one of my biggest surprises  as a traveler
p107
aVhas been to find that often it's exactly the people
p108
aVwho have most enabled us to get anywhere
p109
aVwho are intent on going nowhere.
p110
aVIn other words, precisely those beings
p111
aVwho have created the technologies
p112
aVthat override so many of the limits of old,
p113
aVare the ones wisest about the need for limits,
p114
aVeven when it comes to technology.
p115
aVI once went to the Google headquarters
p116
aVand I saw all the things many of you have heard about;
p117
aVthe indoor tree houses, the trampolines,
p118
aVworkers at that time enjoying 20 percent of their paid time free
p119
aVso that they could just let their imaginations go wandering.
p120
aVBut what impressed me even more
p121
aVwas that as I was waiting for my digital I.D.,
p122
aVone Googler was telling me about the program
p123
aVthat he was about to start to teach the many, many Googlers
p124
aVwho practice yoga to become trainers in it,
p125
aVand the other Googler was telling me about the book that he was about to write
p126
aVon the inner search engine,
p127
aVand the ways in which science has empirically shown
p128
aVthat sitting still, or meditation,
p129
aVcan lead not just to better  health or to clearer thinking,
p130
aVbut even to emotional intelligence.
p131
aVI have another friend in Silicon Valley
p132
aVwho is really one  of the most eloquent spokesmen
p133
aVfor the latest technologies,
p134
aVand in fact was one of the founders of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.
p135
aVAnd Kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies
p136
aVwithout a smartphone or a laptop or a TV in his home.
p137
aVAnd like many in Silicon Valley,
p138
aVhe tries really hard to observe
p139
aVwhat they call an Internet sabbath,
p140
aVwhereby for 24 or 48 hours every week
p141
aVthey go completely offline
p142
aVin order to gather the sense of direction
p143
aVand proportion they'll need  when they go online again.
p144
aVThe one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us
p145
aVis a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology.
p146
aVAnd when you speak of the sabbath,
p147
aVlook at the Ten Commandments \u2014
p148
aVthere's only one word there for which the adjective "holy" is used,
p149
aVand that's the Sabbath.
p150
aVI pick up the Jewish holy book of the Torah \u2014
p151
aVits longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.
p152
aVAnd we all know that it's really one of our greatest luxuries,
p153
aVthe empty space.
p154
aVIn many a piece of music,  it's the pause or the rest
p155
aVthat gives the piece its beauty and its shape.
p156
aVAnd I know I as a writer
p157
aVwill often try to include a lot of empty space on the page
p158
aVso that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences
p159
aVand so that her imagination has room to breathe.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, in the physical domain,  of course, many people,
p162
aVif they have the resources,
p163
aVwill try to get a place in the country, a second home.
p164
aVI've never begun to have those resources,
p165
aVbut I sometimes remember that any time I want,
p166
aVI can get a second home in time, if not in space,
p167
aVjust by taking a day off.
p168
aVAnd it's never easy because, of course,  whenever I do I spend much of it
p169
aVworried about all the extra stuff
p170
aVthat's going to crash down on me the following day.
p171
aVI sometimes think I'd rather give up meat or sex or wine
p172
aVthan the chance to check on my emails.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVAnd every season I do try to take three days off on retreat
p175
aVbut a part of me still feels guilty to be leaving my poor wife behind
p176
aVand to be ignoring all those seemingly urgent emails
p177
aVfrom my bosses
p178
aVand maybe to be missing a friend's birthday party.
p179
aVBut as soon as I get to a place of real quiet,
p180
aVI realize that it's only by going there
p181
aVthat I'll have anything fresh or creative or joyful to share
p182
aVwith my wife or bosses or friends.
p183
aVOtherwise, really,
p184
aVI'm just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness,
p185
aVwhich is no blessing at all.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd so when I was 29,
p188
aVI decided to remake my entire life
p189
aVin the light of going nowhere.
p190
aVOne evening I was coming back from the office,
p191
aVit was after midnight, I was in a taxi driving through Times Square,
p192
aVand I suddenly realized that I was racing around so much
p193
aVI could never catch up with my life.
p194
aVAnd my life then, as it happened,
p195
aVwas pretty much the one I might have dreamed of as a little boy.
p196
aVI had really interesting friends and colleagues,
p197
aVI had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street.
p198
aVI had, to me, a fascinating job  writing about world affairs,
p199
aVbut I could never separate myself enough from them
p200
aVto hear myself think \u2014
p201
aVor really, to understand if I was truly happy.
p202
aVAnd so, I abandoned my dream life
p203
aVfor a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan,
p204
aVwhich was the place that had long exerted a strong,
p205
aVreally mysterious gravitational pull on me.
p206
aVEven as a child
p207
aVI would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;
p208
aVI knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.
p209
aVBut it's also, as you all know,
p210
aVa beautiful city encircled by hills,
p211
aVfilled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines,
p212
aVwhere people have been sitting still for 800 years or more.
p213
aVAnd quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am
p214
aVwith my wife, formerly our kids,
p215
aVin a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere
p216
aVwhere we have no bicycle, no car,
p217
aVno TV I can understand,
p218
aVand I still have to support my loved ones
p219
aVas a travel writer and a journalist,
p220
aVso clearly this is not ideal for job advancement
p221
aVor for cultural excitement
p222
aVor for social diversion.
p223
aVBut I realized that it gives me what I prize most,
p224
aVwhich is days
p225
aVand hours.
p226
aVI have never once had to use a cell phone there.
p227
aVI almost never have to look at the time,
p228
aVand every morning when I wake up,
p229
aVreally the day stretches in front of me
p230
aVlike an open meadow.
p231
aVAnd when life throws up one of its nasty surprises,
p232
aVas it will, more than once,
p233
aVwhen a doctor comes into my room
p234
aVwearing a grave expression,
p235
aVor a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway,
p236
aVI know, in my bones,
p237
aVthat it's the time I've spent going nowhere
p238
aVthat is going to sustain me much more
p239
aVthan all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
p240
aa(lp241
VI'll always be a traveler \u2014
p242
aVmy livelihood depends on it \u2014
p243
aVbut one of the beauties of travel
p244
aVis that it allows you to bring stillness
p245
aVinto the motion and the commotion of the world.
p246
aVI once got on a plane in Frankfurt, Germany,
p247
aVand a young German woman  came down and sat next to me
p248
aVand engaged me in a very friendly conversation
p249
aVfor about 30 minutes,
p250
aVand then she just turned around
p251
aVand sat still for 12 hours.
p252
aVShe didn't once turn on her video monitor,
p253
aVshe never pulled out a book, she didn't even go to sleep,
p254
aVshe just sat still,
p255
aVand something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me.
p256
aVI've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days
p257
aVto try to open up a space inside their lives.
p258
aVSome people go to black-hole resorts
p259
aVwhere they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night
p260
aVin order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop
p261
aVto the front desk on arrival.
p262
aVSome people I know, just before they go to sleep,
p263
aVinstead of scrolling through their messages
p264
aVor checking out YouTube,
p265
aVjust turn out the lights and listen to some music,
p266
aVand notice that they sleep much better
p267
aVand wake up much refreshed.
p268
aVI was once fortunate enough
p269
aVto drive into the high, dark mountains behind Los Angeles,
p270
aVwhere the great poet and singer
p271
aVand international heartthrob Leonard Cohen
p272
aVwas living and working for many years as a full-time monk
p273
aVin the Mount Baldy Zen Center.
p274
aVAnd I wasn't entirely surprised
p275
aVwhen the record that he released at the age of 77,
p276
aVto which he gave the deliberately  unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"
p277
aVwent to number one in the charts  in 17 nations in the world,
p278
aVhit the top five in nine others.
p279
aVSomething in us, I think, is crying out
p280
aVfor the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that.
p281
aVwho take the time and trouble to sit still.
p282
aVAnd I think many of us have the sensation,
p283
aVI certainly do,
p284
aVthat we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen,
p285
aVand it's noisy and it's crowded
p286
aVand it's changing with every second,
p287
aVand that screen is our lives.
p288
aVAnd it's only by stepping back, and then further back,
p289
aVand holding still,
p290
aVthat we can begin to see what the canvas means
p291
aVand to catch the larger picture.
p292
aVAnd a few people do that for us by going nowhere.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, in an age of acceleration,
p295
aVnothing can be more exhilarating than going slow.
p296
aVAnd in an age of distraction,
p297
aVnothing is so luxurious as paying attention.
p298
aVAnd in an age of constant movement,
p299
aVnothing is so urgent as sitting still.
p300
aVSo you can go on your next vacation
p301
aVto Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;
p302
aVI bet you'll have a wonderful time.
p303
aVBut, if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope,
p304
aVin love with the world,
p305
aVI think you might want to try considering going nowhere.
p306
aVThank you.
