VI write fiction sci-fi thrillers,
p4
aVso if I say "killer robots,"
p5
aVyou'd probably think something like this.
p6
aVBut I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.
p7
aVI'm here to talk about very real killer robots,
p8
aVautonomous combat drones.
p9
aa(lp10
VNow, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,
p11
aVwhich have a human making targeting decisions.
p12
aVI'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons
p13
aVthat make lethal decisions about human beings
p14
aVall on their own.
p15
aVThere's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, lethally autonomous killer robots
p18
aVwould take many forms \u2014 flying, driving,
p19
aVor just lying in wait.
p20
aVAnd actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.
p21
aVThese are two automatic sniper stations
p22
aVcurrently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.
p23
aVBoth of these machines are capable of automatically
p24
aVidentifying a human target and firing on it,
p25
aVthe one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.
p26
aVNow, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop
p27
aVto make that lethal firing decision,
p28
aVbut it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.
p29
aVAnd it's that choice that I want to focus on,
p30
aVbecause as we migrate lethal decision-making
p31
aVfrom humans to software,
p32
aVwe risk not only taking the humanity out of war,
p33
aVbut also changing our social landscape entirely,
p34
aVfar from the battlefield.
p35
aVThat's because the way humans resolve conflict
p36
aVshapes our social landscape.
p37
aVAnd this has always been the case, throughout history.
p38
aa(lp39
VFor example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems
p40
aVin 1400 A.D.
p41
aVNow they were both very expensive to build and maintain,
p42
aVbut with these you could dominate the populace,
p43
aVand the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.
p44
aVPower was focused at the very top.
p45
aVAnd what changed? Technological innovation.
p46
aVGunpowder, cannon.
p47
aVAnd pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,
p48
aVand it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield
p49
aVversus how many people you brought to the battlefield.
p50
aVAnd as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose
p51
aVas a political and logistical requirement of defense.
p52
aVAnd as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,
p53
aVthey began to share power.
p54
aVRepresentative government began to form.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo again, the tools we use to resolve conflict
p57
aVshape our social landscape.
p58
aVAutonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,
p59
aVexcept that, by requiring very few people to go to war,
p60
aVthey risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,
p61
aVpossibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow, I think, knowing this,
p64
aVwe can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,
p65
aVto do what humans do best, which is adapt.
p66
aVBut time is a factor.
p67
aVSeventy nations are developing remotely-piloted
p68
aVcombat drones of their own,
p69
aVand as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones
p70
aVare the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.
p71
aVThat's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,
p72
aVthere are three powerful factors pushing decision-making
p73
aVaway from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.
p76
aVFor example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced
p77
aVa grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.
p78
aVBy 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,
p79
aVoutstripping human ability to review it all,
p80
aVbut even that number is about to go up drastically.
p81
aVThe Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs
p82
aVwill put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes
p83
aVon each drone platform,
p84
aVand this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.
p85
aVAnd that means visual intelligence software will need
p86
aVto scan it for items of interest.
p87
aVAnd that means very soon
p88
aVdrones will tell humans what to look at,
p89
aVnot the other way around.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut there's a second powerful incentive pushing
p92
aVdecision-making away from humans and onto machines,
p93
aVand that's electromagnetic jamming,
p94
aVsevering the connection between the drone
p95
aVand its operator.
p96
aVNow we saw an example of this in 2011
p97
aVwhen an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone
p98
aVgot a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,
p99
aVbut any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,
p100
aVand that means drones
p101
aVwill have to shoulder more decision-making.
p102
aVThey'll know their mission objective,
p103
aVand they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.
p104
aVThey'll ignore external radio signals
p105
aVand send very few of their own.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhich brings us to, really, the third
p108
aVand most powerful incentive pushing decision-making
p109
aVaway from humans and onto weapons:
p110
aVplausible deniability.
p111
aVNow we live in a global economy.
p112
aVHigh-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.
p113
aVCyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs
p114
aVto parts unknown,
p115
aVand in that environment, it is very likely
p116
aVthat a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,
p117
aVproliferate in the gray market.
p118
aVAnd in that situation, sifting through the wreckage
p119
aVof a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say
p120
aVwho sent that weapon.
p121
aa(lp122
VThis raises the very real possibility
p123
aVof anonymous war.
p124
aVThis could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,
p125
aVmake it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower
p126
aVagainst an attacker, and that could shift the balance
p127
aVin the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.
p128
aVIt could make military action a viable option
p129
aVnot just for small nations,
p130
aVbut criminal organizations, private enterprise,
p131
aVeven powerful individuals.
p132
aVIt could create a landscape of rival warlords
p133
aVundermining rule of law and civil society.
p134
aVNow if responsibility and transparency
p135
aVare two of the cornerstones of representative government,
p136
aVautonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow you might be thinking that
p139
aVcitizens of high-tech nations
p140
aVwould have the advantage in any robotic war,
p141
aVthat citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,
p142
aVparticularly against developing nations.
p143
aVBut I think the truth is the exact opposite.
p144
aVI think citizens of high-tech societies
p145
aVare more vulnerable to robotic weapons,
p146
aVand the reason can be summed up in one word: data.
p147
aVData powers high-tech societies.
p148
aVCell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,
p149
aVsocial media, email, text, financial transaction data,
p150
aVtransportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data
p151
aVon the movements and social interactions of people.
p152
aVIn short, we are more visible to machines
p153
aVthan any people in history,
p154
aVand this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.
p155
aa(lp156
VWhat you're looking at here
p157
aVis a link analysis map of a social group.
p158
aVLines indicate social connectedness between individuals.
p159
aVAnd these types of maps can be automatically generated
p160
aVbased on the data trail modern people leave behind.
p161
aVNow it's typically used to market goods and services
p162
aVto targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,
p163
aVbecause targeting is used in another context.
p164
aVNotice that certain individuals are highlighted.
p165
aVThese are the hubs of social networks.
p166
aVThese are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,
p167
aVand these people also can be automatically identified
p168
aVfrom their communication patterns.
p169
aVNow, if you're a marketer, you might then target them
p170
aVwith product samples, try to spread your brand
p171
aVthrough their social group.
p172
aVBut if you're a repressive government
p173
aVsearching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,
p174
aVeliminate them, disrupt their social group,
p175
aVand those who remain behind lose social cohesion
p176
aVand organization.
p177
aVNow in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,
p178
aVborders would offer very little protection
p179
aVto critics of distant governments
p180
aVor trans-national criminal organizations.
p181
aVPopular movements agitating for change
p182
aVcould be detected early and their leaders eliminated
p183
aVbefore their ideas achieve critical mass.
p184
aVAnd ideas achieving critical mass
p185
aVis what political activism in popular government is all about.
p186
aVAnonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action
p187
aVan easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.
p188
aVAnd this would put a chill on free speech
p189
aVand popular political action, the very heart of democracy.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd this is why we need an international treaty
p192
aVon robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban
p193
aVon the development and deployment of killer robots.
p194
aVNow we already have international treaties
p195
aVon nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,
p196
aVthese have largely worked.
p197
aVBut robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,
p198
aVbecause they will almost certainly be used,
p199
aVand they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.
p200
aa(lp201
VNow in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense
p202
aVissued a directive requiring
p203
aVa human being be present in all lethal decisions.
p204
aVThis temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,
p205
aVbut that directive needs to be made permanent.
p206
aVAnd it could set the stage for global action.
p207
aVBecause we need an international legal framework
p208
aVfor robotic weapons.
p209
aVAnd we need it now, before there's a devastating attack
p210
aVor a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world
p211
aVto rush to adopt these weapons
p212
aVbefore thinking through the consequences.
p213
aVAutonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power
p214
aVin too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons
p217
aVof great uses for unarmed civilian drones:
p218
aVenvironmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.
p219
aVIf we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,
p220
aVhow do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones
p221
aVand vehicles while still protecting ourselves
p222
aVagainst illegal robotic weapons?
p223
aa(lp224
VI think the secret will be transparency.
p225
aVNo robot should have an expectation of privacy
p226
aVin a public place.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VEach robot and drone should have
p231
aVa cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory
p232
aVthat can be used to track its movement through public spaces.
p233
aVWe have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.
p234
aVThis is no different.
p235
aVAnd every citizen should be able to download an app
p236
aVthat shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles
p237
aVmoving through public spaces around them,
p238
aVboth right now and historically.
p239
aVAnd civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones
p240
aVto detect rogue drones,
p241
aVand instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,
p242
aVthey should notify humans to their presence.
p243
aVAnd in certain very high-security areas,
p244
aVperhaps civic drones would snare them
p245
aVand drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut notice, this is more an immune system
p248
aVthan a weapons system.
p249
aVIt would allow us to avail ourselves of the use
p250
aVof autonomous vehicles and drones
p251
aVwhile still preserving our open, civil society.
p252
aa(lp253
VWe must ban the deployment and development
p254
aVof killer robots.
p255
aVLet's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.
p256
aVAutocratic governments and criminal organizations
p257
aVundoubtedly will, but let's not join them.
p258
aVAutonomous robotic weapons
p259
aVwould concentrate too much power
p260
aVin too few unseen hands,
p261
aVand that would be corrosive to representative government.
p262
aVLet's make sure, for democracies at least,
p263
aVkiller robots remain fiction.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
