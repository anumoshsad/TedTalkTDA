VHi.
p4
aVLet me ask the audience a question:
p5
aVDid you ever lie as a child?
p6
aVIf you did, could you please raise your hand?
p7
aVWow! This is the most honest group of people I've ever met.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VSo for the last 20 years,
p12
aVI've been studying how children learn to tell lies.
p13
aVAnd today, I'm going to share with you
p14
aVsome of the discoveries we have made.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut to begin, I'm going to tell you a story from Mr. Richard Messina,
p17
aVwho is my friend and an elementary school principal.
p18
aVHe got a phone call one day.
p19
aVThe caller says,
p20
aV"Mr. Messina, my son Johnny will not come to school today
p21
aVbecause he's sick."
p22
aa(lp23
VMr. Messina asks,
p24
aV"Who am I speaking to, please?"
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd the caller says,
p27
aV"I am my father."
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo this story \u2014
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
Vsums up very nicely three common beliefs we have
p36
aVabout children and lying.
p37
aVOne, children only come to tell lies
p38
aVafter entering elementary school.
p39
aVTwo, children are poor liars.
p40
aVWe adults can easily detect their lies.
p41
aVAnd three, if children lie at a very young age,
p42
aVthere must be some character flaws with them,
p43
aVand they are going to become pathological liars for life.
p44
aVWell, it turns out
p45
aVall of the three beliefs are wrong.
p46
aa(lp47
VWe have been playing guessing games
p48
aVwith children all over the world.
p49
aVHere is an example.
p50
aVSo in this game, we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards.
p51
aVAnd we tell them if they win the game,
p52
aVthey are going to get a big prize.
p53
aVBut in the middle of the game,
p54
aVwe make an excuse and leave the room.
p55
aVAnd before we leave the room,
p56
aVwe tell them not to peek at the cards.
p57
aVOf course,
p58
aVwe have hidden cameras in the room
p59
aVto watch their every move.
p60
aVBecause the desire to win the game is so strong,
p61
aVmore than 90 percent of children will peek
p62
aVas soon as we leave the room.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VThe crucial question is:
p67
aVWhen we return and ask the children
p68
aVwhether or not they have peeked,
p69
aVwill the children who peeked confess
p70
aVor lie about their transgression?
p71
aa(lp72
VWe found that regardless of gender, country, religion,
p73
aVat two years of age,
p74
aV30 percent lie,
p75
aV70 percent tell the truth about their transgression.
p76
aVAt three years of age,
p77
aV50 percent lie and 50 percent tell the truth.
p78
aVAt four years of age,
p79
aVmore than 80 percent lie.
p80
aVAnd after four years of age,
p81
aVmost children lie.
p82
aVSo as you can see,
p83
aVlying is really a typical part of development.
p84
aVAnd some children begin to tell lies
p85
aVas young as two years of age.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo now, let's take a closer look at the younger children.
p88
aVWhy do some but not all young children lie?
p89
aVIn cooking, you need good ingredients
p90
aVto cook good food.
p91
aVAnd good lying requires two key ingredients.
p92
aVThe first key ingredient is theory of mind,
p93
aVor the mind-reading ability.
p94
aVMind reading is the ability to know
p95
aVthat different people have different knowledge about the situation
p96
aVand the ability to differentiate between what I know
p97
aVand what you know.
p98
aVMind reading is important for lying
p99
aVbecause the basis of lying is that I know
p100
aVyou don't know
p101
aVwhat I know.
p102
aVTherefore, I can lie to you.
p103
aa(lp104
VThe second key ingredient for good lying is self-control.
p105
aVIt is the ability to control your speech, your facial expression
p106
aVand your body language,
p107
aVso that you can tell a convincing lie.
p108
aVAnd we found that those young children
p109
aVwho have more advanced mind-reading and self-control abilities
p110
aVtell lies earlier
p111
aVand are more sophisticated liars.
p112
aVAs it turns out, these two abilities are also essential for all of us
p113
aVto function well in our society.
p114
aVIn fact, deficits in mind-reading and self-control abilities
p115
aVare associated with serious developmental problems,
p116
aVsuch as ADHD and autism.
p117
aVSo if you discover your two-year-old is telling his or her first lie,
p118
aVinstead of being alarmed,
p119
aVyou should celebrate \u2014
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
Vbecause it signals that your child has arrived at a new milestone
p124
aVof typical development.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, are children poor liars?
p127
aVDo you think you can easily detect their lies?
p128
aVWould you like to give it a try?
p129
aVYes? OK.
p130
aVSo I'm going to show you two videos.
p131
aVIn the videos,
p132
aVthe children are going to respond to a researcher's question,
p133
aV"Did you peek?"
p134
aVSo try to tell me
p135
aVwhich child is lying
p136
aVand which child is telling the truth.
p137
aVHere's child number one.
p138
aVAre you ready?
p139
aa(lp140
V(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
p141
aa(lp142
VKang Lee: And this is child number two.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
p145
aa(lp146
VKL: OK, if you think child number one is lying,
p147
aVplease raise your hand.
p148
aVAnd if you think child number two is lying, please raise your hand.
p149
aVOK, so as a matter of fact,
p150
aVchild number one is telling the truth,
p151
aVchild number two is lying.
p152
aVLooks like many of you are terrible detectors of children's lies.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, we have played similar kinds of games
p157
aVwith many, many adults from all walks of life.
p158
aVAnd we show them many videos.
p159
aVIn half of the videos, the children lied.
p160
aVIn the other half of the videos, the children told the truth.
p161
aVAnd let's find out how these adults performed.
p162
aVBecause there are as many liars as truth tellers,
p163
aVif you guess randomly,
p164
aVthere's a 50 percent chance you're going to get it right.
p165
aVSo if your accuracy is around 50 percent,
p166
aVit means you are a terrible detector of children's lies.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo let's start with undergrads and law school students,
p169
aVwho typically have limited experience with children.
p170
aVNo, they cannot detect children's lies.
p171
aVTheir performance is around chance.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow how about social workers and child-protection lawyers,
p174
aVwho work with children on a daily basis?
p175
aVCan they detect children's lies?
p176
aVNo, they cannot.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VWhat about judges,
p181
aVcustoms officers
p182
aVand police officers,
p183
aVwho deal with liars on a daily basis?
p184
aVCan they detect children's lies?
p185
aVNo, they cannot.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhat about parents?
p188
aVCan parents detect other children's lies?
p189
aVNo, they cannot.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhat about, can parents detect their own children's lies?
p192
aVNo, they cannot.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p195
aa(lp196
VSo now you may ask
p197
aVwhy children's lies are so difficult to detect.
p198
aVLet me illustrate this with my own son, Nathan.
p199
aVThis is his facial expression
p200
aVwhen he lies.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo when children lie,
p205
aVtheir facial expression is typically neutral.
p206
aVHowever, behind this neutral expression,
p207
aVthe child is actually experiencing a lot of emotions,
p208
aVsuch as fear, guilt, shame
p209
aVand maybe a little bit of liar's delight.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VUnfortunately, such emotions are either fleeting or hidden.
p214
aVTherefore, it's mostly invisible to us.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo in the last five years,
p217
aVwe have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions.
p218
aVThen we made a discovery.
p219
aa(lp220
VWe know that underneath our facial skin,
p221
aVthere's a rich network of blood vessels.
p222
aVWhen we experience different emotions,
p223
aVour facial blood flow changes subtly.
p224
aVAnd these changes are regulated by the autonomic system
p225
aVthat is beyond our conscious control.
p226
aVBy looking at facial blood flow changes,
p227
aVwe can reveal people's hidden emotions.
p228
aVUnfortunately, such emotion-related facial blood flow changes
p229
aVare too subtle to detect by our naked eye.
p230
aVSo to help us reveal people's facial emotions,
p231
aVwe have developed a new imaging technology
p232
aVwe call "transdermal optical imaging."
p233
aa(lp234
VTo do so, we use a regular video camera to record people
p235
aVwhen they experience various hidden emotions.
p236
aVAnd then, using our image processing technology,
p237
aVwe can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes.
p238
aVBy looking at transdermal video images,
p239
aVnow we can easily see
p240
aVfacial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions.
p241
aVAnd using this technology,
p242
aVwe can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying,
p243
aVand therefore detect people's lies.
p244
aVWe can do so noninvasively,
p245
aVremotely, inexpensively,
p246
aVwith an accuracy at about 85 percent,
p247
aVwhich is far better than chance level.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd in addition, we discovered a Pinocchio effect.
p250
aVNo, not this Pinocchio effect.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VThis is the real Pinocchio effect.
p255
aVWhen people lie,
p256
aVthe facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases,
p257
aVand the facial blood flow on the nose increases.
p258
aa(lp259
VOf course, lying is not the only situation
p260
aVthat will evoke our hidden emotions.
p261
aVSo then we asked ourselves,
p262
aVin addition to detecting lies,
p263
aVhow can our technology be used?
p264
aVOne application is in education.
p265
aVFor example, using this technology, we can help this mathematics teacher
p266
aVto identify the student in his classroom
p267
aVwho may experience high anxiety about the topic he's teaching
p268
aVso that he can help him.
p269
aVAnd also we can use this in health care.
p270
aVFor example, every day I Skype my parents,
p271
aVwho live thousands of miles away.
p272
aVAnd using this technology,
p273
aVI can not only find out what's going on in their lives
p274
aVbut also simultaneously monitor their heart rate, their stress level,
p275
aVtheir mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain.
p276
aVAnd perhaps in the future,
p277
aVtheir risks for heart attack or hypertension.
p278
aVAnd you may ask:
p279
aVCan we use this also to reveal politicians' emotions?
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VFor example, during a debate.
p284
aVWell, the answer is yes.
p285
aVUsing TV footage,
p286
aVwe could detect the politicians' heart rate,
p287
aVmood and stress,
p288
aVand perhaps in the future, whether or not they are lying to us.
p289
aVWe can also use this in marketing research,
p290
aVfor example, to find out
p291
aVwhether or not people like certain consumer products.
p292
aVWe can even use it in dating.
p293
aVSo for example,
p294
aVif your date is smiling at you,
p295
aVthis technology can help you to determine
p296
aVwhether she actually likes you
p297
aVor she is just trying to be nice to you.
p298
aVAnd in this case,
p299
aVshe is just trying to be nice to you.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VSo transdermal optical imaging technology
p304
aVis at a very early stage of development.
p305
aVMany new applications will come about that we don't know today.
p306
aVHowever, one thing I know for sure
p307
aVis that lying will never be the same again.
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you very much.
p310
aa(lp311
VXiè xie.
