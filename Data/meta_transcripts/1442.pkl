VI'm a very lucky person.
p4
aVI've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth
p5
aVand the people and creatures that live on it.
p6
aVAnd my passion was inspired at the age of seven,
p7
aVwhen my parents first took me to Morocco,
p8
aVat the edge of the Sahara Desert.
p9
aVNow imagine a little Brit
p10
aVsomewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.
p11
aVWhat an amazing experience.
p12
aVAnd it made me want to explore more.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo as a filmmaker,
p15
aVI've been from one end of the Earth to the other
p16
aVtrying to get the perfect shot
p17
aVand to capture animal behavior never seen before.
p18
aVAnd what's more, I'm really lucky,
p19
aVbecause I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.
p20
aVNow the idea of having new perspectives of our planet
p21
aVand actually being able to get that message out
p22
aVgets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.
p23
aa(lp24
VYou might think that it's quite hard
p25
aVto find new stories and new subjects,
p26
aVbut new technology is changing the way we can film.
p27
aVIt's enabling us to get fresh, new images
p28
aVand tell brand new stories.
p29
aVIn Nature's Great Events,
p30
aVa series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,
p31
aVwe wanted to do just that.
p32
aa(lp33
VImages of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.
p34
aVYou see them all the time, you think.
p35
aVBut there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see
p36
aVand had never been filmed.
p37
aVSo what we did, we went to Alaska,
p38
aVwhich is where the grizzlies rely
p39
aVon really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes
p40
aVfor their denning.
p41
aVAnd the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,
p44
aVthousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.
p45
aVThere is nothing to eat up here,
p46
aVbut the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
p47
aVLots of snow in which to dig a den.
p48
aVTo find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,
p49
aVwhere the snow will already be melting.
p50
aVBut getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
p51
aVThese mountains are dangerous places,
p52
aVbut ultimately the fate of these bear families,
p53
aVand indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,
p54
aVdepends on the salmon.
p55
aa(lp56
VKB: I love that shot.
p57
aVI always get goosebumps every time I see it.
p58
aVThat was filmed from a helicopter
p59
aVusing a gyro-stabilized camera.
p60
aVAnd it's a wonderful bit of gear,
p61
aVbecause it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.
p62
aVBut technology alone isn't enough.
p63
aVTo really get the money shots,
p64
aVit's down to being in the right place at the right time.
p65
aVAnd that sequence was especially difficult.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe first year we got nothing.
p68
aVWe had to go back the following year,
p69
aVall the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.
p70
aVAnd we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.
p71
aVAnd eventually we got lucky.
p72
aVThe cloud lifted, the wind was still,
p73
aVand even the bear showed up.
p74
aVAnd we managed to get that magic moment.
p75
aa(lp76
VFor a filmmaker,
p77
aVnew technology is an amazing tool,
p78
aVbut the other thing that really, really excites me
p79
aVis when new species are discovered.
p80
aVNow, when I heard about one animal,
p81
aVI knew we had to get it for my next series,
p82
aVUntamed Americas, for National Geographic.
p83
aVIn 2005, a new species of bat was discovered
p84
aVin the cloud forests of Ecuador.
p85
aVAnd what was amazing about that discovery
p86
aVis that it also solved the mystery
p87
aVof what pollinated a unique flower.
p88
aVIt depends solely on the bat.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, the series hasn't even aired yet,
p91
aVso you're the very first to see this.
p92
aVSee what you think.
p93
aV(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.
p94
aVA pool of delicious nectar
p95
aVlies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.
p96
aVBut how to reach it?
p97
aVNecessity is the mother of evolution.
p98
aV(Music)
p99
aVThis two-and-a-half-inch bat
p100
aVhas a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,
p101
aVthe longest relative to body length
p102
aVof any mammal in the world.
p103
aVIf human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
p104
aV(Applause)
p105
aVKB: What a tongue.
p106
aVWe filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower
p107
aVand using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.
p108
aVSo imagine how quick that thing is in real life.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"
p111
aVAnd the truth is I just don't have one.
p112
aVThere are so many wonderful places.
p113
aVBut some locations draw you back time and time again.
p114
aVAnd one remote location \u2014
p115
aVI first went there as a backpacker;
p116
aVI've been back several times for filming,
p117
aVmost recently for Untamed Americas \u2014
p118
aVit's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,
p119
aVand it's the most otherworldly place I know.
p120
aVBut at 15,000 feet, it's tough.
p121
aVIt's freezing cold,
p122
aVand that thin air really gets you.
p123
aVSometimes it's hard to breathe,
p124
aVespecially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.
p125
aVAnd that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.
p126
aVBut the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere
p127
aVis that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens
p128
aVwith amazing clarity.
p129
aVHave a look.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,
p132
aVbetween Chile and Bolivia,
p133
aVthe Andes completely change.
p134
aVIt's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" \u2014
p135
aVa place of extremes
p136
aVand extreme contrasts.
p137
aVWhere deserts freeze
p138
aVand waters boil.
p139
aVMore like Mars than Earth,
p140
aVit seems just as hostile to life.
p141
aVThe stars themselves \u2014
p142
aVat 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air
p143
aVmakes for perfect stargazing.
p144
aVSome of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
p145
aVBut just looking up with the naked eye,
p146
aVyou really don't need one.
