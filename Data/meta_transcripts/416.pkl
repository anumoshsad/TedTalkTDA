VWhat I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,
p4
aVis just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,
p5
aVand then nod to the person on your left.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVNow, chances are that over the last winter,
p8
aVif you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people
p9
aVyou just nodded at would have died.
p10
aVNow, that's an awful lot of bees.
p11
aVAnd this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent
p12
aVof the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.
p15
aVAnd most of those losses are because of things we know.
p16
aVWe know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced
p17
aVand caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,
p18
aVwhich I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.
p19
aVAnd here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.
p20
aVAnd below, you can see all these out yards,
p21
aVor temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,
p22
aVand then they're shipped out to the almonds.
p23
aVAnd one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months
p24
aVafter I was here, described this not as beehives
p25
aVbut as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences
p28
aVto say that we have been trying to figure out
p29
aVwhat the cause of this is.
p30
aVAnd what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
p31
aVAnd this flu has wiped through the population of bees.
p32
aVIn some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,
p33
aVthis flu was caused by a new virus to us,
p34
aVor newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.
p35
aVIt was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,
p36
aVand he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,
p37
aVof course, there's the implication.
p38
aVBut we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.
p39
aVIt's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses
p40
aVor other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,
p41
aVand the question that keeps us up at night,
p42
aVis why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,
p43
aVand why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?
p44
aVAnd we don't have the answer to that yet,
p45
aVand we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.
p46
aVWe think perhaps it's a combination of factors.
p47
aVWe know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team
p48
aVthat, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides
p49
aVin the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives
p50
aVhave the most pesticides. And so we discover all these
p51
aVvery strange things that we can't begin to understand.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.
p54
aVNow of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,
p55
aVbeekeepers can replace them very quickly.
p56
aVAnd that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.
p57
aVIf we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,
p58
aVthe National Guard would be out.
p59
aVBut what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,
p60
aVthey can split that colony in two.
p61
aVAnd then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.
p62
aVIt comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,
p63
aVand you can introduce that queen.
p64
aVAnd in fact, America was the first country
p65
aVthat ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,
p66
aVit's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail
p67
aVin order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.
p68
aVIf you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,
p69
aVa three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,
p70
aVthe Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,
p71
aVyou know, your three-pound packages of bees.
p72
aVAnd you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
p73
aVSo it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,
p74
aVand so they've been able to cover those losses.
p75
aVSo even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,
p76
aVthe same number of colonies have existed in the country,
p77
aVat about 2.4 million colonies.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, those losses are tragic on many fronts,
p80
aVand one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.
p81
aVAnd it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,
p82
aVbecause beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.
p83
aVIf this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone
p84
aVfrom the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,
p85
aVto the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco
p86
aVbackyard pig farmer.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVAnd you get all of these people in the same room,
p89
aVand they're all engaged and they're getting along,
p90
aVand they're all there because of the passion for bees.
p91
aVNow, there's another part of that community
p92
aVwhich are the commercial beekeepers,
p93
aVthe ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.
p94
aVAnd these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,
p95
aVintuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.
p96
aVThey're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
p97
aa(lp98
VI had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.
p99
aVAnd Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.
p100
aVI mean, there may be 100 explanations
p101
aVfor why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,
p102
aVbut there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.
p103
aVBut you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,
p104
aVand he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.
p105
aVNo formal education, but very knowledgeable.
p106
aVWe needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,
p107
aVhe was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen
p108
aVfrom cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,
p109
aVright in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.
p112
aVHe's the one who first identified this condition
p113
aVand raised the alarm bells.
p114
aVAnd he has a history of these trucks,
p115
aVand he's moved these bees up and down the coast.
p116
aVAnd a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,
p117
aVand that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.
p118
aVThe ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,
p119
aVso this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.
p120
aVAnd one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder
p121
aVis the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.
p122
aVAnd you can do that one year in a row,
p123
aVyou may be able to do it two years in a row.
p124
aVBut if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,
p125
aVyou can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried
p126
aVabout losing this segment of our industry.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd that's important for many fronts,
p129
aVand one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.
p130
aVAnd these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.
p131
aVYou know, they pick up their hives;
p132
aVthey move their families once or twice in a year.
p133
aVAnd if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,
p134
aVthat's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.
p135
aVAnd then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,
p136
aVand that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.
p137
aVAnd if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café
p138
aVat 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.
p139
aVAnd that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees
p140
aVinto the almond groves.
p141
aVThey all have their breakfast
p142
aVand complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,
p143
aVand I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,
p144
aVbecause that's quite essential American experience.
p145
aVAnd we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,
p146
aVfather to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.
p147
aVAnd they're not people who like to ask for help,
p148
aValthough they are the most helpful people ever.
p149
aVIf there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,
p150
aVeveryone pitches in and gives 20 hives
p151
aVto help him replace those lost colonies.
p152
aVAnd so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,
p153
aVhistoric and exciting community to be involved with.
p154
aa(lp155
VOf course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.
p156
aVAnd although I highly encourage you, all use honey.
p157
aVI mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,
p158
aVand you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.
p159
aVBut we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat
p160
aVis directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.
p161
aVNow, I want to just illustrate that in the fact
p162
aVthat if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning \u2014
p163
aVa little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,
p164
aVI should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,
p165
aVjam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee \u2014
p166
aVand had we taken out all those ingredients,
p167
aV\u2014 except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola \u2014
p168
aVif we had taken out all those ingredients
p169
aVthe bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,
p170
aVwe wouldn't have much on our plate.
p171
aVSo if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,
p172
aVbut clearly our diet would be diminished.
p173
aVIt's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,
p174
aVand for flowers bees are the messengers of love.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd that's a really great expression, because really,
p177
aVbees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know \u2014
p178
aVthey get paid for their services.
p179
aVThey get paid by pollen and nectar,
p180
aVto move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.
p181
aVAnd there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't \u2014
p182
aVthe pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.
p183
aVSo in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples
p184
aVof one variety, and then you have another apple tree
p185
aVthat's a different type of pollen.
p186
aVAnd bees are very faithful.
p187
aVWhen they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,
p188
aVthey stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.
p189
aVAnd of course, they're made to carry this pollen.
p190
aVThey build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them
p191
aVand helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.
p192
aa(lp193
VHowever, honeybees are a minority.
p194
aVHoneybees are not native to America; they were introduced
p195
aVwith the colonialists.
p196
aVAnd there are actually more species of bees
p197
aVthan there are mammals and birds combined.
p198
aVIn Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,
p199
aVand very intensely in the last three years.
p200
aVWe have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.
p201
aVThirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.
p202
aVNow, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,
p203
aVbut it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong
p204
aVwith the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.
p205
aa(lp206
VWe have bumblebees on the top.
p207
aVAnd bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,
p208
aVbecause only the queen is, over winter.
p209
aVWe also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.
p210
aVThey're like tiny little flies and they fly around.
p211
aVAnd then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,
p212
aVwhich is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering \u2014
p213
aVwhat's the word I'm looking for? Murdering \u2014
p214
aVAudience: Bee?
p215
aVDennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVWhat these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,
p218
aVthey drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,
p219
aVand they collect pollen and make it into a ball,
p220
aVand they lay an egg on it.
p221
aVWell, these bees hang out at that hole,
p222
aVand they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,
p223
aVand lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.
p224
aVAnd so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,
p225
aVyou know that your environment is healthy,
p226
aVbecause they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.
p227
aVAnd in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators
p228
aVthat we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list
p229
aVare a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.
p230
aVAnd in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,
p231
aVgo to these websites here, and they're really looking for people
p232
aVto look for some of these bumblebees, because we think
p233
aVsome have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,
p236
aVbut we don't understand these native pollinators
p237
aVor all those other parts of our community.
p238
aVAnd of course, bees are not the only important factor here.
p239
aVThere are other animals that pollinate, like bats,
p240
aVand bats are in trouble too.
p241
aVAnd I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,
p242
aVbecause there's no money to research the bat problems.
p243
aVAnd bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
p244
aVWhite-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.
p245
aVIf there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,
p246
aVand there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco
p247
aVbecoming the population of half of this county in three years.
p248
aVAnd so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause
p251
aVof all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:
p252
aVNature Deficit Disorder.
p253
aVAnd that is that I think that what we have in our society is,
p254
aVwe forgot our connection with nature.
p255
aVAnd I think if we reconnect to nature,
p256
aVwe'll be able to have the resources and that interest
p257
aVto solve these problems.
p258
aVAnd I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
p259
aVAnd that is, make meadows and not lawns.
p260
aVAnd I think we have lost our connection,
p261
aVand this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.
p262
aVI've had the privilege of living by a meadow
p263
aVfor the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
p264
aVAnd if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.
p265
aVIt used to be, two, three hundred years ago,
p266
aVthat a lawn was a symbol of prestige,
p267
aVand so it was only the very rich that could keep these green
p268
aVactually, deserts: they're totally sterile.
p269
aVAmericans spent, in 2001 \u2014 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.
p270
aVFive percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent
p273
aVkeeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.
p274
aVAnd so we need to rethink this idea.
p275
aVIn fact, you know, the White House
p276
aVused to have sheep in front in order to help fund
p277
aVthe war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;
p278
aVit wouldn't be a bad idea.
p279
aVI want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.
p280
aVI think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns
p281
aVat a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.
p282
aVBut I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,
p283
aVbecause having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
p284
aVThat it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
p285
aVThese milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow
p286
aVover the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,
p287
aVor insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that \u2014
p288
aVand we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,
p289
aVthis companion you can have as it matures
p290
aVand as it has these different fragrances.
p291
aVAnd this is a companion,
p292
aVand this is a relationship that never dries up.
p293
aVYou never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.
p294
aVAnd I encourage you to look at that.
p295
aa(lp296
VNow, not all of us have meadows,
p297
aVor lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,
p298
aVgrow a meadow in a pot.
p299
aVBees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.
p300
aVSo I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,
p301
aVbut a pot in a meadow.
p302
aVBut you can also have this great community of city
p303
aVor building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live \u2014
p304
aVThis is in Paris where these beekeepers live.
p305
aVAnd everyone should open a beehive,
p306
aVbecause it is the most amazing, incredible thing.
p307
aVAnd if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,
p308
aVI think this is a great way of doing it.
p309
aVGet a beehive and grow a meadow,
p310
aVand watch that life come back into your life.
p311
aVAnd so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,
p312
aVwe can make sure that our future \u2014 our more perfect future \u2014
p313
aVincludes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.
p314
aVAnd that journey \u2014 that journey of transformation that occurs
p315
aVas you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees
p316
aVor you watch those native bees there \u2014 is an extremely exciting one.
p317
aVAnd I hope that you experience it
p318
aVand I hope you tell me about it one day.
p319
aVSo thank you very much for being here.  Thank you very much.
