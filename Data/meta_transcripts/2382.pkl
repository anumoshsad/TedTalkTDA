VIt's often said that you can tell a lot about a person
p4
aVby looking at what's on their bookshelves.
p5
aVWhat do my bookshelves say about me?
p6
aVWell, when I asked myself this question a few years ago,
p7
aVI made an alarming discovery.
p8
aVI'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured,
p9
aVcosmopolitan sort of person.
p10
aVBut my bookshelves told a rather different story.
p11
aVPretty much all the titles on them
p12
aVwere by British or North American authors,
p13
aVand there was almost nothing in translation.
p14
aVDiscovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading
p15
aVcame as quite a shock.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame.
p18
aVI knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there
p19
aVby writers working in languages other than English.
p20
aVAnd it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant
p21
aVI would probably never encounter them.
p22
aVSo, I decided to prescribe myself
p23
aVan intensive course of global reading.
p24
aV2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK;
p25
aVit was the year of the London Olympics.
p26
aVAnd so I decided to use it as my time frame
p27
aVto try to read a novel, short story collection
p28
aVor memoir from every country in the world.
p29
aVAnd so I did.
p30
aVAnd it was very exciting
p31
aVand I learned some remarkable things
p32
aVand made some wonderful connections
p33
aVthat I want to share with you today.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut it started with some practical problems.
p36
aVAfter I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world
p37
aVto use for my project,
p38
aVI ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations,
p39
aVto which I added Taiwan,
p40
aVwhich gave me a total of 196 countries.
p41
aVAnd after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging
p42
aVabout, roughly, four books a week
p43
aVaround working five days a week,
p44
aa(lp45
VI then had to face up to the fact that I might even not be able
p46
aVto get books in English from every country.
p47
aVOnly around 4.5 percent of the literary works published
p48
aVeach year in the UK are translations,
p49
aVand the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world.
p50
aVAlthough, the proportion of translated books published
p51
aVin many other countries is a lot higher.
p52
aV4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,
p53
aVbut what that figure doesn't tell you
p54
aVis that many of those books will come from countries
p55
aVwith strong publishing networks
p56
aVand lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles
p57
aVto English-language publishers.
p58
aVSo, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French
p59
aVand published in the UK each year,
p60
aVmost of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland.
p61
aVFrench-speaking Africa, on the other hand,
p62
aVwill rarely ever get a look-in.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations
p65
aVthat may have little or even no commercially available literature
p66
aVin English.
p67
aVTheir books remain invisible to readers
p68
aVof the world's most published language.
p69
aVBut when it came to reading the world,
p70
aVthe biggest challenge of all for me
p71
aVwas that fact that I didn't know where to start.
p72
aVHaving spent my life reading almost exclusively British
p73
aVand North American books,
p74
aVI had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories
p75
aVand choosing them from much of the rest of the world.
p76
aVI couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland.
p77
aVI wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.
p78
aVThere was no hiding it \u2014
p79
aVI was a clueless literary xenophobe.
p80
aVSo how on earth was I going to read the world?
p81
aa(lp82
VI was going to have to ask for help.
p83
aVSo in October 2011, I registered my blog,
p84
aVayearofreadingtheworld.com,
p85
aVand I posted a short appeal online.
p86
aVI explained who I was,
p87
aVhow narrow my reading had been,
p88
aVand I asked anyone who cared to
p89
aVto leave a message suggesting what I might read
p90
aVfrom other parts of the planet.
p91
aVNow, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested,
p92
aVbut within a few hours of me posting that appeal online,
p93
aVpeople started to get in touch.
p94
aVAt first, it was friends and colleagues.
p95
aVThen it was friends of friends.
p96
aVAnd pretty soon, it was strangers.
p97
aa(lp98
VFour days after I put that appeal online,
p99
aVI got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.
p100
aVShe said she loved the sound of my project,
p101
aVcould she go to her local English-language bookshop
p102
aVand choose my Malaysian book and post it to me?
p103
aVI accepted enthusiastically,
p104
aVand a few weeks later,
p105
aVa package arrived containing not one, but two books \u2014
p106
aVRafidah's choice from Malaysia,
p107
aVand a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me.
p108
aVNow, at the time, I was amazed
p109
aVthat a stranger more than 6,000 miles away
p110
aVwould go to such lengths to help someone
p111
aVshe would probably never meet.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year.
p114
aVTime and again, people went out of their way to help me.
p115
aVSome took on research on my behalf,
p116
aVand others made detours on holidays and business trips
p117
aVto go to bookshops for me.
p118
aVIt turns out, if you want to read the world,
p119
aVif you want to encounter it with an open mind,
p120
aVthe world will help you.
p121
aVWhen it came to countries
p122
aVwith little or no commercially available literature in English,
p123
aVpeople went further still.
p124
aa(lp125
VBooks often came from surprising sources.
p126
aVMy Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation
p127
aVI had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.
p128
aVYes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account.
p129
aVAnd when I tweeted at it about my project,
p130
aVit suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work
p131
aVof the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan.
p132
aVI found Morgan's website and I sent him a message,
p133
aVasking if any of his Spanish-language novels
p134
aVhad been translated into English.
p135
aVAnd he said that nothing had been published,
p136
aVbut he did have an unpublished translation
p137
aVof his novel "The Golden Horse."
p138
aVHe emailed this to me,
p139
aVallowing me to become one of the first people ever
p140
aVto read that book in English.
p141
aa(lp142
VMorgan was by no means the only wordsmith
p143
aVto share his work with me in this way.
p144
aVFrom Sweden to Palau,
p145
aVwriters and translators sent me self-published books
p146
aVand unpublished manuscripts of books
p147
aVthat hadn't been picked up by Anglophone publishers
p148
aVor that were no longer available,
p149
aVgiving me privileged glimpses of some remarkable imaginary worlds.
p150
aVI read, for example,
p151
aVabout the Southern African king Ngungunhane, who led the resistance
p152
aVagainst the Portuguese in the 19th century;
p153
aVand about marriage rituals in a remote village
p154
aVon the shores of the Caspian sea in Turkmenistan.
p155
aVI met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut perhaps the most amazing example
p162
aVof the lengths that people were prepared to go to
p163
aVto help me read the world,
p164
aVcame towards the end of my quest,
p165
aVwhen I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking
p166
aVAfrican island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe.
p167
aVNow, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find
p168
aVa book that had been translated into English from the nation,
p169
aVit seemed as though the only option left to me
p170
aVwas to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch.
p171
aVNow, I was really dubious
p172
aVwhether anyone was going to want to help with this,
p173
aVand give up their time for something like that.
p174
aVBut, within a week of me putting a call out on Twitter and Facebook
p175
aVfor Portuguese speakers,
p176
aVI had more people than I could involve in the project,
p177
aVincluding Margaret Jull Costa, a leader in her field,
p178
aVwho has translated the work of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.
p179
aVWith my nine volunteers in place,
p180
aVI managed to find a book by a São Toméan author
p181
aVthat I could buy enough copies of online.
p182
aVHere's one of them.
p183
aVAnd I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers.
p184
aVThey all took on a couple of short stories from this collection,
p185
aVstuck to their word, sent their translations back to me,
p186
aVand within six weeks, I had the entire book to read.
p187
aa(lp188
VIn that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world,
p189
aVmy not knowing and being open about my limitations
p190
aVhad become a big opportunity.
p191
aVWhen it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,
p192
aVit was a chance not only to learn something new
p193
aVand discover a new collection of stories,
p194
aVbut also to bring together a group of people
p195
aVand facilitate a joint creative endeavor.
p196
aVMy weakness had become the project's strength.
p197
aa(lp198
VThe books I read that year opened my eyes to many things.
p199
aVAs those who enjoy reading will know,
p200
aVbooks have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself
p201
aVand into someone else's mindset,
p202
aVso that, for a while at least,
p203
aVyou look at the world through different eyes.
p204
aVThat can be an uncomfortable experience,
p205
aVparticularly if you're reading a book
p206
aVfrom a culture that may have quite different values to your own.
p207
aVBut it can also be really enlightening.
p208
aVWrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking.
p209
aVAnd it can also show up blind spots
p210
aVin the way you might have been looking at the world.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhen I looked back at much of the English-language literature
p213
aVI'd grown up with, for example,
p214
aVI began to see how narrow a lot of it was,
p215
aVcompared to the richness that the world has to offer.
p216
aVAnd as the pages turned,
p217
aVsomething else started to happen, too.
p218
aVLittle by little,
p219
aVthat long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed
p220
aVfrom a rather dry, academic register of place names
p221
aVinto living, breathing entities.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible
p224
aVto get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book.
p225
aVBut cumulatively, the stories I read that year
p226
aVmade me more alive than ever before
p227
aVto the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet.
p228
aVIt was as though the world's stories
p229
aVand the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them
p230
aVhad made it real to me.
p231
aVThese days, when I look at my bookshelves
p232
aVor consider the works on my e-reader,
p233
aVthey tell a rather different story.
p234
aVIt's the story of the power books have to connect us
p235
aVacross political, geographical, cultural, social, religious divides.
p236
aVIt's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd, it's testament
p239
aVto the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet,
p240
aVit's easier than ever before
p241
aVfor a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book
p242
aVwith someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet.
p243
aVI hope it's a story I'm reading for many years to come.
p244
aVAnd I hope many more people will join me.
p245
aVIf we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive
p246
aVfor publishers to translate more books,
p247
aVand we would all be richer for that.
p248
