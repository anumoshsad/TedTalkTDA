VInterestingly, Charles Darwin
p4
aVwas born a very lightly pigmented man,
p5
aVin a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.
p6
aVOver the course of his life,
p7
aVDarwin had great privilege.
p8
aVHe lived in a fairly wealthy home.
p9
aVHe was raised by very supportive and interested parents.
p10
aVAnd when he was in his 20s
p11
aVhe embarked upon a remarkable voyage  on the ship the Beagle.
p12
aVAnd during the course of that voyage,
p13
aVhe saw remarkable things:
p14
aVtremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.
p15
aVAnd the observations that he made
p16
aVon that epic journey
p17
aVwere to be eventually distilled
p18
aVinto his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,"
p19
aVpublished 150 years ago.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow what is so interesting
p22
aVand to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous
p23
aVabout "The Origin of Species,"
p24
aVis that there is only one line in it
p25
aVabout human evolution.
p26
aV"Light will be thrown on the origin of man
p27
aVand his history."
p28
aVIt wasn't until much longer,
p29
aVmuch later,
p30
aVthat Darwin actually spoke
p31
aVand wrote about humans.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow in his years of
p34
aVtraveling on the Beagle,
p35
aVand from listening to the accounts
p36
aVor explorers and naturalists,
p37
aVhe knew that skin color
p38
aVwas one of the most important ways
p39
aVin which people varied.
p40
aVAnd he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.
p41
aVHe knew that darkly pigmented peoples
p42
aVwere found close to the equator;
p43
aVlightly pigmented peoples, like himself,
p44
aVwere found closer to the poles.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo what did he make of all this?
p47
aVWell he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.
p48
aVBut much later, in 1871,
p49
aVhe did have something to say about it.
p50
aVAnd it was quite curious. He said,
p51
aV"Of all the differences between the races of men,
p52
aVthe color of the skin is the most conspicuous
p53
aVand one of the best marked."
p54
aVAnd he went on to say,
p55
aV"These differences do not coincide
p56
aVwith corresponding differences in climate."
p57
aVSo he had traveled all around.
p58
aVHe had seen people of different colors
p59
aVliving in different places.
p60
aVAnd yet he rejected the idea
p61
aVthat human skin pigmentation
p62
aVwas related to the climate.
p63
aa(lp64
VIf only Darwin lived today.
p65
aVIf only Darwin had NASA.
p66
aVNow, one of the wonderful things that NASA does
p67
aVis it puts up a variety of satellites
p68
aVthat detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.
p69
aVAnd for many decades now
p70
aVthere have been a series of TOMS satellites
p71
aVthat have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.
p72
aVThe TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,
p73
aVshow the annual average
p74
aVultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.
p75
aVNow the really hot pink and red areas
p76
aVare those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts
p77
aVof UV during the year.
p78
aVThe incrementally cooler colors \u2014
p79
aVblues, greens, yellows, and finally grays \u2014
p80
aVindicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhat's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation
p83
aVis just how much of the Northern Hemisphere
p84
aVis in these cool gray zones.
p85
aVThis has tremendous implications for our understanding
p86
aVof the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
p87
aVAnd what Darwin could not appreciate,
p88
aVor didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,
p89
aVis that there was a fundamental relationship
p90
aVbetween the intensity of ultraviolet radiation
p91
aVand skin pigmentation.
p92
aVAnd that skin pigmentation itself
p93
aVwas a product of evolution.
p94
aVAnd so when we look at a map of skin color,
p95
aVand predicted skin color, as we know it today,
p96
aVwhat we see is a beautiful gradient
p97
aVfrom the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,
p98
aVand the lightest ones toward the poles.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhat's very, very important here
p101
aVis that the earliest humans
p102
aVevolved in high-UV environments,
p103
aVin equatorial Africa.
p104
aVThe earliest members of our lineage,
p105
aVthe genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.
p106
aVAnd we all share this incredible heritage
p107
aVof having originally been
p108
aVdarkly pigmented,
p109
aVtwo million to one and half million years ago.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow what happened in our history?
p112
aVLet's first look at the relationship
p113
aVof ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.
p114
aVIn those early days of our evolution,
p115
aVlooking at the equator,
p116
aVwe were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
p117
aVThe UVC, the most energetic type,
p118
aVwas occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.
p119
aVBut UVB and UVA
p120
aVespecially, came in unimpeded.
p121
aVUVB turns out to be incredibly important.
p122
aVIt's very destructive,
p123
aVbut it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,
p124
aVvitamin D being a molecule that we very much need
p125
aVfor our strong bones, the health of our immune system,
p126
aVand myriad other important functions in our bodies.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, living at the equator, we got
p129
aVlots and lots of ultraviolet radiation
p130
aVand the melanin \u2014
p131
aVthis wonderful, complex, ancient polymer
p132
aVcompound in our skin \u2014
p133
aVserved as a superb natural sunscreen.
p134
aVThis polymer is amazing
p135
aVbecause it's present in so many different organisms.
p136
aVMelanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth
p137
aVa billion years,
p138
aVand has been recruited over and over again
p139
aVby evolution, as often happens.
p140
aVWhy change it if it works?
p141
aa(lp142
VSo melanin was recruited, in our lineage,
p143
aVand specifically in our earliest ancestors
p144
aVevolving in Africa,
p145
aVto be a natural sunscreen.
p146
aVWhere it protected the body
p147
aVagainst the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,
p148
aVthe destruction, or damage to DNA,
p149
aVand the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,
p150
aVwhich helps to fuel cell production,
p151
aVand reproduction in the body.
p152
aVSo, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,
p153
aVwonderful covering of melanin.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut then we moved.
p156
aVAnd humans dispersed \u2014 not once, but twice.
p157
aVMajor moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,
p158
aVfrom Africa into other parts of the Old World,
p159
aVand most recently, into the New World.
p160
aVWhen humans dispersed into these latitudes,
p161
aVwhat did they face?
p162
aVConditions were significantly colder,
p163
aVbut they were also less intense
p164
aVwith respect to the ultraviolet regime.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,
p167
aVlook at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.
p168
aVWe're still getting a dose of UVA.
p169
aVBut all of the UVB,
p170
aVor nearly all of it,
p171
aVis dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.
p172
aVIn the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,
p173
aVyou may experience ultraviolet radiation.
p174
aVBut it's all UVA,
p175
aVand, significantly, that UVA
p176
aVhas no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments
p179
aVwere bereft of the potential
p180
aVto make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.
p181
aVThis had tremendous consequences
p182
aVfor the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
p183
aVBecause what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,
p184
aVthese lineages of people
p185
aVdispersing into the Northern Hemisphere
p186
aVlost their pigmentation.
p187
aVThere was natural selection
p188
aVfor the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.
p189
aa(lp190
VHere we begin to see the evolution
p191
aVof the beautiful sepia rainbow
p192
aVthat now characterizes all of humanity.
p193
aVLightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,
p194
aVnot just twice, but probably three times.
p195
aVNot just in modern humans,
p196
aVbut in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,
p197
aVthe Neanderthals.
p198
aVA remarkable, remarkable testament
p199
aVto the power of evolution.
p200
aVHumans have been on the move for a long time.
p201
aVAnd just in the last 5,000 years,
p202
aVin increasing rates, over increasing distances.
p203
aVHere are just some of the biggest movements of people,
p204
aVvoluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.
p205
aa(lp206
VLook at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:
p207
aVpeople from high UV areas
p208
aVgoing to low UV and vice versa.
p209
aVAnd not all these moves were voluntary.
p210
aVBetween 1520 and 1867,
p211
aV12 million, 500 people
p212
aVwere moved from high UV
p213
aVto low UV areas
p214
aVin the transatlantic slave trade.
p215
aVNow this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.
p216
aVBut it also had deleterious
p217
aVhealth consequences to people.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what? We've been on the move.
p220
aVWe're so clever we can overcome all of these
p221
aVseeming biological impediments.
p222
aVWell, often we're unaware
p223
aVof the fact that we're living
p224
aVin environments in which our skin
p225
aVis inherently poorly adapted.
p226
aVSome of us with lightly pigmented skin
p227
aVlive in high-UV areas.
p228
aVSome of us with darkly pigmented skin
p229
aVlive in low-UV areas.
p230
aVThese have tremendous consequences for our health.
p231
aa(lp232
VWe have to, if we're lightly pigmented,
p233
aVbe careful about the problems of skin cancer,
p234
aVand destruction of folate in our bodies,
p235
aVby lots of sun.
p236
aVEpidemiologists and doctors
p237
aVhave been very good about telling us
p238
aVabout protecting our skin.
p239
aVWhat they haven't been so good about instructing people
p240
aVis the problem of darkly pigmented people
p241
aVliving in high latitude areas,
p242
aVor working inside all the time.
p243
aa(lp244
VBecause the problem there is just as severe,
p245
aVbut it is more sinister,
p246
aVbecause vitamin D deficiency,
p247
aVfrom a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,
p248
aVis a major problem.
p249
aVVitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,
p250
aVand causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,
p251
aVto their gradual decay of their immune systems,
p252
aVor loss of immune function,
p253
aVand probably some problems
p254
aVwith their mood and health,
p255
aVtheir mental health.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo we have, in skin pigmentation,
p258
aVone of these wonderful products of evolution
p259
aVthat still has consequences for us today.
p260
aVAnd the social consequences,
p261
aVas we know, are incredibly profound.
p262
aVWe live in a world where we
p263
aVhave lightly and darkly pigmented people
p264
aVliving next to one another,
p265
aVbut often brought into proximity initially
p266
aVas a result of very invidious social interactions.
p267
aVSo how can we overcome this?
p268
aVHow can we begin to understand it?
p269
aVEvolution helps us.
p270
aa(lp271
V200 years after Darwin's birthday,
p272
aVwe have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.
p273
aV(Applause)
p274
aVHow wonderful is that?
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVThis man is significant for a whole host of reasons.
p277
aVBut we need to think about how he compares,
p278
aVin terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.
p279
aVHe, as one of many urban admixed populations,
p280
aVis very emblematic
p281
aVof a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.
p282
aVAnd he resembles, very closely,
p283
aVpeople with moderate levels of pigmentation
p284
aVwho live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.
p285
aa(lp286
VThese people have a tremendous potential
p287
aVto tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,
p288
aVas a result of exposure to sun.
p289
aVThey also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,
p290
aVif they have desk jobs, like that guy.
p291
aVSo lets all wish for his great health,
p292
aVand his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow what is wonderful
p295
aVabout the evolution of human skin pigmentation,
p296
aVand the phenomenon of pigmentation,
p297
aVis that it is the demonstration,
p298
aVthe evidence, of evolution
p299
aVby natural selection,
p300
aVright on your body.
p301
aVWhen people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"
p302
aVYou don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.
p303
aVYou just have to look at your skin.
p304
aa(lp305
VDarwin, I think, would have appreciated this,
p306
aVeven though he eschewed the importance
p307
aVof climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.
p308
aVI think, were he able to look
p309
aVat the evidence we have today, he would understand it.
p310
aVHe would appreciate it.
p311
aVAnd most of all, he would teach it.
p312
aa(lp313
VYou, you can teach it.
p314
aVYou can touch it.
p315
aVYou can understand it.
p316
aVTake it out of this room.
p317
aVTake your skin color,
p318
aVand celebrate it.
p319
aVSpread the word.
p320
aVYou have the evolution
p321
aVof the history of our species,
p322
aVpart of it, written in your skin.
p323
aVUnderstand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.
p324
aVGo out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?
p325
aVYou are the products of evolution.
p326
aVThank you.
