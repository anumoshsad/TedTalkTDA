VI would like to share with you this morning
p4
aVsome stories about the ocean
p5
aVthrough my work as a still photographer
p6
aVfor National Geographic magazine.
p7
aVI guess I became an underwater photographer
p8
aVand a photojournalist
p9
aVbecause I fell in love with the sea as a child.
p10
aVAnd I wanted to tell stories
p11
aVabout all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,
p12
aVincredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.
p13
aVAnd after even 30 years of doing this,
p14
aVafter 30 years of exploring the ocean,
p15
aVI never cease to be amazed
p16
aVat the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.
p17
aVBut more and more frequently these days
p18
aVI'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,
p19
aVthings that I don't think most people realize.
p20
aVAnd I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues
p21
aVto tell a more complete story.
p22
aVI want people to see what's happening underwater,
p23
aVboth the horror and the magic.
p24
aa(lp25
VThe first story that I did for National Geographic,
p26
aVwhere I recognized the ability to include
p27
aVenvironmental issues within a natural history coverage,
p28
aVwas a story I proposed on harp seals.
p29
aVThe story I wanted to do initially
p30
aVwas just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year
p31
aVwhere these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic
p32
aVto the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada
p33
aVto engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.
p34
aVAnd all of this is played out against
p35
aVthe backdrop of transient pack ice
p36
aVthat moves with wind and tide.
p37
aVAnd because I'm an underwater photographer,
p38
aVI wanted to do this story from both above and below,
p39
aVto make pictures like this that show one of these little pups
p40
aVmaking its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.
p41
aVBut as I got more involved in the story,
p42
aVI realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.
p43
aVThe first was that these animals continue to be hunted,
p44
aVkilled with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.
p45
aVIt actually is the largest marine mammal
p46
aVslaughter on the planet,
p47
aVwith hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut as disturbing as that is,
p50
aVI think the bigger problem for harp seals
p51
aVis the loss of sea ice due to global warming.
p52
aVThis is an aerial picture that I made that shows
p53
aVthe Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.
p54
aVAnd even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,
p55
aVthere's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.
p56
aVAnd the ice that is there is quite thin.
p57
aVThe problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice
p58
aVin order to nurse from their moms.
p59
aVThey only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.
p60
aVBut if they don't get 12 days,
p61
aVthey can fall into the ocean and die.
p62
aVThis is a photo that I made showing
p63
aVone of these pups that's only about five or seven days old \u2014
p64
aVstill has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly \u2014
p65
aVthat has fallen in because of the thin ice,
p66
aVand the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe
p67
aVand to get it back to stable purchase.
p68
aVThis problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.
p69
aVI read that last year the pup mortality rate
p70
aVwas 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
p71
aVSo, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.
p72
aVThis ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.
p73
aVAnd it received quite a bit of attention.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd with that, I saw the potential to begin
p76
aVdoing other stories about ocean problems.
p77
aVSo I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,
p78
aVin part because I had personally witnessed
p79
aVa lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,
p80
aVbut also because I read a scientific paper
p81
aVthat stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean
p82
aVhave disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
p83
aVThese are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.
p84
aVWhen I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.
p85
aVI thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,
p86
aVbut it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story
p87
aVthat was a very different kind of underwater story.
p88
aVI wanted it to be more like war photography,
p89
aVwhere I was making harder-hitting pictures
p90
aVthat showed readers what was happening
p91
aVto marine wildlife around the planet.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,
p94
aVwas to give readers a sense of appreciation
p95
aVfor the ocean animals that they were eating.
p96
aVYou know, I think people go into a restaurant,
p97
aVand somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,
p98
aVand somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,
p99
aVbut when they're eating bluefin sushi,
p100
aVdo they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?
p101
aVThese are the lions and tigers of the sea.
p102
aVIn reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;
p103
aVthey're unique in the world.
p104
aVThese are animals that can practically swim
p105
aVfrom the equator to the poles
p106
aVand can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.
p107
aVIf we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,
p108
aVwould have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.
p109
aVBut the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,
p110
aVand their stocks have collapsed worldwide.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market
p113
aVthat I photographed a couple years ago.
p114
aVAnd every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,
p115
aVare stacked up like cordwood,
p116
aVjust warehouse after warehouse.
p117
aVAs I wandered around and made these pictures,
p118
aVit sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.
p119
aVWe can't keep taking without expecting
p120
aVserious consequences as a result.
p121
aa(lp122
VI also, with the story, wanted to show readers
p123
aVhow fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,
p124
aVlike a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.
p125
aVThis was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,
p126
aVbut the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.
p127
aVYou have a large net in the middle
p128
aVwith two steel doors on either end.
p129
aVAnd as this assembly is towed through the water,
p130
aVthe doors meet resistance with the ocean,
p131
aVand it opens the mouth of the net,
p132
aVand they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
p133
aVAnd this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.
p134
aVBut as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.
p135
aVAnd it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,
p136
aVthings like sponges and corals,
p137
aVthat critical habitat for other animals.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis photograph I made of the fisherman
p140
aVholding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.
p141
aVSo he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,
p142
aVand all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.
p143
aVThese are animals that died in the process,
p144
aVbut have no commercial value.
p145
aVSo this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,
p146
aVmaybe seven or eight shrimp
p147
aVand 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.
p148
aVAnd to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat
p149
aVand made this picture of the guy shoveling
p150
aVthis bycatch into the sea as trash
p151
aVand photographed this cascade of death,
p152
aVyou know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,
p153
aVflounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,
p154
aVwere on the bottom of the ocean, alive,
p155
aVbut now being thrown back as trash.
p156
aa(lp157
VI also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry
p158
aVbecause, currently on planet Earth,
p159
aVwe're killing over 100 million sharks
p160
aVevery single year.
p161
aVBut before I went out to photograph this component,
p162
aVI sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark
p163
aVthat will resonate with readers
p164
aVYou know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think
p165
aVthe only good shark is a dead shark.
p166
aVBut this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher
p167
aVthat had just recently died in the gill net.
p168
aVAnd with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,
p169
aVit struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.
p170
aVThis ended up being the lead picture
p171
aVin the global fishery story in National Geographic.
p172
aVAnd I hope that it helped readers to take notice
p173
aVof this problem of 100 million sharks.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd because I love sharks \u2014 I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks \u2014
p176
aVI wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,
p177
aVas a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.
p178
aVSo I went to the Bahamas
p179
aVbecause there're very few places in the world
p180
aVwhere sharks are doing well these days,
p181
aVbut the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,
p182
aVlargely due to the fact that the government there
p183
aVhad outlawed longlining several years ago.
p184
aVAnd I wanted to show several species
p185
aVthat we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
p186
aa(lp187
VOne of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,
p188
aVin the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks
p189
aVaggregate in shallow water.
p190
aVThis is a low-altitude photograph that I made
p191
aVshowing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks
p192
aVsort of just swimming around behind.
p193
aVBut the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage
p194
aVwas to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.
p195
aVI didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.
p196
aVAnd with this photograph of a beautiful
p197
aV15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,
p198
aVfemale tiger shark,
p199
aVI sort of think I got to that goal,
p200
aVwhere she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,
p201
aVand my strobe created a shadow on her face.
p202
aVAnd I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,
p203
aVa little more respectful of the species.
p204
aa(lp205
VI also searched on this story
p206
aVfor the elusive great hammerhead,
p207
aVan animal that really hadn't been photographed much
p208
aVuntil maybe about seven or 10 years ago.
p209
aVIt's a very solitary creature.
p210
aVBut this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science
p211
aVin both Florida and in the Bahamas.
p212
aVYou know, we know almost nothing about them.
p213
aVWe don't know where they migrate to or from,
p214
aVwhere they mate, where they have their pups,
p215
aVand yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic
p216
aVhave declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.
p217
aVYou know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.
p218
aa(lp219
VThis is the oceanic whitetip shark,
p220
aVan animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,
p221
aVif you pay attention to such lists.
p222
aVBut it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline
p223
aVthroughout most of its range.
p224
aVBecause this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,
p225
aVand because we weren't working on the bottom,
p226
aVI brought along a shark cage here,
p227
aVand my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.
p228
aVYou'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,
p229
aVso clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd lastly with this story,
p232
aVI also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.
p233
aVAnd I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,
p234
aVto work with lemon shark pups.
p235
aVThis is a photo of a lemon shark pup,
p236
aVand it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives
p237
aVin these protective mangroves.
p238
aVThis is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.
p239
aVIt's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.
p240
aVBut, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long
p241
aVswimming in about a foot of water.
p242
aVBut this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,
p243
aVuntil they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.
p244
aVAfter I left Bimini, I actually learned
p245
aVthat this habitat was being bulldozed
p246
aVto create a new golf course and resort.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd other recent stories have looked at
p249
aVsingle, flagship species, if you will,
p250
aVthat are at risk in the ocean
p251
aVas a way of talking about other threats.
p252
aVOne such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.
p253
aVThis is the largest, widest-ranging,
p254
aVdeepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.
p255
aVHere we see a female crawling
p256
aVout of the ocean under moonlight
p257
aVon the island of Trinidad.
p258
aVThese are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.
p259
aVAnd there was a time in their lifespan
p260
aVwhere they were coming out of the water to nest
p261
aVand saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.
p262
aVAnd today, they crawl out and see condominiums.
p263
aVBut despite this amazing longevity,
p264
aVthey're now considered critically endangered.
p265
aVIn the Pacific, where I made this photograph,
p266
aVtheir stocks have declined about 90 percent
p267
aVin the last 15 years.
p268
aa(lp269
VThis is a photograph that shows a hatchling
p270
aVabout to taste saltwater for the very first time
p271
aVbeginning this long and perilous journey.
p272
aVOnly one in a thousand
p273
aVleatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.
p274
aVBut that's due to natural predators
p275
aVlike vultures that pick them off on a beach
p276
aVor predatory fish that are waiting offshore.
p277
aVNature has learned to compensate with that,
p278
aVand females have multiple clutches of eggs
p279
aVto overcome those odds.
p280
aVBut what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,
p281
aVhuman things, like this picture that shows
p282
aVa leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
p283
aVI actually jumped in and photographed this,
p284
aVand with the fisherman's permission,
p285
aVI cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.
p286
aVBut, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year
p287
aVare not so fortunate,
p288
aVand the species' future is in great danger.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnother charismatic megafauna species that I worked with
p291
aVis the story I did on the right whale.
p292
aVAnd essentially, the story is this with right whales,
p293
aVthat about a million years ago, there was
p294
aVone species of right whale on the planet,
p295
aVbut as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,
p296
aVthe species sort of separated,
p297
aVand today we have essentially two distinct stocks.
p298
aVWe have the Southern right whale that we see here
p299
aVand the North Atlantic right whale that we see here
p300
aVwith a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.
p301
aVNow, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction
p302
aVby the early whalers,
p303
aVbut the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better
p304
aVbecause they're located in places
p305
aVfarther away from human activity.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe North Atlantic right whale is listed as
p308
aVthe most endangered species on the planet today
p309
aVbecause they are urban whales; they live along the east coast
p310
aVof North America, United States and Canada,
p311
aVand they have to deal with all these urban ills.
p312
aVThis photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.
p313
aVYou can see the coal burning plant in the background.
p314
aVThey have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals
p315
aVthat are flushed out into the ocean,
p316
aVand maybe even affecting their reproduction.
p317
aVThey also get entangled in fishing gear.
p318
aVThis is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.
p319
aVAnd those white markings are not natural markings.
p320
aVThese are entanglement scars.
p321
aV72 percent of the population has such scars,
p322
aVbut most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.
p323
aVThey hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.
p324
aVAnd the other problem is they get hit by ships.
p325
aVAnd this was an animal that was struck by a ship
p326
aVin Nova Scotia, Canada
p327
aVbeing towed in, where they did a necropsy
p328
aVto confirm the cause of death,
p329
aVwhich was indeed a ship strike.
p330
aVSo all of these ills are stacking up against these animals
p331
aVand keeping their numbers very low.
p332
aa(lp333
VAnd to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,
p334
aVI went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
p335
aVthat had only been discovered about 10 years ago
p336
aVin the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.
p337
aVI went down there in the winter time.
p338
aVAnd these are animals that had never seen humans before,
p339
aVand I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.
p340
aVAnd I got in the water with them,
p341
aVand I was amazed at how curious they were.
p342
aVThis photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet
p343
aVand one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,
p344
aV70-ton whales,
p345
aVlike a city bus just swimming up, you know.
p346
aVThey were in perfect condition,
p347
aVvery fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,
p348
aVthe way they're supposed to look.
p349
aVYou know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock
p350
aVin Massachusetts in 1620,
p351
aVwrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay
p352
aVon the backs of right whales.
p353
aVAnd we can't go back and see that today,
p354
aVbut maybe we can preserve what we have left.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,
p357
aVa story I did on marine reserves
p358
aVas sort of a solution
p359
aVto the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.
p360
aVI settled on working in the country of New Zealand
p361
aVbecause New Zealand was rather progressive,
p362
aVand is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
p363
aVAnd I really wanted this story to be about three things:
p364
aVI wanted it to be about abundance,
p365
aVabout diversity and about resilience.
p366
aVAnd one of the first places I worked
p367
aVwas a reserve called Goat Island
p368
aVin Leigh of New Zealand.
p369
aVWhat the scientists there told me was that
p370
aVwhen protected this first marine reserve in 1975,
p371
aVthey hoped and expected that certain things might happen.
p372
aa(lp373
VFor example, they hoped that certain species of fish
p374
aVlike the New Zealand snapper would return
p375
aVbecause they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
p376
aVAnd they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.
p377
aVFor example, these fish
p378
aVpredate on sea urchins,
p379
aVand when the fish were all gone,
p380
aVall anyone ever saw underwater
p381
aVwas just acres and acres of sea urchins.
p382
aVBut when the fish came back
p383
aVand began predating and controlling the urchin population,
p384
aVlow and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.
p385
aVAnd that's because the urchins eat kelp.
p386
aVSo when the fish control the urchin population,
p387
aVthe ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.
p388
aVYou know, this is probably how the ocean looked here
p389
aVone or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.
p390
aa(lp391
VI worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,
p392
aVin beautiful, fragile, protected areas
p393
aVlike in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.
p394
aVLittle blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.
p395
aVIn the northern part of New Zealand,
p396
aVI dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,
p397
aVand photographed animals like this giant sting ray
p398
aVswimming through an underwater canyon.
p399
aVEvery part of the ecosystem in this place
p400
aVseems very healthy,
p401
aVfrom tiny, little animals like a nudibrank
p402
aVcrawling over encrusting sponge
p403
aVor a leatherjacket
p404
aVthat is a very important animal in this ecosystem
p405
aVbecause it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd I wanted to finish with this photograph,
p408
aVa picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand
p409
aVwhen I just laid on the bottom
p410
aVamidst a school of fish swirling around me.
p411
aVAnd I was in a place that had only been protected
p412
aVabout 20 years ago.
p413
aVAnd I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,
p414
aVand they said that the marine life was better here today
p415
aVthan it was in the 1960s.
p416
aVAnd that's because it's been protected,
p417
aVthat it has come back.
p418
aa(lp419
VSo I think the message is clear.
p420
aVThe ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,
p421
aVbut we must be good custodians.
p422
aVI became an underwater photographer
p423
aVbecause I fell in love with the sea,
p424
aVand I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,
p425
aVand I don't think it's too late.
p426
