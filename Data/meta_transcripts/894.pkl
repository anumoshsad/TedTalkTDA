VSo, these are
p4
aVthe Dark Ages.
p5
aVAnd the Dark Ages are the time between
p6
aVwhen you put away the Lego
p7
aVfor the last time as a kid,
p8
aVand you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.
p9
aVStarted out with my then four-year-old:
p10
aV"Oh, should buy the kid some Lego.
p11
aVThat stuff's cool."
p12
aVWalked into the Lego store.
p13
aVBought him this.
p14
aVIt's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVI think the box says \u2014
p17
aVlet's see here \u2014
p18
aV"8 to 12" on it.
p19
aVI turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"
p20
aVShe's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."
p21
aa(lp22
VPretty soon it got a little bit out of control.
p23
aVThe dining room looked like this.
p24
aVYou walk there, and it hurts.
p25
aVSo we took a room downstairs in the basement
p26
aVthat had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVTorture, very funny.
p29
aVWow, you guys are great.
p30
aVAnd we put down those little floor tiles,
p31
aVand then I went onto eBay
p32
aVand bought 150 pounds of Lego \u2014
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVwhich is insane.
p35
aVMy daughter \u2014 the day we got it, I was tucking her in \u2014
p36
aVand I said,
p37
aV"Honey, you're my treasure."
p38
aVAnd she said, "No, the Lego is the treasure."
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnd then she said, "Dad, we're Lego rich."
p41
aVI was like, "Yeah.
p42
aVI suppose we are."
p43
aVSo then once you do that
p44
aVyou're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"
p45
aVSo you go to The Container Store
p46
aVand spend an enormous amount of money,
p47
aVand then you start this crazy sorting process
p48
aVthat never \u2014
p49
aVit's just nuts.
p50
aVWhatever.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo then you realize there are these conventions.
p53
aVAnd you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.
p54
aVAnd you're like, "Holy shit!
p55
aVHe had to come in like a truck,
p56
aVa semi, with this thing."
p57
aVAnd then someone built this \u2014 this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.
p58
aVJust beautiful.
p59
aVAnd there's a dude selling these
p60
aVaftermarket weapons for Lego,
p61
aVbecause Lego \u2014 the Danish \u2014
p62
aVno, they're not into guns.
p63
aVBut the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for Lego, no problem.
p64
aVAnd at a certain point, you look around,
p65
aVyou're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."
p66
aVAnd I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,
p67
aVbut that's like a couple of levels above furries.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVThe nerds here, they get laid \u2014
p70
aVexcept for the lady with the condoms in her pocket \u2014
p71
aVand you say to yourself at some point,
p72
aV"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"
p73
aVAnd I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.
p74
aVI'm coming out.
p75
aVI'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."
p76
aa(lp77
VSo then you really get into it,
p78
aVand you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this software
p79
aVto let you build your own virtually."
p80
aVAnd so this is like this CAD program where you build it.
p81
aVAnd then whatever you design virtually,
p82
aVyou click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.
p83
aVAnd then some of the designs that people do
p84
aVthey actually sell in the store.
p85
aVThe Lego guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,
p86
aVbut some user made this and then it sold.
p87
aVAnd it's pretty amazing actually.
p88
aa(lp89
VThen you notice that if that
p90
aVLego-provided CAD program isn't enough,
p91
aVthere's an entire open-source, third-party,
p92
aVindependent Lego CAD program
p93
aVthat lets you do 3D modeling
p94
aVand 3D rendering
p95
aVand make, in fact, movies out of Lego,
p96
aV3D films
p97
aVof which there are thousands on YouTube,
p98
aVand some of them sort of mimicking famous films
p99
aVand some totally original content \u2014
p100
aVjust beautiful \u2014
p101
aVand people recreating all sorts of things.
p102
aVI have to take a moment.
p103
aVI love the guy who's like running away
p104
aVwith his clasps, his hooks.
p105
aVOkay. Anyway.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VThere's a whole programming language and robotics tool,
p110
aVso if you want to teach someone how to program,
p111
aVkid, adult, whatever it is.
p112
aVAnd the guy that made this,
p113
aVhe made a slot machine out of Lego.
p114
aVAnd I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine;
p115
aVI mean he made a slot machine out of Lego.
p116
aVThe insides were Lego.
p117
aa(lp118
VThere's people getting drunk building Lego,
p119
aVand you've got to finish the thing before you puke.
p120
aVThere's a whole gray market for Lego,
p121
aVthousands of home-based businesses.
p122
aVAnd some people will fund their entire Lego habit
p123
aVby selling the little guy,
p124
aVbut then you have no guys in your ships.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.
p127
aVThis is amazing what you can do.
p128
aVAnd don't kid yourself:
p129
aVsome architectural details, incredible organic shapes
p130
aVand just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.
p131
aVThis is my house.
p132
aVAnd this is my house.
p133
aVI was afraid a car was going to come smash it
p134
aVas I was taking a picture for you guys.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnyway, I'm out of time.
p137
aVBut just very quickly \u2014
p138
aVwe'll just see if I can do this quick.
p139
aVBecause there aren't enough TED logos around here.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVLet's see here.
p142
aVOkay.
p143
aVTa-da.
