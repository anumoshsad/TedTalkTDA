VIn the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time
p4
aVwith only one suitcase of clothes.
p5
aVOne day, I was invited to an important event,
p6
aVand I wanted to wear something special and new for it.
p7
aVSo I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear.
p8
aVI was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day,
p9
aVand I had access to 3D printers.
p10
aVSo I quickly designed a skirt on my computer,
p11
aVand I loaded the file on the printer.
p12
aVIt just printed the pieces overnight.
p13
aVThe next morning, I just took all the pieces,
p14
aVassembled them together in my hotel room,
p15
aVand this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Applause)
p18
aa(lp19
VSo it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes.
p20
aVFor my senior collection at fashion design school,
p21
aVI decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home.
p22
aVThe problem was that I barely knew anything about 3D printing,
p23
aVand I had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks.
p24
aa(lp25
VI always felt most creative when I worked from home.
p26
aVI loved experimenting with new materials,
p27
aVand I always tried to develop new techniques
p28
aVto make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects.
p29
aVI loved going to old factories and weird stores
p30
aVin search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials,
p31
aVand then bring them home to experiment on.
p32
aVAs you can probably imagine,
p33
aVmy roommates didn't like that at all.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo I decided to move on to working with big machines,
p38
aVones that didn't fit in my living room.
p39
aVI love the exact and the custom work I can do
p40
aVwith all kinds of fashion technologies,
p41
aVlike knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing.
p42
aa(lp43
VOne summer break, I came here to New York for an internship
p44
aVat a fashion house in Chinatown.
p45
aVWe worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed.
p46
aVThey were amazing \u2014 like you can see here.
p47
aVBut I had a few issues with them.
p48
aVThey were made from hard plastics and that's why they were very breakable.
p49
aVThe models couldn't sit in them,
p50
aVand they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms.
p51
aa(lp52
VWith 3D printing, the designers had so much freedom
p53
aVto make the dresses look exactly like they wanted,
p54
aVbut still, they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers
p55
aVthat were located in a lab far from their studio.
p56
aa(lp57
VLater that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace,
p58
aVprinted using a home printer.
p59
aVI knew that these printers were much cheaper
p60
aVand much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship.
p61
aVSo I looked at the necklace,
p62
aVand then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home,
p63
aVwhy not print my clothes from home, too?"
p64
aVI really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market
p65
aVand pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell \u2014
p66
aVI could just design them and print them directly from home.
p67
aa(lp68
VI found a small makerspace,
p69
aVwhere I learned everything I know about 3D printing.
p70
aVRight away, they literally gave me the key to the lab,
p71
aVso I could experiment into the night, every night.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with.
p74
aVSo what is a filament?
p75
aVFilament is the material you feed the printer with.
p76
aVAnd I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA,
p77
aVwhich is a hard and scratchy, breakable material.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex,
p80
aVwhich is a new kind of filament.
p81
aVIt's strong, yet very flexible.
p82
aVAnd with it, I was able to print the first garment,
p83
aVthe red jacket that had the word "Liberté" \u2014
p84
aV"freedom" in French \u2014
p85
aVembedded into it.
p86
aVI chose this word because I felt so empowered and free
p87
aVwhen I could just design a garment from my home
p88
aVand then print it by myself.
p89
aVAnd actually, you can easily download this jacket,
p90
aVand easily change the word to something else.
p91
aVFor example, your name or your sweetheart's name.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VSo the printer plates are small,
p96
aVso I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd I wanted to solve another challenge.
p99
aVI wanted to print textiles
p100
aVthat I would use just like regular fabrics.
p101
aVThat's when I found an open-source file
p102
aVfrom an architect who designed a pattern that I love.
p103
aVAnd with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile
p104
aVthat I would use just like a regular fabric.
p105
aVAnd it actually even looks a little bit like lace.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it \u2014
p108
aVmany kinds of versions out of it.
p109
aVAnd I needed to print another 1,500 more hours
p110
aVto complete printing my collection.
p111
aVSo I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7.
p112
aVAnd this is actually a really slow process,
p113
aVbut let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago,
p114
aVso 3D printing will also accelerate
p115
aVand in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home
p116
aVin just a couple of hours, or even minutes.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo you guys, you want to see what it looks like?
p119
aa(lp120
VAudience: Yeah!
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VDanit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits.
p125
aVAlmost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home.
p126
aVEven her shoes are printed.
p127
aa(lp128
VAudience: Wow!
p129
aa(lp130
VAudience: Cool!
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VDanit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.
p135
aV(To audience) Thank you, guys.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo I think in the future, materials will evolve,
p138
aVand they will look and feel like fabrics we know today,
p139
aVlike cotton or silk.
p140
aVImagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements.
p141
aa(lp142
VMusic was once a very physical thing.
p143
aVYou would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs,
p144
aVbut now you can just download the music \u2014
p145
aVdigital music \u2014
p146
aVdirectly to your phone.
p147
aVFashion is also a very physical thing.
p148
aVAnd I wonder what our world will look like
p149
aVwhen our clothes will be digital, just like this skirt is.
p150
aa(lp151
VThank you so much.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
