VI'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.
p4
aVBut before I show you what I've got inside,
p5
aVI'm going to make a very public confession,
p6
aVand that is,
p7
aVI'm outfit-obsessed.
p8
aVI love finding, wearing,
p9
aVand more recently,
p10
aVphotographing and blogging
p11
aVa different, colorful, crazy outfit
p12
aVfor every single occasion.
p13
aVBut I don't buy anything new.
p14
aVI get all my clothes secondhand
p15
aVfrom flea markets and thrift stores.
p16
aVAww, thank you.
p17
aVSecondhand shopping
p18
aVallows me to reduce the impact
p19
aVmy wardrobe has on the environment
p20
aVand on my wallet.
p21
aVI get to meet all kinds of great people;
p22
aVmy dollars usually go to a good cause;
p23
aVI look pretty unique;
p24
aVand it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.
p25
aVI mean, what am I going to find today?
p26
aVIs it going to be my size?
p27
aVWill I like the color?
p28
aVWill it be under $20?
p29
aVIf all the answers are yes,
p30
aVI feel as though I've won.
p31
aa(lp32
VI want to get back to my suitcase
p33
aVand tell you what I packed
p34
aVfor this exciting week here at TED.
p35
aVI mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?
p36
aVSo I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
p37
aVI brought seven pairs of underpants
p38
aVand that's it.
p39
aVExactly one week's worth of undies
p40
aVis all I put in my suitcase.
p41
aVI was betting that I'd be able to find
p42
aVeverything else I could possible want to wear
p43
aVonce I got here to Palm Springs.
p44
aVAnd since you don't know me
p45
aVas the woman walking around TED in her underwear \u2014
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVthat means I found a few things.
p48
aVAnd I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.
p49
aVDoes that sound good?
p50
aV(Applause)
p51
aVSo as I do this,
p52
aVI'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons
p53
aVthat, believe it or not, I have picked up
p54
aVin these adventures wearing nothing new.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo let's start with Sunday.
p57
aVI call this "Shiny Tiger."
p58
aVYou do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
p59
aVYou can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
p60
aVThis whole outfit, including the jacket,
p61
aVcost me $55,
p62
aVand it was the most expensive thing
p63
aVthat I wore the entire week.
p64
aa(lp65
VMonday: Color is powerful.
p66
aVIt is almost physiologically impossible
p67
aVto be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVIf you are happy,
p70
aVyou are going to attract other happy people to you.
p71
aa(lp72
VTuesday:
p73
aVFitting in is way overrated.
p74
aVI've spent a whole lot of my life
p75
aVtrying to be myself
p76
aVand at the same time fit in.
p77
aVJust be who you are.
p78
aVIf you are surrounding yourself with the right people,
p79
aVthey will not only get it,
p80
aVthey will appreciate it.
p81
aa(lp82
VWednesday:
p83
aVEmbrace your inner child.
p84
aVSometimes people tell me
p85
aVthat I look like I'm playing dress-up,
p86
aVor that I remind them of their seven-year-old.
p87
aVI like to smile
p88
aVand say, "Thank you."
p89
aa(lp90
VThursday:
p91
aVConfidence is key.
p92
aVIf you think you look good in something,
p93
aVyou almost certainly do.
p94
aVAnd if you don't think you look good in something,
p95
aVyou're also probably right.
p96
aVI grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
p97
aVBut it wasn't until I turned 30
p98
aVthat I really got what this meant.
p99
aVAnd I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.
p100
aVIf you believe you're a beautiful person
p101
aVinside and out,
p102
aVthere is no look that you can't pull off.
p103
aVSo there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.
p104
aVWe should be able to rock anything we want to rock.
p105
aVThank you.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VFriday: A universal truth \u2014 five words for you:
p110
aVGold sequins go with everything.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd finally, Saturday:
p113
aVDeveloping your own unique personal style
p114
aVis a really great way to tell the world something about you
p115
aVwithout having to say a word.
p116
aVIt's been proven to me time and time again
p117
aVas people have walked up to me this week
p118
aVsimply because of what I'm wearing,
p119
aVand we've had great conversations.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo obviously this is not all going to fit
p122
aVback in my tiny suitcase.
p123
aVSo before I go home to Brooklyn,
p124
aVI'm going to donate everything back.
p125
aVBecause the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week
p126
aVis that it's okay to let go.
p127
aVI don't need to get emotionally attached to these things
p128
aVbecause around the corner,
p129
aVthere is always going to be
p130
aVanother crazy, colorful,
p131
aVshiny outfit
p132
aVjust waiting for me,
p133
aVif I put a little love in my heart and look.
p134
aa(lp135
VThank you very much.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VThank you.
