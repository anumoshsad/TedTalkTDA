VFor some time I have been interested in
p4
aVthe placebo effect,
p5
aVwhich might seem like an odd thing
p6
aVfor a magician to be interested in,
p7
aVunless you think of it in the terms that I do,
p8
aVwhich is, "Something fake
p9
aVis believed in enough by somebody
p10
aVthat it becomes something real."
p11
aVIn other words, sugar pills
p12
aVhave a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,
p13
aVthe placebo effect,
p14
aVjust because the person thinks
p15
aVthat what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical
p16
aVor some sort of a \u2014
p17
aVfor pain management, for example,
p18
aVif they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body
p19
aVcalled the placebo effect.
p20
aVSomething fake becomes
p21
aVsomething real
p22
aVbecause of someone's perception of it.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn order for us to understand each other,
p25
aVI want to start by showing you a rudimentary,
p26
aVvery simple magic trick.
p27
aVAnd I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick
p28
aVthat's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.
p29
aVI learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.
p30
aVI'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
p31
aVAnd then I'll explain why I explained it.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, here's what happens.
p34
aVThe knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.
p35
aVI'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.
p36
aVI'll get my sleeve back.
p37
aVAnd to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve
p38
aVI'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
p39
aVThat way you can see that at no time
p40
aVcan anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there
p41
aVnothing can go up or down my sleeve.
p42
aVAnd the object of this is quite simple.
p43
aVI'm going to open my hand,
p44
aVand hopefully, if all is well,
p45
aVmy pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.
p46
aVIn fact it's held so tightly in place
p47
aVthat I can shake it,
p48
aVand the knife does not come off.
p49
aVNothing goes up or down my sleeve,
p50
aVno trickery. And you can examine everything.
p51
aVTa-da!
p52
aV(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo, this is a trick that I often teach to young children
p55
aVthat are interested in magic, because you can learn
p56
aVa great deal about deception by studying
p57
aVthis very \u2014 even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.
p58
aVProbably many of you in the room know this trick.
p59
aVWhat happens is this.
p60
aVI hold the knife in my hand.
p61
aVI say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist
p62
aVto make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,
p63
aVthat is a lie.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe reason I'm holding onto my wrist
p66
aVis because that's actually the secret
p67
aVof the illusion.
p68
aVIn a moment when my hand moves from facing you
p69
aVto being away from you,
p70
aVthis finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift
p71
aVfrom where it is, to a position
p72
aVpointing out like this.
p73
aVNice one.
p74
aVSomeone who didn't have a childhood is out there.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, it goes like this, from here, right.
p78
aVAnd as I move around my finger shifts.
p79
aVAnd we could talk about why this is deceptive,
p80
aVwhy you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,
p81
aVbecause the mind, and the way it processes information,
p82
aVit doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.
p83
aVBut that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.
p84
aVObviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,
p85
aVbut by chicanery,
p86
aVmy index finger being there.
p87
aVAnd then when I close my finger, same thing,
p88
aVas I move back, this motion
p89
aVkind of covers the moving back of my finger.
p90
aVI take this hand away. You give the knife out.
p91
aVThere is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, (Laughter)
p94
aVwhat does that have to do with the placebo effect?
p95
aVI read a study a year or so ago
p96
aVthat really blew my mind wide open.
p97
aVI'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,
p98
aVwas an astonishing thing.
p99
aVIt turns out that if you administer
p100
aVa placebo in the form of a white pill,
p101
aVthat's like aspirin shaped \u2014
p102
aVit's just a round white pill \u2014 it has some certain measurable effect.
p103
aVBut if you change the form that you give the placebo in,
p104
aVlike you make a smaller pill,
p105
aVand color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,
p106
aVit is actually measurably more effective.
p107
aVEven though neither one of these things
p108
aVhas any pharmaceutical \u2014 they're sugar pills.
p109
aVBut a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
p110
aVWhat? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.
p111
aa(lp112
VTurns out though, that that's not even where it stops.
p113
aVIf you have capsules,
p114
aVthey're more effective than tablets in any form.
p115
aVA colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other
p116
aVis better than a white capsule.
p117
aVDosage has something to do with this.
p118
aVOne pill twice a day
p119
aVis not as good at three pills \u2014
p120
aVI don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.
p121
aVBut the point is ...
p122
aV(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.
p123
aVAnd the form has something to do with it.
p124
aVAnd if you want the ultimate in placebo,
p125
aVyou've go to the needle.
p126
aVRight? A syringe with some inert \u2014
p127
aVa couple CCs of some inert something,
p128
aVand you inject this into a patient ...
p129
aVWell this is such a powerful image in their mind,
p130
aVit's so much stronger than the white pill.
p131
aa(lp132
VIt's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you
p133
aVsome other time when we have slides.
p134
aVThe point is
p135
aVthe white pill is not as good as the blue pill
p136
aVis not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.
p137
aVAnd none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,
p138
aVit's only your belief that makes it real
p139
aVin your body and makes a stronger effect.
p140
aVI wanted to see if I could take that idea
p141
aVand apply it to a magic trick.
p142
aVAnd take something that is obviously a fake trick
p143
aVand make it seem real.
p144
aVAnd we know from that study
p145
aVthat when you want reality, you go to the needle.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,
p148
aVand I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.
p149
aVThis is really my flesh. This is not
p150
aVDamian's special-grown flesh.
p151
aVThat's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.
p152
aVI'm going to pierce my skin
p153
aVand run this needle through to the other side.
p154
aa(lp155
VIf you're queasy \u2014 (Laughs)
p156
aVif you faint easily \u2014 I was doing this for some friends
p157
aVin the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,
p158
aVand one woman almost passed out.
p159
aVSo, I suggest if you get queasy easy
p160
aVthat you look away for about the next 30 \u2014
p161
aVin fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.
p162
aVYou'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, here is what happens, right here,
p165
aVthe beginning of my flesh
p166
aVat the lower part of my arm I just make
p167
aVa little pierce.
p168
aVI'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?
p169
aVOK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,
p170
aVand then out the other side like this.
p171
aVNow, essentially we're in the same position we were in
p172
aVwith the knife trick.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVSort of.
p175
aVBut you can't count my fingers right now can you?
p176
aVSo, let me show them to you. That's one, two
p177
aVthree, four, five.
p178
aVYes, well...
p179
aa(lp180
VI know what people think when they see this.
p181
aVThey go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough
p182
aVto stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.
p183
aVSo, let me give you a little peek.
p184
aVHow's that look out there? Pretty good.
p185
aV(Laughs)
p186
aVYeah, I know. (Laughs)
p187
aVAnd the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."
p188
aVPeople in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
p189
aVLet me give you good close look at this.
p190
aVThat really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.
p191
aVThat's my flesh, and I can twist that around.
p192
aVI'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,
p193
aVdon't look at the thing.
p194
aa(lp195
VPeople in the back or people on video years from now watching this
p196
aVwill go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat
p197
aVin some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be \u2014
p198
aVsee there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.
p199
aVWell let me work up some blood for you.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVYes, there it is.
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VNormally now, I would take the needle out.
p206
aVI would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.
p207
aVBut I think in this context
p208
aVand with the idea of taking something fake
p209
aVand making it into something real,
p210
aVI'm just going to leave it there,
p211
aVand walk off the stage.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVI will be seeing you several times over the next few days.
p214
aVI hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.
