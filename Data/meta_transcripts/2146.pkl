VWhen I arrived in Kiev,
p4
aVon February 1 this year,
p5
aVIndependence Square was under siege,
p6
aVsurrounded by police loyal to the government.
p7
aVThe protesters who occupied Maidan,
p8
aVas the square is known,
p9
aVprepared for battle,
p10
aVstockpiling homemade weapons
p11
aVand mass-producing improvised body armor.
p12
aVThe Euromaidan protests began peacefully at the end of 2013,
p13
aVafter the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych,
p14
aVrejected a far-reaching accord with the European Union
p15
aVin favor of stronger ties with Russia.
p16
aVIn response, tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens
p17
aVpoured into central Kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance.
p18
aa(lp19
VAs the months passed,
p20
aVconfrontations between police and civilians intensified.
p21
aVI set up a makeshift portrait studio by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.
p22
aVThere, I photographed the fighters against a black curtain,
p23
aVa curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop
p24
aVof fire, ice and smoke.
p25
aVIn order to tell the individual human stories here,
p26
aVI felt that I needed to remove the dramatic visuals
p27
aVthat had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media.
p28
aVWhat I was witnessing was not only news, but also history.
p29
aVWith this realization,
p30
aVI was free from the photojournalistic conventions
p31
aVof the newspaper and the magazine.
p32
aVOleg, Vasiliy and Maxim were all ordinary men,
p33
aVwith ordinary lives from ordinary towns.
p34
aVBut the elaborate costumes that they had bedecked themselves in
p35
aVwere quite extraordinary.
p36
aVI say the word "costume"
p37
aVbecause these were not clothes that had been issued
p38
aVor coordinated by anyone.
p39
aVThey were improvised uniforms
p40
aVmade up of decommissioned military equipment,
p41
aVirregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police.
p42
aVI became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves,
p43
aVthis outward expression of masculinity,
p44
aVthe ideal of the warrior.
p45
aa(lp46
VI worked slowly, using an analog film camera
p47
aVwith a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter.
p48
aVThe process is old-fashioned.
p49
aVIt gives me time to speak with each person
p50
aVand to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.
p51
aa(lp52
VRising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence
p53
aVon February 20,
p54
aVwhich became known as Bloody Thursday.
p55
aVSnipers, loyal to the government,
p56
aVstarted firing on the civilians and protesters on Institutskaya Street.
p57
aVMany were killed in a very short space of time.
p58
aVThe reception of the Hotel Ukraine became a makeshift morgue.
p59
aVThere were lines of bodies laid in the street.
p60
aVAnd there was blood all over the pavements.
p61
aVThe following day, President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.
p62
aVIn all, three months of protests
p63
aVresulted in more than 120 confirmed dead
p64
aVand many more missing.
p65
aVHistory unfolded quickly,
p66
aVbut celebration remained elusive in Maidan.
p67
aa(lp68
VAs the days passed in Kiev's central square,
p69
aVstreams of armed fighters
p70
aVwere joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people,
p71
aVfilling the streets in an act of collective mourning.
p72
aVMany were women who often carried flowers
p73
aVthat they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead.
p74
aVThey came day after day
p75
aVand they covered the square with millions of flowers.
p76
aVSadness enveloped Maidan.
p77
aVIt was quiet and I could hear the birds singing.
p78
aVI hadn't heard that before.
p79
aa(lp80
VI stopped women as they approached the barricades
p81
aVto lay their tributes
p82
aVand asked to make their picture.
p83
aVMost women cried when I photographed them.
p84
aVOn the first day, my fixer, Emine, and I cried
p85
aVwith almost every woman who visited our studio.
p86
aVThere had been such a noticeable absence of women
p87
aVup until that point.
p88
aVAnd the color of their pastel coats,
p89
aVtheir shiny handbags,
p90
aVand the bunches of red carnations,
p91
aVwhite tulips and yellow roses that they carried
p92
aVjarred with the blackened square
p93
aVand the blackened men who were encamped there.
p94
aa(lp95
VIt is clear to me that these two sets of pictures
p96
aVdon't make much sense without the other.
p97
aVThey are about men and women and the way we are \u2014
p98
aVnot the way we look, but the way we are.
p99
aVThey speak about different gender roles in conflict,
p100
aVnot only in Maidan, and not only in Ukraine.
p101
aVMen fight most wars and women mourn them.
p102
aVIf the men showed the ideal of the warrior,
p103
aVthen the women showed the implications of such violence.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhen I made these pictures,
p106
aVI believed that I was documenting the end of violent events in Ukraine.
p107
aVBut now I understand that it is a record of the beginning.
p108
aVToday, the death toll stands around 3,000,
p109
aVwhile hundreds of thousands have been displaced.
p110
aVI was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.
p111
aVIn Maidan, the barricades have been dismantled,
p112
aVand the paving stones which were used as weapons during the protests replaced,
p113
aVso that traffic flows freely through the center of the square.
p114
aVThe fighters, the women and the flowers are gone.
p115
aVA huge billboard depicting geese flying over a wheat field
p116
aVcovers the burned-out shell of the trade union's building
p117
aVand proclaims,
p118
aV"Glory to Ukraine.
p119
aVGlory to heroes."
p120
aVThank you.
p121
aV(Applause).
