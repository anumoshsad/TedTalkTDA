VThroughout the history of computers
p4
aVwe've been striving to shorten the gap between us
p5
aVand digital information,
p6
aVthe gap between our physical world
p7
aVand the world in the screen
p8
aVwhere our imagination can go wild.
p9
aVAnd this gap has become shorter,
p10
aVshorter, and even shorter,
p11
aVand now this gap is shortened down
p12
aVto less than a millimeter,
p13
aVthe thickness of a touch-screen glass,
p14
aVand the power of computing
p15
aVhas become accessible to everyone.
p16
aVBut I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
p17
aVI started to imagine what this would look like.
p18
aVFirst, I created this tool
p19
aVwhich penetrates into the digital space,
p20
aVso when you press it hard on the screen,
p21
aVit transfers its physical body into pixels.
p22
aVDesigners can materialize their ideas
p23
aVdirectly in 3D,
p24
aVand surgeons can practice on virtual organs
p25
aVunderneath the screen.
p26
aVSo with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
p27
aVBut our two hands still remain outside the screen.
p28
aVHow can you reach inside and interact
p29
aVwith the digital information
p30
aVusing the full dexterity of our hands?
p31
aVAt Microsoft Applied Sciences,
p32
aValong with my mentor Cati Boulanger,
p33
aVI redesigned the computer
p34
aVand turned a little space above the keyboard
p35
aVinto a digital workspace.
p36
aVBy combining a transparent display and depth cameras
p37
aVfor sensing your fingers and face,
p38
aVnow you can lift up your hands from the keyboard
p39
aVand reach inside this 3D space
p40
aVand grab pixels with your bare hands.
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aVBecause windows and files have a position in the real space,
p43
aVselecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
p44
aVThen you can flip through this book
p45
aVwhile highlighting the lines, words
p46
aVon the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
p47
aVArchitects can stretch or rotate the models
p48
aVwith their two hands directly.
p49
aVSo in these examples,
p50
aVwe are reaching into the digital world.
p51
aVBut how about reversing its role
p52
aVand having the digital information reach us instead?
p53
aVI'm sure many of us have had the experience
p54
aVof buying and returning items online.
p55
aVBut now you don't have to worry about it.
p56
aVWhat I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
p57
aVThis is a view that you get from
p58
aVhead-mounted or see-through display
p59
aVwhen the system understands the geometry of your body.
p60
aVTaking this idea further, I started to think,
p61
aVinstead of just seeing these pixels in our space,
p62
aVhow can we make it physical
p63
aVso that we can touch and feel it?
p64
aVWhat would such a future look like?
p65
aVAt MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii
p66
aVand my collaborator Rehmi Post,
p67
aVwe created this one physical pixel.
p68
aVWell, in this case, this spherical magnet
p69
aVacts like a 3D pixel in our space,
p70
aVwhich means that both computers and people
p71
aVcan move this object to anywhere
p72
aVwithin this little 3D space.
p73
aVWhat we did was essentially canceling gravity
p74
aVand controlling the movement by combining
p75
aVmagnetic levitation and mechanical actuation
p76
aVand sensing technologies.
p77
aVAnd by digitally programming the object,
p78
aVwe are liberating the object from constraints
p79
aVof time and space, which means that now,
p80
aVhuman motions can be recorded and played back
p81
aVand left permanently in the physical world.
p82
aVSo choreography can be taught physically over distance
p83
aVand Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated
p84
aVover and over as a physical reality.
p85
aVStudents can use this as a tool
p86
aVto learn about the complex concepts
p87
aVsuch as planetary motion, physics,
p88
aVand unlike computer screens or textbooks,
p89
aVthis is a real, tangible experience
p90
aVthat you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
p91
aVAnd what's more exciting
p92
aVthan just turning what's currently in the computer physical
p93
aVis to start imagining how programming the world
p94
aVwill alter even our daily physical activities.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVAs you can see, the digital information
p97
aVwill not just show us something
p98
aVbut it will start directly acting upon us
p99
aVas a part of our physical surroundings
p100
aVwithout disconnecting ourselves from our world.
p101
aVToday, we started by talking about the boundary,
p102
aVbut if we remove this boundary,
p103
aVthe only boundary left is our imagination.
p104
aVThank you.
