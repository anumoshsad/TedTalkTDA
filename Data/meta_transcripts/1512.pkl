(lp3
VWell, I was born with a rare visual condition
p4
aVcalled achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,
p5
aVso I've never seen color,
p6
aVand I don't know what color looks like,
p7
aVbecause I come from a grayscale world.
p8
aVTo me, the sky is always gray,
p9
aVflowers are always gray,
p10
aVand television is still in black and white.
p11
aa(lp12
VBut, since the age of 21,
p13
aVinstead of seeing color, I can hear color.
p14
aVIn 2003, I started a project
p15
aVwith computer scientist Adam Montandon,
p16
aVand the result, with further collaborations
p17
aVwith Peter Kese from Slovenia
p18
aVand Matias Lizana from Barcelona,
p19
aVis this electronic eye.
p20
aVIt's a color sensor that detects
p21
aVthe color frequency in front of me \u2014 (Frequency sounds) \u2014
p22
aVand sends this frequency to a chip installed
p23
aVat the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me
p24
aVthrough the bone, through bone conduction.
p25
aV(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like \u2014
p26
aVThis is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)
p27
aVFor example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)
p28
aVThis is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)
p29
aVThis is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)
p30
aVWhich is like yellow, this one.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,
p33
aVsince 2004, so I find it completely normal now
p34
aVto hear color all the time.
p35
aVAt the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give
p36
aVfor each color, so I had to memorize the notes,
p37
aVbut after some time, all this information
p38
aVbecame a perception.
p39
aVI didn't have to think about the notes.
p40
aVAnd after some time, this perception became a feeling.
p41
aVI started to have favorite colors,
p42
aVand I started to dream in colors.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, when I started to dream in color is when I felt
p45
aVthat the software and my brain had united,
p46
aVbecause in my dreams, it was my brain creating
p47
aVelectronic sounds. It wasn't the software,
p48
aVso that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.
p49
aVIt's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device
p50
aVwas no longer a device.
p51
aVIt had become a part of my body,
p52
aVan extension of my senses,
p53
aVand after some time, it even became a part
p54
aVof my official image.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis is my passport from 2004.
p57
aVYou're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports
p58
aVwith electronic equipment, but I insisted
p59
aVto the passport office that what they were seeing
p60
aVwas actually a new part of my body,
p61
aVan extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me
p62
aVto appear with the passport photo.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,
p65
aVbecause color is almost everywhere,
p66
aVso the biggest change for example is
p67
aVgoing to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,
p68
aVfor example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,
p69
aVbecause I can listen to the paintings.
p70
aVAnd supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,
p71
aVit's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.
p72
aVIt's like going to a nightclub.
p73
aVIt's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.
p74
aVEspecially the aisle with cleaning products.
p75
aVIt's just fabulous. (Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VAlso, the way I dress has changed.
p78
aVBefore, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
p79
aVNow I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VSo today I'm dressed in C major,
p84
aVso it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)
p85
aVIf I had to go to a funeral, though,
p86
aVI would dress in B minor, which would be
p87
aVturquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VAlso, food, the way I look at food has changed,
p90
aVbecause now I can display the food on a plate,
p91
aVso I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)
p92
aVSo depending on how I display it,
p93
aVI can hear and I can compose music with food.
p94
aVSo imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,
p95
aVLady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,
p96
aVthis would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.
p97
aVAnd also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos
p98
aVas main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,
p99
aVthat would be a very exciting restaurant
p100
aVwhere you can actually eat songs.
p101
aa(lp102
VAlso, the way I perceive beauty has changed,
p103
aVbecause when I look at someone, I hear their face,
p104
aVso someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.
p105
aV(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,
p106
aVthe other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,
p107
aVsound portraits of people.
p108
aVInstead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,
p109
aVI point at them with the eye and I write down
p110
aVthe different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.
p111
aVHere's some faces.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Musical chords)
p114
aa(lp115
VYeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VSome people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.
p118
aVPrince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.
p119
aVThey have similar sound of eyes.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo you relate people that you wouldn't relate,
p122
aVand you can actually also create concerts
p123
aVby looking at the audience faces.
p124
aVSo I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.
p125
aVThe good thing about this is,
p126
aVif the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
p127
aVIt's not my fault, because \u2014 (Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so another thing that happens is that
p130
aVI started having this secondary effect
p131
aVthat normal sounds started to become color.
p132
aVI heard a telephone tone, and it felt green
p133
aVbecause it sounded just like the color green.
p134
aVThe BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,
p135
aVand listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,
p136
aa(lp137
Vso I started to paint music and paint people's voices,
p138
aVbecause people's voices have frequencies
p139
aVthat I relate to color.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd here's some music translated into color.
p142
aVFor example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.
p143
aV(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,
p144
aVbecause there's many different frequencies.
p145
aV(Music)
p146
aVAnd this is a completely different song.
p147
aV(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)
p148
aV(Music)
p149
aVIt is very pink and very yellow.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,
p152
aVfor example, these are two very well-known speeches.
p153
aVOne of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"
p154
aVand the other one is Hitler.
p155
aVAnd I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls
p156
aVwithout labels, and then I ask people,
p157
aV"Which one do you prefer?"
p158
aVAnd most people change their preference
p159
aVwhen I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler
p160
aVand the one on the right is Martin Luther King.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,
p163
aVjust like human vision.
p164
aVI was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
p165
aVBut then, I just thought that
p166
aVthis human vision wasn't good enough.
p167
aVThere's many, many more colors around us
p168
aVthat we cannot perceive,
p169
aVbut that electronic eyes can perceive.
p170
aVSo I decided to continue extending my color senses,
p171
aVand I added infrared and I added ultraviolet
p172
aVto the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors
p173
aVthat the human eye cannot perceive.
p174
aa(lp175
VFor example, perceiving infrared is good because you can
p176
aVactually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.
p177
aVI can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.
p178
aVAnd the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that
p179
aVyou can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,
p180
aVbecause ultraviolet is a dangerous color,
p181
aVa color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish
p182
aVto perceive things that we cannot perceive.
p183
aa(lp184
VThat's why, two years ago,
p185
aVI created the Cyborg Foundation,
p186
aVwhich is a foundation that tries to help people
p187
aVbecome a cyborg, tries to encourage people
p188
aVto extend their senses
p189
aVby using technology as part of the body.
p190
aa(lp191
VWe should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,
p192
aVso if we extend our senses,
p193
aVwe will consequently extend our knowledge.
p194
aVI think life will be much more exciting
p195
aVwhen we stop creating applications for mobile phones
p196
aVand we start creating applications for our own body.
p197
aVI think this will be a big, big change
p198
aVthat we will see during this century.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo I do encourage you all to think about which senses
p201
aVyou'd like to extend.
p202
aVI would encourage you to become a cyborg.
p203
aVYou won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)
