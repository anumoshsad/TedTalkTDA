VMy name is Harry Baker. Harry Baker is my name.
p4
aVIf your name was Harry Baker, then our names would be the same.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VIt's a short introductory part.
p8
aa(lp9
VYeah, I'm Harry.
p10
aVI study maths. I write poetry.
p11
aVSo I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is called "59."
p15
aVI was going to call it "Prime Time Loving."
p16
aVThat reaction is why I didn't.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, "59."
p20
aa(lp21
V59 wakes up on the wrong  side of the bed.
p22
aa(lp23
VRealizes all his hair is  on one side of his head.
p24
aa(lp25
VTakes just under a minute to work out that it\u2019s because of the way that he slept.
p26
aa(lp27
VHe finds some clothes and gets dressed.
p28
aa(lp29
VHe can\u2019t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed
p30
aa(lp31
VHow he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd as he glances out the window, he sees the sight that he gets blessed with
p34
aVof 60 from across the street.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow 60 was beautiful.
p37
aa(lp38
VWith perfectly trimmed cuticles, dressed in something suitable.
p39
aa(lp40
VNever rude or crude at all.
p41
aa(lp42
VUnimprovable, right on time as usual, more on cue than a snooker ball
p43
aVbut liked to play it super cool.
p44
aa(lp45
V59 wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower.
p46
aa(lp47
VHe thought of her every second, every minute, every hour.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut he knew it wouldn\u2019t work, he\u2019d never get the girl.
p50
aa(lp51
VBecause although she lived  across the street
p52
aVthey came from different worlds.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhile 59 admired 60\u2019s perfectly round figure,
p55
aV60 thought 59 was odd. (Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VOne of his favorite films was "101 Dalmatians."
p58
aa(lp59
VShe preferred the sequel.
p60
aa(lp61
VHe romanticized the idea they were star-crossed lovers.
p62
aa(lp63
VThey could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhile she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother
p66
aa(lp67
VThat separate could not be equal.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd though at the time he felt stupid and dumb
p70
aa(lp71
VFor trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum,
p72
aa(lp73
VHe should have been comforted by the simple sum.
p74
aa(lp75
VTake 59 away from 60, and you\u2019re left with the one.
p76
aa(lp77
VSure enough after two months of moping around,
p78
aa(lp79
V61 days later, 61 was who he found,
p80
aa(lp81
VHe had lost his keys  and his parents were out.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo one day after school  he went into a house
p84
aa(lp85
VAs he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door,
p86
aa(lp87
VHe wondered why he\u2019d never introduced himself before,
p88
aa(lp89
VAs she let him in, his jaw  dropped in awe.
p90
aa(lp91
V61 was like 60, but a little bit more. (Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VShe had prettier eyes, and an approachable smile,
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd like him, rough around the edges, casual style,
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd like him, everything was in disorganized piles,
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd like him, her mum didn\u2019t mind if friends stayed a while.
p100
aa(lp101
VBecause she was like him,  and he liked her.
p102
aa(lp103
VHe reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her,
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked,
p106
aa(lp107
VSo he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits.
p108
aa(lp109
VShe said, "I'm 61." He grinned, said, "I'm 59."
p110
aa(lp111
VToday I\u2019ve had a really nice time,
p112
aa(lp113
VSo tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine?
p114
aa(lp115
VShe said, "Sure."
p116
aa(lp117
VShe loved talking to someone  just as quirky,
p118
aa(lp119
VShe agreed to this unofficial first date.
p120
aa(lp121
VIn the end he was only ready one minute early,
p122
aa(lp123
VBut it didn\u2019t matter because she arrived one minute late.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd from that moment on there was nonstop chatter,
p126
aa(lp127
VHow they loved "X Factor," how they had two factors,
p128
aa(lp129
VHow that did not matter, distinctiveness made them better,
p130
aa(lp131
VBy the end of the night they knew they were meant together.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd one day she was talking about stuck-up 60,
p134
aa(lp135
VShe noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.
p136
aa(lp137
VHe blushed, told her of his crush:
p138
aa(lp139
V\u201cThe best thing that never happened because it led to us.\u201d
p140
aa(lp141
V61 was clever, see, not prone to jealousy,
p142
aa(lp143
VShe looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly,
p144
aa(lp145
V"You\u2019re 59, I\u2019m 61, together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be."
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VAt this point 59 had tears in his eyes,
p149
aa(lp150
VWas so glad to have this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.
p151
aa(lp152
VHe told her the very definition of being prime
p153
aa(lp154
VWas that with only one and himself could his heart divide,
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd she was the one he wanted to give his heart to,
p157
aa(lp158
VShe said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true.
p159
aa(lp160
VBecause that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample,
p161
aa(lp162
VWhen it came to real love, they were a prime example.
p163
aa(lp164
VCheers.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VThat was the first poem that I wrote
p169
aVand it was for a prime number-themed  poetry night \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p170
aVwhich turned out to be a prime number-themed poetry competition.
p171
aVAnd I became a prime number-themed poetry competition winner,
p172
aVor as I like to call it, a prime minister. (Laughter)
p173
aVAnd this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams,
p174
aVand if you don't know what  a poetry slam is,
p175
aVit was a format come up with in America 30 years ago
p176
aVas a way of tricking people into going to poetry events
p177
aVby putting an exciting word like "slam" on the end.
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd each performer got three minutes to perform
p181
aVand then random audience members would hold up scorecards,
p182
aVand they would end up with a numerical score,
p183
aVand what this meant is,
p184
aVit kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience
p185
aVand encouraged the kind of connection with the listener.
p186
aVAnd what it also means is you can win.
p187
aVAnd if you win a poetry slam, you can call yourself a slam champion
p188
aVand pretend you're a wrestler,
p189
aVand if you lose a poetry slam you can say, "Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,
p190
aVyou can't put numbers on such things."
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VBut I loved it, and I got involved in these slams,
p194
aVand I became the U.K. slam champion
p195
aVand got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris,
p196
aVwhich was unbelievable.
p197
aVIt was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages
p198
aVto be judged by five French strangers.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVAnd somehow, I won, which was great,
p201
aVand I've been able to travel the world since doing it,
p202
aVbut it also means that this next piece
p203
aVis technically the best poem in the world.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVSo...
p206
aV(Applause)
p207
aVAccording to five French strangers.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo this is "Paper People."
p210
aa(lp211
VI like people.
p212
aa(lp213
VI'd like some paper people.
p214
aa(lp215
VThey\u2019d be purple paper people. Maybe pop-up purple paper people.
p216
aa(lp217
VProper pop-up purple paper people.
p218
aa(lp219
V"How do you prop up pop-up purple paper people?"
p220
aa(lp221
VI hear you cry. Well I ...
p222
aa(lp223
VI\u2019d probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people
p224
aa(lp225
Vwith a proper pop-up purple people paperclip,
p226
aa(lp227
Vbut I\u2019d pre-prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives,
p228
aa(lp229
Va cheeky pack of Blu Tack just in case the paper slipped.
p230
aa(lp231
VBecause I could build a pop-up metropolis.
p232
aa(lp233
Vbut I wouldn\u2019t wanna deal with all the paper people politics.
p234
aa(lp235
Vpaper politicians with their paper-thin policies,
p236
aa(lp237
Vbroken promises without appropriate apologies.
p238
aa(lp239
VThere\u2019d be a little paper me. And a little paper you.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay-per-view.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VWe\u2019d see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package
p245
aa(lp246
Vor watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.
p247
aV(Laughter) Paper.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere\u2019d be a paper princess Kate but we\u2019d all stare at paper Pippa,
p250
aa(lp251
Vand then we\u2019d all live in fear of killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,
p252
aa(lp253
Vbecause the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices,
p254
aa(lp255
Vpapers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists.
p256
aa(lp257
VA little paper me. And a little paper you.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd in a pop-up population people\u2019s problems pop up too.
p260
aa(lp261
VThere\u2019d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch,
p262
aa(lp263
Vand who ignored the people's protests about all the paper cuts,
p264
aa(lp265
Vthen the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces,
p266
aa(lp267
Vby the confetti cannons manned by pre-emptive police.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd yes there\u2019d still be paper money, so there\u2019d still be paper greed,
p270
aa(lp271
Vand the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need,
p272
aa(lp273
Vpurchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties,
p274
aa(lp275
Vothers live in poverty and ain\u2019t acknowledged properly.
p276
aa(lp277
VA proper poor economy where so many are proper poor,
p278
aa(lp279
Vbut while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars.
p280
aa(lp281
VOrigami armies unfold plans for paper planes
p282
aa(lp283
Vand we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains,
p284
aa(lp285
Vbut the greater shame is that it always seems to stay the same,
p286
aa(lp287
Vwhat changes is who\u2019s in power choosing how to lay the blame,
p288
aa(lp289
Vthey\u2019re naming names, forgetting these are names of people,
p290
aa(lp291
Vbecause in the end it all comes down to people.
p292
aa(lp293
VI like people.
p294
aa(lp295
V'Cause even when the situation\u2019s dire,
p296
aa(lp297
Vit is only ever people who are able to inspire,
p298
aa(lp299
Vand on paper, it\u2019s hard to see how we all cope.
p300
aa(lp301
VBut in the bottom of Pandora\u2019s box there\u2019s still hope,
p302
aa(lp303
Vand I still hope 'cause I believe in people.
p304
aa(lp305
VPeople like my grandparents.
p306
aa(lp307
VWho every single day since I was born,
p308
aVhave taken time out of their morning to pray for me.
p309
aa(lp310
VThat\u2019s 7892 days straight of someone checking I\u2019m okay,
p311
aVand that\u2019s amazing.
p312
aa(lp313
VPeople like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.
p314
aa(lp315
VPeople who are capable of genuine forgiveness.
p316
aa(lp317
VPeople like the persecuted Palestinians.
p318
aa(lp319
VPeople who go out of their way to make your life better,
p320
aVand expect nothing in return.
p321
aa(lp322
VYou see, people have potential to be powerful.
p323
aa(lp324
VJust because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims
p325
aa(lp326
Vwe don\u2019t need to succumb to that system.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd a paper population is no different.
p329
aa(lp330
VThere\u2019s a little paper me. And a little paper you.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd in a pop-up population people's problems pop up too,
p333
aa(lp334
Vbut even if the whole world fell apart then we\u2019d still make it through.
p335
aa(lp336
VBecause we\u2019re people.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Applause)
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you very much. I've just got time for one more.
p343
aa(lp344
VFor me, poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers.
p345
aVWhen I first started,
p346
aVthe people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories,
p347
aVand I thought, as an 18-year-old with a happy life, it was too normal,
p348
aVbut I could create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences
p349
aVand dreams and beliefs.
p350
aVSo it's amazing to be here in front of you today.
p351
aVThank you for being here.
p352
aVIf you weren't here,
p353
aVit would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVAnd this is more fun.
p356
aa(lp357
VSo this last one is called "The Sunshine Kid."
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you very much for listening.
p360
aa(lp361
VOld man sunshine was proud of his sun,
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd it brightened his day to see his little boy run,
p364
aa(lp365
VNot because of what he\u2019d done, nor the problems overcome,
p366
aa(lp367
VBut that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one.
p368
aa(lp369
VIt hadn\u2019t always been like this.
p370
aa(lp371
VThere\u2019d been times when he\u2019d tried to hide his brightness,
p372
aa(lp373
VYou see, every star hits periods of hardship,
p374
aa(lp375
VIt takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness.
p376
aa(lp377
VIf we go back to when he was born in a nebula,
p378
aa(lp379
VWe know that he never was thought of as regular,
p380
aa(lp381
VBecause he had a flair about him,
p382
aa(lp383
VTo say the Midas touch is wrong
p384
aa(lp385
VBut all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze,
p386
aa(lp387
VYes this sun was loved by some more than others,
p388
aa(lp389
VIt was a case of Joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers
p390
aa(lp391
VBecause standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons,
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd jealousy created enemies in those he outshone
p394
aa(lp395
VSuch as the Shadow People.
p396
aa(lp397
VNow the Shadow People didn\u2019t like the Sunshine Kid,
p398
aa(lp399
VBecause he showed up the dark things the Shadow People did,
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd when he shone he showed the places where the Shadow People hid,
p402
aa(lp403
VSo the Shadow People had an evil plan to get rid of him,
p404
aa(lp405
VFirst up \u2014 they made fun of his sunspots,
p406
aa(lp407
VShooting his dreams from the sky, their words were gunshots,
p408
aa(lp409
VDesigned to remind him he wasn\u2019t very cool
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd he didn\u2019t fit in with any popular kids at school.
p412
aa(lp413
VThey said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to Earth,
p414
aa(lp415
VEssentially he came from nothing and that is what he was worth,
p416
aa(lp417
VHe\u2019d never get to go to university to learn,
p418
aa(lp419
VOnly degrees he\u2019d ever show would be the first degree burns
p420
aa(lp421
VFrom those that came too close,
p422
aVthey told him he was too bright,
p423
aa(lp424
VThat\u2019s why no one ever looked him in the eyes,
p425
aa(lp426
VHis judgment became clouded
p427
aa(lp428
VSo did the sky, With evaporated tears
p429
aa(lp430
Vas the sun started to cry.
p431
aa(lp432
VBecause the sunshine kid was bright, with a warm personality,
p433
aa(lp434
VAnd inside he burned savagely
p435
aa(lp436
VHurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk
p437
aa(lp438
Vwho spoke holes in his soul and left cavities,
p439
aa(lp440
VAnd as his heart hardened, his spark darkened,
p441
aa(lp442
VEvery time they called him names it cooled his flames,
p443
aa(lp444
VHe thought they might like him if he kept his light dim
p445
aa(lp446
VBut they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim,
p447
aa(lp448
VHe couldn\u2019t quite get to grips with what they said,
p449
aa(lp450
VSo he let his light be eclipsed by what they said,
p451
aa(lp452
VHe fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,
p453
aa(lp454
VAnd felt like he\u2019d been punched in his solar plexus.
p455
aa(lp456
VBut that\u2019s when Little Miss Sunshine came along
p457
aa(lp458
VSinging her favorite song about how we\u2019re made to be strong,
p459
aa(lp460
VAnd you don\u2019t have to be wrong to belong, Just be true to who you are,
p461
aa(lp462
Vbecause we are all stars at heart.
p463
aa(lp464
VLittle Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,
p465
aa(lp466
VThe kind of girl when you looked at her
p467
aa(lp468
Vyou forgot stuff,
p469
aa(lp470
VBut for him, there was no forgetting her,
p471
aa(lp472
VThe minute he saw her her image burned in his retina,
p473
aa(lp474
VShe was out of this world, and she accepted him,
p475
aa(lp476
VSomething about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him,
p477
aa(lp478
VThings weren\u2019t as dark as they seemed, and he dared to dream,
p479
aa(lp480
VShadows were nowhere to be seen; when she was there he beamed,
p481
aa(lp482
VHis eyes would light up in ways that can\u2019t be faked,
p483
aa(lp484
VWhen she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate,
p485
aa(lp486
VThey gave each other nicknames, they were "cool star" and "fun sun,"
p487
aa(lp488
VAnd gradually the shadowy damage became undone,
p489
aa(lp490
VShe was one in a septillion, and she was brilliant,
p491
aa(lp492
VCould turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion,
p493
aa(lp494
VLoved by billions, from Chileans to Brazilians,
p495
aa(lp496
VAnd taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience.
p497
aa(lp498
VShe said: \u201cAll the darkness in the world
p499
aa(lp500
Vcannot put out the light from a single candle
p501
aa(lp502
VSo how the hell can they handle your light?
p503
aa(lp504
VOnly you can choose to dim it, and the sky is the limit,
p505
aVso silence the critics by burning.\u201d
p506
aa(lp507
VAnd if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains
p508
aa(lp509
VAnd let the sun shine through the hurting.
p510
aa(lp511
VIn a universe of adversity these stars stuck together,
p512
aa(lp513
VAnd though days became nights the memories would last forever,
p514
aa(lp515
VWhether the weatherman said it or not, it would be fine,
p516
aa(lp517
V'Cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine.
p518
aa(lp519
VYes, the Sunshine Kid was bright, with a warm personality,
p520
aa(lp521
VAnd inside he burned savagely,
p522
aa(lp523
VFueled by the fire inspired across galaxies
p524
aa(lp525
VBy the girl who showed him belief.
p526
aa(lp527
VThank you very much.
