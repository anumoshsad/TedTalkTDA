VPenelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.
p4
aVNo, I'm just joking.
p5
aVIt's interesting, because it was six years ago
p6
aVwhen I was pregnant with my first child
p7
aVthat I discovered
p8
aVthat the most commonly used preservative
p9
aVin baby care products
p10
aVmimics estrogen
p11
aVwhen it gets into the human body.
p12
aVNow it's very easy actually
p13
aVto get a chemical compound from products
p14
aVinto the human body through the skin.
p15
aVAnd these preservatives had been found
p16
aVin breast cancer tumors.
p17
aa(lp18
VThat was the start of my journey
p19
aVto make this film, "Toxic Baby."
p20
aVAnd it doesn't take much time
p21
aVto discover some really astonishing statistics
p22
aVwith this issue.
p23
aVOne is that you and I all have
p24
aVbetween 30 to 50,000 chemicals
p25
aVin our bodies
p26
aVthat our grandparents didn't have.
p27
aVAnd many of these chemicals
p28
aVare now linked to the skyrocketing incidents
p29
aVof chronic childhood disease
p30
aVthat we're seeing across industrialized nations.
p31
aVI'll show you some statistics.
p32
aVSo for example, in the United Kingdom,
p33
aVthe incidence of childhood leukemia
p34
aVhas risen by 20 percent just in a generation.
p35
aVVery similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.
p36
aVIn Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.
p37
aVThat's a four-fold increase.
p38
aa(lp39
VAgain, similar story around the world.
p40
aVIn the United States,
p41
aVprobably the most astonishing statistic
p42
aVis a 600 percent increase
p43
aVin autism and autistic spectrum disorders
p44
aVand other learning disabilities.
p45
aVAgain, we're seeing that trend
p46
aVacross Europe, across North America.
p47
aVAnd in Europe,
p48
aVthere's certain parts of Europe,
p49
aVwhere we're seeing a four-fold increase
p50
aVin certain genital birth defects.
p51
aVInterestingly, one of those birth defects
p52
aVhas seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.
p53
aVSo a real skyrocketing
p54
aVof chronic childhood disease
p55
aVthat includes other things
p56
aVlike obesity and juvenile diabetes,
p57
aVpremature puberty.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo it's interesting for me,
p60
aVwhen I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me
p61
aVand talk to an audience about these things,
p62
aVthat probably one of the most important people in the world
p63
aVwho can discuss toxicity in babies
p64
aVis expert in frogs.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VTyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well
p69
aVthat I would be talking about pesticides,
p70
aVthat I'd be talking about public health,
p71
aVbecause, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVFrogs.
p74
aVIn fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue
p75
aVwas sort of a surprise as well
p76
aVwhen I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world
p77
aVand they asked me if I would evaluate
p78
aVhow atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.
p79
aVIt turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product
p80
aVfor the largest chemical company in the world.
p81
aVIt's the number one contaminant
p82
aVof groundwater, drinking water, rain water.
p83
aVIn 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,
p84
aVbut in that same year,
p85
aVthe United States EPA re-registered the compound.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe were a bit surprised when we found out
p88
aVthat when we exposed frogs
p89
aVto very low levels of atrazine \u2014 0.1 parts per billion \u2014
p90
aVthat it produced animals that look like this.
p91
aVThese are the dissected gonads of an animal
p92
aVthat has two testes, two ovaries,
p93
aVanother large testis, more ovaries,
p94
aVwhich is not normal ...
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVeven for amphibians.
p97
aVIn some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog
p98
aVshowed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.
p99
aVAnd you can see these large, yolked-up eggs
p100
aVbursting through the surface of this male's testes.
p101
aVNow my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,
p102
aVthat there's nothing more painful than childbirth \u2014
p103
aVwhich that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that \u2014
p104
aVbut I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle
p105
aVwould probably be somewhere in the top five.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VIn recent studies that we've published,
p110
aVwe've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,
p111
aVsome of the males grow up
p112
aVand completely become females.
p113
aVSo these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.
p114
aVAnd not only do these genetic males mate with other males,
p115
aVthey actually have the capacity to lay eggs
p116
aVeven though they're genetic males.
p117
aVWhat we proposed,
p118
aVand what we've now generated support for,
p119
aVis that what atrazine is doing
p120
aVis wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.
p121
aVNormally the testes should make testosterone,
p122
aVthe male hormone.
p123
aVBut what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,
p124
aVthe machinery if you will, aromatase,
p125
aVthat converts testosterone into estrogen.
p126
aVAnd as a result, these exposed males
p127
aVlose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,
p128
aVand they're subsequently feminized
p129
aVbecause now they're making the female hormone.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow this is what brought me to the human-related issues.
p132
aVBecause it turns out
p133
aVthat the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,
p134
aVis regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.
p135
aVSo when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,
p136
aVaromatase converts androgens into estrogens,
p137
aVand that estrogen turns on or promotes
p138
aVthe growth of that cancer
p139
aVso that it turns into a tumor and spreads.
p140
aVIn fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer
p141
aVthat the latest treatment for breast cancer
p142
aVis a chemical called letrozole,
p143
aVwhich blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,
p144
aVso that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow what's interesting is, of course,
p147
aVthat we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,
p148
aVthe number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite \u2014
p149
aVturns on aromatase, increases estrogen
p150
aVand promotes tumors in rats
p151
aVand is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.
p152
aVWhat's interesting is, in fact,
p153
aVthe same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,
p154
aVthe breast cancer promoter,
p155
aVnow sells us the blocker \u2014 the exact same company.
p156
aVAnd so I find it interesting
p157
aVthat instead of treating this disease
p158
aVby preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,
p159
aVwe simply respond
p160
aVby putting more chemicals into the environment.
p161
aa(lp162
VPJC: So speaking of estrogen,
p163
aVone of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film
p164
aVis something called bisphenol A, BPA,
p165
aVwhich has been in the news recently.
p166
aVIt's a plasticizer.
p167
aVIt's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,
p168
aVwhich is what baby bottles are made out of.
p169
aVAnd what's interesting about BPA
p170
aVis that it's such a potent estrogen
p171
aVthat it was actually once considered for use
p172
aVas a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.
p173
aVAnd there have been many, many, many studies that have shown
p174
aVthat BPA leaches from babies' bottles
p175
aVinto the formula, into the milk,
p176
aVand therefore into the babies.
p177
aVSo we're dosing our babies,
p178
aVour newborns, our infants,
p179
aVwith a synthetic estrogen.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow two weeks ago or so,
p182
aVthe European Union passed a law
p183
aVbanning the use of BPA
p184
aVin babies' bottles and sippy cups.
p185
aVAnd for those of you who are not parents,
p186
aVsippy cups are those little plastic things
p187
aVthat your child graduates to after using bottles.
p188
aVBut just two weeks before that,
p189
aVthe U.S. Senate refused to even debate
p190
aVthe banning of BPA
p191
aVin babies' bottles and sippy cups.
p192
aVSo it really makes you realize
p193
aVthe onus on parents
p194
aVto have to look at this and regulate this and police this
p195
aVin their own lives
p196
aVand how astonishing that is.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles
p199
aVnow proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,
p200
aVit really shows how sometimes
p201
aVit is only a parent's awareness
p202
aVthat stands between chemicals and our children.
p203
aVThe baby bottle scenario proves
p204
aVthat we can prevent unnecessary exposure.
p205
aVHowever, if we parents are unaware,
p206
aVwe are leaving our children
p207
aVto fend for themselves.
p208
aa(lp209
VTH: And what Penelope says here
p210
aVis even more true.
p211
aVFor those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.
p212
aVScientists agree now.
p213
aVWe are losing species from the Earth
p214
aVfaster than the dinosaurs disappeared,
p215
aVand leading that loss are amphibians.
p216
aV80 percent of all amphibians
p217
aVare threatened and in come decline.
p218
aVAnd I believe, many scientists believe
p219
aVthat pesticides are an important part of that decline.
p220
aVIn part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive
p221
aVbecause they don't have protection from contaminants in the water \u2014
p222
aVno eggshells, no membranes
p223
aVand no placenta.
p224
aVIn fact, our invention \u2014 by "our" I mean we mammals \u2014
p225
aVone of our big inventions was the placenta.
p226
aVBut we also start out as aquatic organisms.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut it turns out that this ancient structure
p229
aVthat separates us from other animals, the placenta,
p230
aVcannot evolve or adapt fast enough
p231
aVbecause of the rate that we're generating new chemicals
p232
aVthat it's never seen before.
p233
aVThe evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,
p234
aVshow that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.
p235
aVBecause maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.
p236
aa(lp237
VOf those rats that don't abort,
p238
aVatrazine causes prostate disease
p239
aVin the pups so the sons
p240
aVare born with an old man's disease.
p241
aVOf those that don't abort,
p242
aVatrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development
p243
aVin the exposed daughters in utero,
p244
aVso that their breast don't develop properly.
p245
aVAnd as a result, when those rats grow up,
p246
aVtheir pups experience retarded growth and development
p247
aVbecause they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine
p250
aVthat its grandmother was exposed to.
p251
aVAnd given the life of many of these chemicals,
p252
aVgenerations, years, dozens of years,
p253
aVthat means that we right now
p254
aVare affecting the health
p255
aVof our grandchildren's grandchildren
p256
aVby things that we're putting into the environment today.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd this is not just philosophical, it's already known,
p259
aVthat chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,
p260
aVPCBs, DDT
p261
aVcross the placenta
p262
aVand effectively determine
p263
aVthe likelihood of developing breast cancer
p264
aVand obesity and diabetes
p265
aValready when the baby's in the womb.
p266
aVIn addition to that, after the baby's born,
p267
aVour other unique invention as mammals
p268
aVis that we nourish our offspring after they're born.
p269
aVWe already know that chemicals
p270
aVlike DDT and DES and atrazine
p271
aVcan also pass over into milk,
p272
aVagain, affecting our babies
p273
aVeven after their born.
p274
aa(lp275
VPJC: So when Tyrone tells me
p276
aVthat the placenta is an ancient organ,
p277
aVI'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?
p278
aVHow do you show that?
p279
aVAnd it's interesting when you make a film like this,
p280
aVbecause you're stuck trying to visualize science
p281
aVthat there's no visualization for.
p282
aVAnd I have to take a little bit of artistic license.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Video) (Ringing)
p285
aVOld man: Placenta control.
p286
aVWhat is it?
p287
aVOh what?
p288
aV(Snoring)
p289
aV(Honk)
p290
aVPuffuffuff, what?
p291
aVPerflourooctanoic acid.
p292
aVBlimey.
p293
aVNever heard of it.
p294
aVPJC: And neither had I actually
p295
aVbefore I started making this film.
p296
aVAnd so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta
p297
aVand go into your unborn child,
p298
aVit made me start to think,
p299
aVwhat would my fetus say to me?
p300
aVWhat would our unborn children say to us
p301
aVwhen they have an exposure
p302
aVthat's happening everyday, day after day?
p303
aa(lp304
V(Music)
p305
aa(lp306
V(Video) Child: Today,
p307
aVI had some octyphenols,
p308
aVsome artificial musks
p309
aVand some bisphenol A.
p310
aVHelp me.
p311
aa(lp312
VPJC: It's a very profound notion
p313
aVto know that we as women
p314
aVare at the vanguard of this.
p315
aVThis is our issue,
p316
aVbecause we collect these compounds our entire life
p317
aVand then we end up dumping it and dumping them
p318
aVinto our unborn children.
p319
aVWe are in effect
p320
aVpolluting our children.
p321
aVAnd this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago
p322
aVwhen I found out I was pregnant
p323
aVand the first scan revealed
p324
aVthat my baby had a birth defect
p325
aVassociated with exposure
p326
aVto estrogenic chemicals in the womb
p327
aVand the second scan
p328
aVrevealed no heartbeat.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo my child's death, my baby's death,
p331
aVreally brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.
p332
aVAnd it's sometimes a weird place
p333
aVwhen the communicator becomes part of the story,
p334
aVwhich is not what you originally intend.
p335
aVAnd so when Tyrone talks about
p336
aVthe fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,
p337
aVthis is my contaminated environment.
p338
aVThis is my toxic baby.
p339
aVAnd that's something
p340
aVthat's just profound and sad,
p341
aVbut astonishing
p342
aVbecause so many of us don't actually know this.
p343
aa(lp344
VTH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate
p345
aVfor me to be here at TEDWomen
p346
aVis that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner
p347
aVwhen someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,
p348
aV'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"
p349
aVThe truth is, women,
p350
aVyou've had our back on this issue for a very long time,
p351
aVstarting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"
p352
aVto Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"
p353
aVto Sandra Steingraber's books
p354
aV"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."
p355
aVAnd perhaps it's the connection to our next generation \u2014
p356
aVlike my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago \u2014
p357
aVperhaps it's that connection
p358
aVthat makes women activists
p359
aVin this particular area.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut for the men here, I want to say
p362
aVit's not just women and children that are at risk.
p363
aVAnd the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,
p364
aVthe testes are full of holes and spaces,
p365
aVbecause the hormone imbalance,
p366
aVinstead of allowing sperm to be generated,
p367
aVsuch as in the testis here,
p368
aVthe testicular tubules end up empty
p369
aVand fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.
p370
aVIt's not just my work in amphibians,
p371
aVbut similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,
p372
aVholes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America
p373
aVand in rats, an absence of sperm
p374
aVin the testicular tubules as well.
p375
aVAnd of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,
p376
aVbut just by coincidence,
p377
aVmy colleague has shown
p378
aVthat men who have low sperm count, low semen quality
p379
aVhave significantly more atrazine in their urine.
p380
aa(lp381
VThese are just men who live
p382
aVin an agricultural community.
p383
aVMen who actually work in agriculture
p384
aVhave much higher levels of atrazine.
p385
aVAnd the men who actually apply atrazine
p386
aVhave even more atrazine in their urine,
p387
aVup to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active
p388
aVare present in the urine of these men.
p389
aVOf course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.
p390
aVAnd it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.
p391
aVThey're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,
p392
aVwhich was originally used as a nerve gas.
p393
aVAnd many of these workers
p394
aVhave life expectancies of only 50.
p395
aa(lp396
VIt shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife
p397
aVare also a warning to us,
p398
aVjust like Rachel Carson and others have warned.
p399
aVAs evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,
p400
aVthe agricultural runoff from this crop,
p401
aVwhich goes into these buckets,
p402
aVis the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.
p403
aVNow if I told the men in this village
p404
aVthat the frogs have pour immune function
p405
aVand eggs developing in their testes,
p406
aVthe connection between environmental health and public health
p407
aVwould be clear.
p408
aVYou would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact
p409
aVon the wildlife that lived in it.
p410
aVThe problem is, in my village, Oakland,
p411
aVin most of our villages,
p412
aVwe don't see that connection.
p413
aVWe turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,
p414
aVand we assume that we are masters of our environment,
p415
aVrather than being part of it.
p416
aa(lp417
VPJC: So it doesn't take much to realize
p418
aVthat actually this is an environmental issue.
p419
aVAnd I kept thinking over and over again
p420
aVthis question.
p421
aVWe know so much about global warming and climate change,
p422
aVand yet, we have no concept
p423
aVof what I've been calling internal environmentalism.
p424
aVWe know what we're putting out there,
p425
aVwe have a sense of those repercussions,
p426
aVbut we are so ignorant of this sense
p427
aVof what happens when we put things, or things are put
p428
aVinto our bodies.
p429
aa(lp430
VAnd it's my feeling
p431
aVand it's my urging being here
p432
aVto know that, as we women move forward
p433
aVas the communicators of this,
p434
aVbut also as the ones who carry that burden
p435
aVof carrying the children, bearing the children,
p436
aVwe hold most of the buying power in the household,
p437
aVis that it's going to be us moving forward
p438
aVto carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.
p439
aVAnd my urging is
p440
aVthat when we think about environmental issues
p441
aVthat we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,
p442
aVbut it's also about our children as well.
