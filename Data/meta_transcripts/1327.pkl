VOne of the most common ways of dividing the world
p4
aVis into those who believe
p5
aVand those who don't \u2014
p6
aVinto the religious and the atheists.
p7
aVAnd for the last decade or so,
p8
aVit's been quite clear
p9
aVwhat being an atheist means.
p10
aVThere have been some very vocal atheists
p11
aVwho've pointed out,
p12
aVnot just that religion is wrong,
p13
aVbut that it's ridiculous.
p14
aVThese people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,
p15
aVhave argued \u2014
p16
aVthey've argued that believing in God
p17
aVis akin to believing in fairies
p18
aVand essentially that the whole thing
p19
aVis a childish game.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow I think it's too easy.
p22
aVI think it's too easy
p23
aVto dismiss the whole of religion that way.
p24
aVAnd it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
p25
aVAnd what I'd like to inaugurate today
p26
aVis a new way of being an atheist \u2014
p27
aVif you like, a new version of atheism
p28
aVwe could call Atheism 2.0.
p29
aVNow what is Atheism 2.0?
p30
aVWell it starts from a very basic premise:
p31
aVof course, there's no God.
p32
aVOf course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits
p33
aVor angels, etc.
p34
aVNow let's move on; that's not the end of the story,
p35
aVthat's the very, very beginning.
p36
aa(lp37
VI'm interested in the kind of constituency
p38
aVthat thinks something along these lines:
p39
aVthat thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.
p40
aVI can't believe in the doctrines.
p41
aVI don't think these doctrines are right.
p42
aVBut," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.
p43
aVI really like the art of Mantegna.
p44
aVI really like looking at old churches.
p45
aVI really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."
p46
aVWhatever it may be,
p47
aVyou know the kind of thing I'm talking about \u2014
p48
aVpeople who are attracted to the ritualistic side,
p49
aVthe moralistic, communal side of religion,
p50
aVbut can't bear the doctrine.
p51
aVUntil now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
p52
aVIt's almost as though either you accept the doctrine
p53
aVand then you can have all the nice stuff,
p54
aVor you reject the doctrine and
p55
aVyou're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland
p56
aVunder the guidance of CNN and Walmart.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo that's a sort of tough choice.
p59
aVI don't think we have to make that choice.
p60
aVI think there is an alternative.
p61
aVI think there are ways \u2014
p62
aVand I'm being both very respectful and completely impious \u2014
p63
aVof stealing from religions.
p64
aVIf you don't believe in a religion,
p65
aVthere's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,
p66
aVwith taking out the best sides of religion.
p67
aVAnd for me, atheism 2.0
p68
aVis about both, as I say,
p69
aVa respectful and an impious way
p70
aVof going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"
p71
aVThe secular world is full of holes.
p72
aVWe have secularized badly, I would argue.
p73
aVAnd a thorough study of religion
p74
aVcould give us all sorts of insights
p75
aVinto areas of life that are not going too well.
p76
aVAnd I'd like to run through a few of these today.
p77
aa(lp78
VI'd like to kick off by looking at education.
p79
aVNow education is a field
p80
aVthe secular world really believes in.
p81
aVWhen we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,
p82
aVwe think education; that's where we put a lot of money.
p83
aVEducation is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,
p84
aVit's also going to make us better people.
p85
aVYou know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,
p86
aVthose lyrical claims
p87
aVthat education, the process of education \u2014 particularly higher education \u2014
p88
aVwill make us into nobler and better human beings.
p89
aVThat's a lovely idea.
p90
aVInteresting where it came from.
p91
aa(lp92
VIn the early 19th century,
p93
aVchurch attendance in Western Europe
p94
aVstarted sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.
p95
aVThey asked themselves the following question.
p96
aVThey said, where are people going to find the morality,
p97
aVwhere are they going to find guidance,
p98
aVand where are they going to find sources of consolation?
p99
aVAnd influential voices came up with one answer.
p100
aVThey said culture.
p101
aVIt's to culture that we should look
p102
aVfor guidance, for consolation, for morality.
p103
aVLet's look to the plays of Shakespeare,
p104
aVthe dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.
p105
aVIn there, we'll find a lot of the truths
p106
aVthat we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.
p107
aVNow I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
p108
aVThey wanted to replace scripture with culture.
p109
aVAnd that's a very plausible idea.
p110
aVIt's also an idea that we have forgotten.
p111
aa(lp112
VIf you went to a top university \u2014
p113
aVlet's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge \u2014
p114
aVand you said, "I've come here
p115
aVbecause I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;
p116
aVI want to know how to live,"
p117
aVthey would show you the way to the insane asylum.
p118
aVThis is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning
p119
aVare in the business of.
p120
aVWhy? They don't think we need it.
p121
aVThey don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.
p122
aVThey see us as adults, rational adults.
p123
aVWhat we need is information.
p124
aVWe need data, we don't need help.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow religions start from a very different place indeed.
p127
aVAll religions, all major religions,
p128
aVat various points call us children.
p129
aVAnd like children,
p130
aVthey believe that we are in severe need of assistance.
p131
aVWe're only just holding it together.
p132
aVPerhaps this is just me, maybe you.
p133
aVBut anyway, we're only just holding it together.
p134
aVAnd we need help. Of course, we need help.
p135
aVAnd so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.
p136
aa(lp137
VYou know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,
p138
aVthe greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,
p139
aVwho went up and down this country delivering sermons,
p140
aVadvising people how they could live.
p141
aVHe delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children
p142
aVand children to their parents,
p143
aVthe duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.
p144
aVHe was trying to tell people how they should live
p145
aVthrough the medium of sermons,
p146
aVthe classic medium of delivery of religions.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow we've given up with the idea of sermons.
p149
aVIf you said to a modern liberal individualist,
p150
aV"Hey, how about a sermon?"
p151
aVthey'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.
p152
aVI'm an independent, individual person."
p153
aVWhat's the difference between a sermon
p154
aVand our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?
p155
aVWell a sermon wants to change your life
p156
aVand a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.
p157
aVAnd I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.
p158
aVThe tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,
p159
aVbecause we are in need of guidance,
p160
aVmorality and consolation \u2014
p161
aVand religions know that.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnother point about education:
p164
aVwe tend to believe in the modern secular world
p165
aVthat if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.
p166
aVSit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato
p167
aVat the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,
p168
aVand that lesson will stick with them.
p169
aVReligions go, "Nonsense.
p170
aVYou need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.
p171
aVSo get on your knees and repeat it."
p172
aVThat's what all religions tell us:
p173
aV"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."
p174
aVOtherwise our minds are like sieves.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo religions are cultures of repetition.
p177
aVThey circle the great truths again and again and again.
p178
aVWe associate repetition with boredom.
p179
aV"Give us the new," we're always saying.
p180
aV"The new is better than the old."
p181
aVIf I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.
p182
aVWe're just going to run through all the old ones
p183
aVand watch them five times because they're so true.
p184
aVWe're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times
p185
aVbecause what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.
p186
aVNot so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe other things that religions do
p189
aVis to arrange time.
p190
aVAll the major religions give us calendars.
p191
aVWhat is a calendar?
p192
aVA calendar is a way of making sure that across the year
p193
aVyou will bump into certain very important ideas.
p194
aVIn the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,
p195
aVat the end of March you will think about St. Jerome
p196
aVand his qualities of humility and goodness
p197
aVand his generosity to the poor.
p198
aVYou won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.
p199
aVNow we don't think that way.
p200
aVIn the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.
p201
aVI'll just come across it."
p202
aVNonsense, says the religious world view.
p203
aVReligious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,
p204
aVwe need to synchronize encounters.
p205
aVThis comes across also
p206
aVin the way in which religions set up rituals
p207
aVaround important feelings.
p208
aa(lp209
VTake the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.
p210
aVYou know, when you look at the Moon,
p211
aVyou think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"
p212
aVIt sets things into perspective, etc., etc.
p213
aVWe should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.
p214
aVWhy don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."
p215
aVBut if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,
p216
aVyou will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform
p217
aVand made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,
p218
aVwhere you will be given poems to read
p219
aVin honor of the Moon and the passage of time
p220
aVand the frailty of life that it should remind us of.
p221
aVYou'll be handed rice cakes.
p222
aVAnd the Moon and the reflection on the Moon
p223
aVwill have a secure place in your heart.
p224
aVThat's very good.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe other thing that religions are really aware of
p227
aVis: speak well \u2014
p228
aVI'm not doing a very good job of this here \u2014
p229
aVbut oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.
p230
aVIn the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker
p231
aVand still have a great career.
p232
aVBut the religious world doesn't think that way.
p233
aVWhat you're saying needs to be backed up
p234
aVby a really convincing way of saying it.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church
p237
aVin the American South
p238
aVand you listen to how they talk,
p239
aVmy goodness, they talk well.
p240
aVAfter every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."
p241
aVAt the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,
p242
aVand they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."
p243
aVIf we were doing it like they do it \u2014
p244
aVlet's not do it, but if we were to do it \u2014
p245
aVI would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."
p246
aVAnd you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."
p247
aVAnd at the end of my talk, you would all stand up
p248
aVand you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."
p249
aVAnd we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
p250
aVAll right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VThe other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,
p255
aVwe are also bodies.
p256
aVAnd when they teach us a lesson,
p257
aVthey do it via the body.
p258
aVSo for example,
p259
aVtake the Jewish idea of forgiveness.
p260
aVJews are very interested in forgiveness
p261
aVand how we should start anew and start afresh.
p262
aVThey don't just deliver us sermons on this.
p263
aVThey don't just give us books or words about this.
p264
aVThey tell us to have a bath.
p265
aVSo in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.
p266
aVYou immerse yourself in the water,
p267
aVand a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.
p268
aVWe don't tend to do that.
p269
aVOur ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.
p270
aVReligions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.
p271
aa(lp272
VLet's look at art now.
p273
aVNow art is something that in the secular world,
p274
aVwe think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.
p275
aVA lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.
p276
aVWe sometimes hear it said
p277
aVthat museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.
p278
aVYou've heard that saying.
p279
aVNow I think that the potential is there,
p280
aVbut we've completely let ourselves down.
p281
aVAnd the reason we've let ourselves down
p282
aVis that we're not properly studying
p283
aVhow religions handle art.
p284
aa(lp285
VThe two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world
p286
aVthat inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:
p287
aVThe first idea is that art should be for art's sake \u2014
p288
aVa ridiculous idea \u2014
p289
aVan idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble
p290
aVand should not try to do anything with this troubled world.
p291
aVI couldn't disagree more.
p292
aVThe other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,
p293
aVthat artists shouldn't say what they're up to,
p294
aVbecause if they said it, it might destroy the spell
p295
aVand we might find it too easy.
p296
aVThat's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum \u2014
p297
aVlet's admit it \u2014
p298
aVis, "I don't know what this is about."
p299
aVBut if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.
p300
aVBut that feeling of puzzlement is structural
p301
aVto contemporary art.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow religions have a much saner attitude to art.
p304
aVThey have no trouble telling us what art is about.
p305
aVArt is about two things in all the major faiths.
p306
aVFirstly, it's trying to remind you
p307
aVof what there is to love.
p308
aVAnd secondly, it's trying to remind you
p309
aVof what there is to fear and to hate.
p310
aVAnd that's what art is.
p311
aVArt is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.
p312
aVSo as you walk around a church,
p313
aVor a mosque or a cathedral,
p314
aVwhat you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,
p315
aVthrough your eyes, through your senses,
p316
aVtruths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.
p317
aa(lp318
VEssentially it's propaganda.
p319
aVRembrandt is a propagandist
p320
aVin the Christian view.
p321
aVNow the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
p322
aVWe think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.
p323
aVPropaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.
p324
aVAnd if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.
p325
aa(lp326
VMy view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
p327
aVAnd they should make sure that when you walk into a museum \u2014
p328
aVif I was a museum curator,
p329
aVI would make a room for love, a room for generosity.
p330
aVAll works of art are talking to us about things.
p331
aVAnd if we were able to arrange spaces
p332
aVwhere we could come across works
p333
aVwhere we would be told, use these works of art
p334
aVto cement these ideas in your mind,
p335
aVwe would get a lot more out of art.
p336
aVArt would pick up the duty that it used to have
p337
aVand that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.
p338
aVArt should be one of the tools
p339
aVby which we improve our society.
p340
aVArt should be didactic.
p341
aa(lp342
VLet's think of something else.
p343
aVThe people in the modern world, in the secular world,
p344
aVwho are interested in matters of the spirit,
p345
aVin matters of the mind,
p346
aVin higher soul-like concerns,
p347
aVtend to be isolated individuals.
p348
aVThey're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.
p349
aVAnd they tend to be on their own.
p350
aVThey're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.
p351
aVAnd they get depressed and they get sad on their own.
p352
aVAnd they don't really change much.
p353
aa(lp354
VNow think about religions, think about organized religions.
p355
aVWhat do organized religions do?
p356
aVThey group together, they form institutions.
p357
aVAnd that has all sorts of advantages.
p358
aVFirst of all, scale, might.
p359
aVThe Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year
p360
aVaccording to the Wall Street Journal.
p361
aVThese are massive machines.
p362
aVThey're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,
p363
aVand they're highly disciplined.
p364
aa(lp365
VThese are all very good qualities.
p366
aVWe recognize them in relation to corporations.
p367
aVAnd corporations are very like religions in many ways,
p368
aVexcept they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
p369
aVThey're selling us shoes and cars.
p370
aVWhereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff \u2014
p371
aVthe therapists, the poets \u2014
p372
aVare on their own and they have no power,
p373
aVthey have no might.
p374
aVSo religions are the foremost example
p375
aVof an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.
p376
aVNow we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,
p377
aVbut we can admire the institutional way
p378
aVin which they're doing it.
p379
aa(lp380
VBooks alone, books written by lone individuals,
p381
aVare not going to change anything.
p382
aVWe need to group together.
p383
aVIf you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.
p384
aVAnd that's what religions do.
p385
aVThey are multinational, as I say,
p386
aVthey are branded, they have a clear identity,
p387
aVso they don't get lost in a busy world.
p388
aVThat's something we can learn from.
p389
aa(lp390
VI want to conclude.
p391
aVReally what I want to say
p392
aVis for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,
p393
aVthere is something to learn from the example of religion \u2014
p394
aVeven if you don't believe any of it.
p395
aVIf you're involved in anything that's communal,
p396
aVthat involves lots of people getting together,
p397
aVthere are things for you in religion.
p398
aVIf you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,
p399
aVlook at pilgrimage.
p400
aVLook very closely at pilgrimage.
p401
aVWe haven't begun to scratch the surface
p402
aVof what travel could be
p403
aVbecause we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.
p404
aVIf you're in the art world,
p405
aVlook at the example of what religions are doing with art.
p406
aVAnd if you're an educator in any way,
p407
aVagain, look at how religions are spreading ideas.
p408
aVYou may not agree with the ideas,
p409
aVbut my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.
p410
aa(lp411
VSo really my concluding point
p412
aVis you may not agree with religion,
p413
aVbut at the end of the day,
p414
aVreligions are so subtle, so complicated,
p415
aVso intelligent in many ways
p416
aVthat they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;
p417
aVthey're for all of us.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you very much.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Applause)
p422
aa(lp423
VChris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,
p424
aVbecause you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways
p425
aVto be ridiculed in some quarters.
p426
aa(lp427
VAB: You can get shot by both sides.
p428
aVYou can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,
p429
aVand you can get shot by those who fully believe.
p430
aa(lp431
VCA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.
p432
aa(lp433
VAB: Indeed.
p434
aa(lp435
VCA: But you left out one aspect of religion
p436
aVthat a lot of people might say
p437
aVyour agenda could borrow from,
p438
aVwhich is this sense \u2014
p439
aVthat's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious \u2014
p440
aVof spiritual experience,
p441
aVof some kind of connection
p442
aVwith something that's bigger than you are.
p443
aVIs there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?
p444
aa(lp445
VAB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people
p446
aVwho say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,
p447
aVsomething else?"
p448
aVAnd I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"
p449
aVAnd I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,
p450
aVthat sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,
p451
aVneed to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?
p452
aVScience and just observation
p453
aVgives us that feeling without it,
p454
aVso I don't feel the need.
p455
aVThe universe is large and we are tiny,
p456
aVwithout the need for further religious superstructure.
p457
aVSo one can have so-called spiritual moments
p458
aVwithout belief in the spirit.
p459
aa(lp460
VCA: Actually, let me just ask a question.
p461
aVHow many people here would say
p462
aVthat religion is important to them?
p463
aVIs there an equivalent process
p464
aVby which there's a sort of bridge
p465
aVbetween what you're talking about and what you would say to them?
p466
aa(lp467
VAB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life
p468
aVand these can be plugged.
p469
aVIt's not as though, as I try to suggest,
p470
aVit's not as though either you have religion
p471
aVand then you have to accept all sorts of things,
p472
aVor you don't have religion
p473
aVand then you're cut off from all these very good things.
p474
aVIt's so sad that we constantly say,
p475
aV"I don't believe so I can't have community,
p476
aVso I'm cut off from morality,
p477
aVso I can't go on a pilgrimage."
p478
aVOne wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"
p479
aVAnd that's really the spirit of my talk.
p480
aVThere's so much we can absorb.
p481
aVAtheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.
p482
aa(lp483
VCA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community
p484
aVwho are atheists.
p485
aVBut probably most people in the community
p486
aVcertainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon
p487
aVand want to find the language
p488
aVto have a constructive dialogue
p489
aVand to feel like we can actually talk to each other
p490
aVand at least share some things in common.
p491
aVAre we foolish to be optimistic
p492
aVabout the possibility of a world
p493
aVwhere, instead of religion being the great rallying cry
p494
aVof divide and war,
p495
aVthat there could be bridging?
p496
aa(lp497
VAB: No, we need to be polite about differences.
p498
aVPoliteness is a much-overlooked virtue.
p499
aVIt's seen as hypocrisy.
p500
aVBut we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist
p501
aVand someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"
p502
aVyou politely ignore it.
p503
aVYou move on.
p504
aVBecause you've agreed on 90 percent of things,
p505
aVbecause you have a shared view on so many things,
p506
aVand you politely differ.
p507
aVAnd I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
p508
aVThey've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.
p509
aa(lp510
VCA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing
p511
aVthat's not a religion but something else,
p512
aVdoes it need a leader,
p513
aVand are you volunteering to be the pope?
p514
aa(lp515
V(Laughter)
p516
aa(lp517
VAB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of
p518
aVis individual leaders.
p519
aVIt doesn't need it.
p520
aVWhat I've tried to lay out is a framework
p521
aVand I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.
p522
aVI've sketched a sort of broad framework.
p523
aVBut wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.
p524
aVIf you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.
p525
aVSo it's a wiki project.
p526
aa(lp527
V(Laughter)
