VIt used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new,
p4
aVyou would have to program it.
p5
aVNow, programming, for those of you here that haven't done it yourself,
p6
aVrequires laying out in excruciating detail
p7
aVevery single step that you want the computer to do
p8
aVin order to achieve your goal.
p9
aVNow, if you want to do something that you don't know how to do yourself,
p10
aVthen this is going to be a great challenge.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo this was the challenge faced by this man, Arthur Samuel.
p13
aVIn 1956, he wanted to get this computer
p14
aVto be able to beat him at checkers.
p15
aVHow can you write a program,
p16
aVlay out in excruciating detail, how to be better than you at checkers?
p17
aVSo he came up with an idea:
p18
aVhe had the computer play against itself thousands of times
p19
aVand learn how to play checkers.
p20
aVAnd indeed it worked, and in fact, by 1962,
p21
aVthis computer had beaten the Connecticut state champion.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo Arthur Samuel was the father of machine learning,
p24
aVand I have a great debt to him,
p25
aVbecause I am a machine learning practitioner.
p26
aVI was the president of Kaggle,
p27
aVa community of over 200,000 machine learning practictioners.
p28
aVKaggle puts up competitions
p29
aVto try and get them to solve previously unsolved problems,
p30
aVand it's been successful  hundreds of times.
p31
aVSo from this vantage point, I was able to find out
p32
aVa lot about what machine learning can do in the past, can do today,
p33
aVand what it could do in the future.
p34
aVPerhaps the first big success of  machine learning commercially was Google.
p35
aVGoogle showed that it is possible to find information
p36
aVby using a computer algorithm,
p37
aVand this algorithm is based on machine learning.
p38
aVSince that time, there have been many commercial successes of machine learning.
p39
aVCompanies like Amazon and Netflix
p40
aVuse machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy,
p41
aVmovies that you might like to watch.
p42
aVSometimes, it's almost creepy.
p43
aVCompanies like LinkedIn and Facebook
p44
aVsometimes will tell you about who your friends might be
p45
aVand you have no idea how it did it,
p46
aVand this is because it's using the power of machine learning.
p47
aVThese are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data
p48
aVrather than being programmed by hand.
p49
aa(lp50
VThis is also how IBM was successful
p51
aVin getting Watson to beat the two world champions at "Jeopardy,"
p52
aVanswering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one.
p53
aV["The ancient 'Lion of Nimrud' went missing from this city's national museum in 2003  (along with a lot of other stuff)"]
p54
aVThis is also why we are now able to see the first self-driving cars.
p55
aVIf you want to be able to tell the difference between, say,
p56
aVa tree and a pedestrian, well, that's pretty important.
p57
aVWe don't know how to write those programs by hand,
p58
aVbut with machine learning, this is now possible.
p59
aVAnd in fact, this car has driven  over a million miles
p60
aVwithout any accidents on regular roads.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo we now know that computers can learn,
p63
aVand computers can learn to do things
p64
aVthat we actually sometimes don't know how to do ourselves,
p65
aVor maybe can do them better than us.
p66
aVOne of the most amazing examples I've seen of machine learning
p67
aVhappened on a project that I ran at Kaggle
p68
aVwhere a team run by a guy called Geoffrey Hinton
p69
aVfrom the University of Toronto
p70
aVwon a competition for automatic drug discovery.
p71
aVNow, what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat
p72
aVall of the algorithms developed by Merck or the international academic community,
p73
aVbut nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences,
p74
aVand they did it in two weeks.
p75
aVHow did they do this?
p76
aVThey used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning.
p77
aVSo important was this that in fact the success was covered
p78
aVin The New York Times in a front page article a few weeks later.
p79
aVThis is Geoffrey Hinton here on the left-hand side.
p80
aVDeep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works,
p81
aVand as a result it's an algorithm
p82
aVwhich has no theoretical limitations on what it can do.
p83
aVThe more data you give it and the more computation time you give it,
p84
aVthe better it gets.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe New York Times also showed in this article
p87
aVanother extraordinary result of deep learning
p88
aVwhich I'm going to show you now.
p89
aVIt shows that computers  can listen and understand.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Video) Richard Rashid: Now, the last step
p92
aVthat I want to be able to take in this process
p93
aVis to actually speak to you in Chinese.
p94
aVNow the key thing there is,
p95
aVwe've been able to take a large amount  of information from many Chinese speakers
p96
aVand produce a text-to-speech system
p97
aVthat takes Chinese text and converts it into Chinese language,
p98
aVand then we've taken an hour or so of my own voice
p99
aVand we've used that to modulate
p100
aVthe standard text-to-speech system so that it would sound like me.
p101
aVAgain, the result's not perfect.
p102
aVThere are in fact quite a few errors.
p103
aV(In Chinese)
p104
aV(Applause)
p105
aVThere's much work to be done in this area.
p106
aV(In Chinese)
p107
aV(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VJeremy Howard: Well, that was at a machine learning conference in China.
p110
aVIt's not often, actually, at academic conferences
p111
aVthat you do hear spontaneous applause,
p112
aValthough of course sometimes at TEDx conferences, feel free.
p113
aVEverything you saw there was happening with deep learning.
p114
aV(Applause) Thank you.
p115
aVThe transcription in English was deep learning.
p116
aVThe translation to Chinese and the text in the top right, deep learning,
p117
aVand the construction of the voice was deep learning as well.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo deep learning is this extraordinary thing.
p120
aVIt's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything,
p121
aVand I discovered that a year earlier, it had also learned to see.
p122
aVIn this obscure competition from Germany
p123
aVcalled the German Traffic Sign  Recognition Benchmark,
p124
aVdeep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this one.
p125
aVNot only could it recognize the traffic signs
p126
aVbetter than any other algorithm,
p127
aVthe leaderboard actually showed it was better than people,
p128
aVabout twice as good as people.
p129
aVSo by 2011, we had the first example
p130
aVof computers that can see better than people.
p131
aVSince that time, a lot has happened.
p132
aVIn 2012, Google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm
p133
aVwatch YouTube videos
p134
aVand crunched the data on 16,000 computers for a month,
p135
aVand the computer independently learned about concepts such as people and cats
p136
aVjust by watching the videos.
p137
aVThis is much like the way that humans learn.
p138
aVHumans don't learn by being told what they see,
p139
aVbut by learning for themselves what these things are.
p140
aVAlso in 2012, Geoffrey Hinton, who we saw earlier,
p141
aVwon the very popular ImageNet competition,
p142
aVlooking to try to figure out  from one and a half million images
p143
aVwhat they're pictures of.
p144
aVAs of 2014, we're now down to a six percent error rate
p145
aVin image recognition.
p146
aVThis is better than people, again.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo machines really are doing an extraordinarily good job of this,
p149
aVand it is now being used in industry.
p150
aVFor example, Google announced last year
p151
aVthat they had mapped every single location in France in two hours,
p152
aVand the way they did it was that they fed street view images
p153
aVinto a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers.
p154
aVImagine how long it would have taken before:
p155
aVdozens of people, many years.
p156
aVThis is also happening in China.
p157
aVBaidu is kind of  the Chinese Google, I guess,
p158
aVand what you see here in the top left
p159
aVis an example of a picture that I uploaded to Baidu's deep learning system,
p160
aVand underneath you can see that the system has understood what that picture is
p161
aVand found similar images.
p162
aVThe similar images actually have similar backgrounds,
p163
aVsimilar directions of the faces,
p164
aVeven some with their tongue out.
p165
aVThis is not clearly looking at the text of a web page.
p166
aVAll I uploaded was an image.
p167
aVSo we now have computers which really understand what they see
p168
aVand can therefore search databases
p169
aVof hundreds of millions of images in real time.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo what does it mean now that computers can see?
p172
aVWell, it's not just  that computers can see.
p173
aVIn fact, deep learning has done more than that.
p174
aVComplex, nuanced sentences like this one
p175
aVare now understandable with deep learning algorithms.
p176
aVAs you can see here,
p177
aVthis Stanford-based system showing the red dot at the top
p178
aVhas figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment.
p179
aVDeep learning now in fact is near human performance
p180
aVat understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things.
p181
aVAlso, deep learning has been used to read Chinese,
p182
aVagain at about native Chinese speaker level.
p183
aVThis algorithm developed out of Switzerland
p184
aVby people, none of whom speak or understand any Chinese.
p185
aVAs I say, using deep learning
p186
aVis about the best system in the world for this,
p187
aVeven compared to native human understanding.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is a system that we put together at my company
p190
aVwhich shows putting all this stuff together.
p191
aVThese are pictures which have no text attached,
p192
aVand as I'm typing in here sentences,
p193
aVin real time it's understanding these pictures
p194
aVand figuring out what they're about
p195
aVand finding pictures that are similar to the text that I'm writing.
p196
aVSo you can see, it's actually understanding my sentences
p197
aVand actually understanding these pictures.
p198
aVI know that you've seen something like this on Google,
p199
aVwhere you can type in things and it will show you pictures,
p200
aVbut actually what it's doing is it's searching the webpage for the text.
p201
aVThis is very different from actually understanding the images.
p202
aVThis is something that computers have only been able to do
p203
aVfor the first time in the last few months.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we can see now that computers can not only see but they can also read,
p206
aVand, of course, we've shown that they can understand what they hear.
p207
aVPerhaps not surprising now that I'm going to tell you they can write.
p208
aVHere is some text that I generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday.
p209
aVAnd here is some text that an algorithm out of Stanford generated.
p210
aVEach of these sentences was generated
p211
aVby a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures.
p212
aVThis algorithm before has never seen a man in a black shirt playing a guitar.
p213
aVIt's seen a man before, it's seen black before,
p214
aVit's seen a guitar before,
p215
aVbut it has independently generated this novel description of this picture.
p216
aVWe're still not quite at human performance here, but we're close.
p217
aVIn tests, humans prefer the computer-generated caption
p218
aVone out of four times.
p219
aVNow this system is now only two weeks old,
p220
aVso probably within the next year,
p221
aVthe computer algorithm will be well past human performance
p222
aVat the rate things are going.
p223
aVSo computers can also write.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities.
p226
aVFor example, in medicine,
p227
aVa team in Boston announced that they had discovered
p228
aVdozens of new clinically relevant features
p229
aVof tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer.
p230
aVVery similarly, in Stanford,
p231
aVa group there announced that, looking at tissues under magnification,
p232
aVthey've developed  a machine learning-based system
p233
aVwhich in fact is better than human pathologists
p234
aVat predicting survival rates for cancer sufferers.
p235
aVIn both of these cases, not only were the predictions more accurate,
p236
aVbut they generated new insightful science.
p237
aVIn the radiology case,
p238
aVthey were new clinical indicators that humans can understand.
p239
aVIn this pathology case,
p240
aVthe computer system actually discovered that the cells around the cancer
p241
aVare as important as the cancer cells themselves
p242
aVin making a diagnosis.
p243
aVThis is the opposite of what pathologists had been taught for decades.
p244
aVIn each of those two cases, they were systems developed
p245
aVby a combination of medical experts and machine learning experts,
p246
aVbut as of last year, we're now beyond that too.
p247
aVThis is an example of identifying cancerous areas
p248
aVof human tissue under a microscope.
p249
aVThe system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately,
p250
aVor about as accurately, as human pathologists,
p251
aVbut was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise
p252
aVby people who have no background in the field.
p253
aVSimilarly, here, this neuron segmentation.
p254
aVWe can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can,
p255
aVbut this system was developed with deep learning
p256
aVusing people with no previous  background in medicine.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo myself, as somebody with no previous background in medicine,
p259
aVI seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company,
p260
aVwhich I did.
p261
aVI was kind of terrified of doing it,
p262
aVbut the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible
p263
aVto do very useful medicine using just these data analytic techniques.
p264
aVAnd thankfully, the feedback has been fantastic,
p265
aVnot just from the media but from the medical community,
p266
aVwho have been very supportive.
p267
aVThe theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process
p268
aVand turn that into data analysis as much as possible,
p269
aVleaving doctors to do what they're best at.
p270
aVI want to give you an example.
p271
aVIt now takes us about 15 minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test
p272
aVand I'll show you that in real time now,
p273
aVbut I've compressed it down to  three minutes by cutting some pieces out.
p274
aVRather than showing you creating a medical diagnostic test,
p275
aVI'm going to show you  a diagnostic test of car images,
p276
aVbecause that's something we can all understand.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo here we're starting with  about 1.5 million car images,
p279
aVand I want to create something that can split them into the angle
p280
aVof the photo that's being taken.
p281
aVSo these images are entirely unlabeled, so I have to start from scratch.
p282
aVWith our deep learning algorithm,
p283
aVit can automatically identify areas of structure in these images.
p284
aVSo the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together.
p285
aVSo the human, as you can see here,
p286
aVis telling the computer about areas of interest
p287
aVwhich it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm.
p288
aVNow, these deep learning systems actually are in 16,000-dimensional space,
p289
aVso you can see here the computer rotating this through that space,
p290
aVtrying to find new areas of structure.
p291
aVAnd when it does so successfully,
p292
aVthe human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting.
p293
aVSo here, the computer has successfully found areas,
p294
aVfor example, angles.
p295
aVSo as we go through this process,
p296
aVwe're gradually telling the computer more and more
p297
aVabout the kinds of structures we're looking for.
p298
aVYou can imagine in a diagnostic test
p299
aVthis would be a pathologist identifying areas of pathosis, for example,
p300
aVor a radiologist indicating potentially troublesome nodules.
p301
aVAnd sometimes it can be difficult for the algorithm.
p302
aVIn this case, it got kind of confused.
p303
aVThe fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up.
p304
aVSo here we have to be a bit more careful,
p305
aVmanually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs,
p306
aVthen telling the computer that this is a type of group
p307
aVthat we're interested in.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo we do that for a while, we skip over a little bit,
p310
aVand then we train the machine learning algorithm
p311
aVbased on these couple of hundred things,
p312
aVand we hope that it's gotten a lot better.
p313
aVYou can see, it's now started to fade some of these pictures out,
p314
aVshowing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself.
p315
aVWe can then use this concept of similar images,
p316
aVand using similar images, you can now see,
p317
aVthe computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars.
p318
aVSo at this point, the human can tell the computer,
p319
aVokay, yes, you've done a good job of that.
p320
aa(lp321
VSometimes, of course, even at this point
p322
aVit's still difficult to separate out groups.
p323
aVIn this case, even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while,
p324
aVwe still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures
p325
aVare all mixed up together.
p326
aVSo we can again give the computer some hints,
p327
aVand we say, okay, try and find a projection that separates out
p328
aVthe left sides and the right sides as much as possible
p329
aVusing this deep learning algorithm.
p330
aVAnd giving it that hint \u2014 ah, okay, it's been successful.
p331
aVIt's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects
p332
aVthat's separated out these together.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo you get the idea here.
p335
aVThis is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer,
p336
aVbut where they're working together.
p337
aVWhat we're doing here is we're replacing something that used to take a team
p338
aVof five or six people about seven years
p339
aVand replacing it with something that takes 15 minutes
p340
aVfor one person acting alone.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo this process takes about four or five iterations.
p343
aVYou can see we now have 62 percent
p344
aVof our 1.5 million images  classified correctly.
p345
aVAnd at this point, we can start to quite quickly
p346
aVgrab whole big sections,
p347
aVcheck through them to make sure that there's no mistakes.
p348
aVWhere there are mistakes, we can let the computer know about them.
p349
aVAnd using this kind of process for each of the different groups,
p350
aVwe are now up to an 80 percent success rate
p351
aVin classifying the 1.5 million images.
p352
aVAnd at this point, it's just a case
p353
aVof finding the small number that aren't classified correctly,
p354
aVand trying to understand why.
p355
aVAnd using that approach,
p356
aVby 15 minutes we get to 97 percent classification rates.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem,
p359
aVwhich is that there's a lack of medical expertise in the world.
p360
aVThe World Economic Forum says that there's between a 10x and a 20x
p361
aVshortage of physicians in the developing world,
p362
aVand it would take about 300 years
p363
aVto train enough people to fix that problem.
p364
aVSo imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency
p365
aVusing these deep learning approaches?
p366
aa(lp367
VSo I'm very excited about the opportunities.
p368
aVI'm also concerned about the problems.
p369
aVThe problem here is that every area in blue on this map
p370
aVis somewhere where services are over 80 percent of employment.
p371
aVWhat are services?
p372
aVThese are services.
p373
aVThese are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do.
p374
aVSo 80 percent of the world's employment in the developed world
p375
aVis stuff that computers  have just learned how to do.
p376
aVWhat does that mean?
p377
aVWell, it'll be fine. They'll be replaced by other jobs.
p378
aVFor example, there will be more jobs for data scientists.
p379
aVWell, not really.
p380
aVIt doesn't take data scientists  very long to build these things.
p381
aVFor example, these four algorithms were all built by the same guy.
p382
aVSo if you think, oh,  it's all happened before,
p383
aVwe've seen the results in the past of when new things come along
p384
aVand they get replaced by new jobs,
p385
aVwhat are these new jobs going to be?
p386
aVIt's very hard for us to estimate this,
p387
aVbecause human performance grows at this gradual rate,
p388
aVbut we now have a system, deep learning,
p389
aVthat we know actually grows in capability exponentially.
p390
aVAnd we're here.
p391
aVSo currently, we see the things around us
p392
aVand we say, "Oh, computers are still pretty dumb." Right?
p393
aVBut in five years' time, computers will be off this chart.
p394
aVSo we need to be starting to think about this capability right now.
p395
aa(lp396
VWe have seen this once before, of course.
p397
aVIn the Industrial Revolution,
p398
aVwe saw a step change in capability thanks to engines.
p399
aVThe thing is, though, that after a while, things flattened out.
p400
aVThere was social disruption,
p401
aVbut once engines were used  to generate power in all the situations,
p402
aVthings really settled down.
p403
aVThe Machine Learning Revolution
p404
aVis going to be very different from the Industrial Revolution,
p405
aVbecause the Machine Learning Revolution, it never settles down.
p406
aVThe better computers get at intellectual activities,
p407
aVthe more they can build better computers to be better at intellectual capabilities,
p408
aVso this is going to be a kind of change
p409
aVthat the world has actually never experienced before,
p410
aVso your previous understanding of what's possible is different.
p411
aa(lp412
VThis is already impacting us.
p413
aVIn the last 25 years, as capital productivity has increased,
p414
aVlabor productivity has been flat, in fact even a little bit down.
p415
aa(lp416
VSo I want us to start having this discussion now.
p417
aVI know that when I often tell people about this situation,
p418
aVpeople can be quite dismissive.
p419
aVWell, computers can't really think,
p420
aVthey don't emote, they don't understand poetry,
p421
aVwe don't really understand how they work.
p422
aVSo what?
p423
