VGood afternoon.
p6
aa(lp7
VAs you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.
p8
aVI come to you with a modest proposal
p9
aVfor easing the financial burden.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis idea came to me while talking to
p12
aVa physicist friend of mine at MIT.
p13
aVHe was struggling to explain something to me:
p14
aVa beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.
p15
aVNow he confused me from the very start,
p16
aVbecause light doesn't cool things down.
p17
aVIt makes it hotter. It's happening right now.
p18
aVThe reason that you can see me standing here is because
p19
aVthis room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,
p20
aVand they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.
p21
aVAll of them are different colors,
p22
aVthey're rippling with different frequencies,
p23
aVand they're bouncing off every surface, including me,
p24
aVand some of those are flying directly into your eyes,
p25
aVand that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow a laser is different.
p28
aVIt also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,
p29
aVand if you focus them into a beam,
p30
aVwhat you have is an incredibly useful tool.
p31
aVThe control of a laser is so precise
p32
aVthat you can perform surgery inside of an eye,
p33
aVyou can use it to store massive amounts of data,
p34
aVand you can use it for this beautiful experiment
p35
aVthat my friend was struggling to explain.
p36
aVFirst you trap atoms in a special bottle.
p37
aVIt uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms
p38
aVfrom the noise of the environment.
p39
aVAnd the atoms themselves are quite violent,
p40
aVbut if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,
p41
aVan atom will briefly absorb those photons
p42
aVand tend to slow down.
p43
aVLittle by little it gets colder
p44
aVuntil eventually it approaches absolute zero.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,
p47
aVsomething truly bizarre happens.
p48
aVIt's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
p49
aVIt enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
p50
aVThe atoms lose their individual identity,
p51
aVand the rules from the quantum world take over,
p52
aVand that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
p53
aVFor example, if you shine light through a superfluid,
p54
aVit is able to slow photons down
p55
aVto 60 kilometers per hour.
p56
aVAnother spooky property is that it flows
p57
aVwith absolutely no viscosity or friction,
p58
aVso if you were to take the lid off that bottle,
p59
aVit won't stay inside.
p60
aVA thin film will creep up the inside wall,
p61
aVflow over the top and right out the outside.
p62
aVNow of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,
p63
aVand its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,
p64
aVit immediately turns back into normal matter.
p65
aVSuperfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.
p66
aVAnd this is the great pleasure of science:
p67
aVthe defeat of our intuition through experimentation.
p68
aa(lp69
VBut the experiment is not the end of the story,
p70
aVbecause you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.
p71
aVI have a Ph.D in molecular biology.
p72
aVI still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.
p73
aVSo as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,
p74
aVit seemed like the more he said,
p75
aVthe less I understood.
p76
aVBecause if you're trying to give someone the big picture
p77
aVof a complex idea, to really capture its essence,
p78
aVthe fewer words you use, the better.
p79
aVIn fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.
p80
aVI remember thinking, my friend could have explained
p81
aVthat entire experiment with a dance.
p82
aVOf course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.
p85
aVI started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
p86
aVInstead of explaining their research with words,
p87
aVscientists have to explain it with dance.
p88
aVNow surprisingly, it seems to work.
p89
aVDance really can make science easier to understand.
p90
aVBut don't take my word for it.
p91
aVGo on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."
p92
aVThere are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.
p93
aa(lp94
VThe most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest
p95
aVis that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.
p96
aVFor example, at the University of Minnesota,
p97
aVthere's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,
p98
aVand he works with dancers to study how cells move.
p99
aVThey do it by changing their shape.
p100
aVWhen a chemical signal washes up on one side,
p101
aVit triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,
p102
aVbecause the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.
p103
aVSo that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.
p104
aVBut what seems so slow and graceful from the outside
p105
aVis really more like chaos inside,
p106
aVbecause cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,
p107
aVand those fibers are constantly falling apart.
p108
aVBut just as quickly as they explode,
p109
aVmore proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,
p110
aVso it's constantly changing
p111
aVjust to remain exactly the same.
p112
aVNow, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,
p113
aVbut before he does that, he works with dancers
p114
aVto figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.
p115
aVIt's basically efficient brainstorming,
p116
aVand when I visited David to learn about his research,
p117
aVhe used dancers to explain it to me
p118
aVrather than the usual method: PowerPoint.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd this brings me to my modest proposal.
p121
aVI think that bad PowerPoint presentations
p122
aVare a serious threat to the global economy.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VNow it does depend on how you measure it, of course,
p127
aVbut one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.
p128
aVNow that assumes half-hour presentations
p129
aVfor an average audience of four people
p130
aVwith salaries of 35,000 dollars,
p131
aVand it conservatively assumes that
p132
aVabout a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,
p133
aVand given that there are some apparently
p134
aV30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,
p135
aVthat would indeed add up to an annual waste
p136
aVof 100 billion dollars.
p137
aVOf course, that's just the time we're losing
p138
aVsitting through presentations.
p139
aVThere are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,
p140
aVand like any tool, it can and will be abused.
p141
aVTo borrow a concept from my country's CIA,
p142
aVit helps you to soften up your audience.
p143
aVIt distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.
p144
aVIt allows you to create the illusion of competence,
p145
aVthe illusion of simplicity,
p146
aVand most destructively, the illusion of understanding.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.
p149
aVOur leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.
p150
aVOne idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.
p151
aVFor example, our National Endowment for the Arts,
p152
aVwith its $150 million budget,
p153
aVslashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt
p154
aVby about one one-thousandth of a percent.
p155
aVOne certainly can't argue with those numbers.
p156
aVHowever, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,
p157
aVthere will be some drawbacks.
p158
aVThe artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.
p159
aVMany will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,
p160
aVand that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.
p161
aVAll of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.
p162
aa(lp163
VI shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,
p164
aVwhich I hope will not be liable to the least objection.
p165
aVOnce we eliminate public funding for the artists,
p166
aVlet's put them back to work
p167
aVby using them instead of PowerPoint.
p168
aVAs a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.
p169
aVAfter all, they are the most perishable of their kind,
p170
aVprone to injury and very slow to heal
p171
aVdue to our health care system.
p172
aVRather than dancing our Ph.Ds,
p173
aVwe should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.
p174
aVImagine our politicians using dance
p175
aVto explain why we must invade a foreign country
p176
aVor bail out an investment bank.
p177
aVIt's sure to help.
p178
aa(lp179
VOf course someday, in the deep future,
p180
aVa technology of persuasion
p181
aVeven more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,
p182
aVrendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.
p183
aVHowever, I trust that by that day,
p184
aVwe shall have passed this present financial calamity.
p185
aVPerhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury
p186
aVof just sitting in an audience
p187
aVwith no other purpose
p188
aVthan to witness the human form in motion.
