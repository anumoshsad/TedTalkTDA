VI want to address the issue of compassion.
p4
aVCompassion has many faces.
p5
aVSome of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;
p6
aVsome of them are tender; some of them are wise.
p7
aVA line that the Dalai Lama once said,
p8
aVhe said, "Love and compassion are necessities.
p9
aVThey are not luxuries.
p10
aVWithout them,
p11
aVhumanity cannot survive."
p12
aVAnd I would suggest,
p13
aVit is not only humanity that won't survive,
p14
aVbut it is all species on the planet,
p15
aVas we've heard today.
p16
aVIt is the big cats,
p17
aVand it's the plankton.
p18
aa(lp19
VTwo weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
p20
aVI was so privileged
p21
aVto be able to teach in a hospice
p22
aVon the outskirts of Bangalore.
p23
aVAnd early in the morning,
p24
aVI went into the ward.
p25
aVIn that hospice,
p26
aVthere were 31 men and women
p27
aVwho were actively dying.
p28
aVAnd I walked up to the bedside
p29
aVof an old woman
p30
aVwho was breathing very rapidly, fragile,
p31
aVobviously in the latter phase
p32
aVof active dying.
p33
aVI looked into her face.
p34
aVI looked into the face
p35
aVof her son sitting next to her,
p36
aVand his face was just riven
p37
aVwith grief and confusion.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd I remembered
p40
aVa line from the Mahabharata,
p41
aVthe great Indian epic:
p42
aV"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"
p43
aVAnd Yudhisthira replied,
p44
aV"The most wondrous thing in the world
p45
aVis that all around us
p46
aVpeople can be dying
p47
aVand we don't realize
p48
aVit can happen to us."
p49
aVI looked up.
p50
aVTending those 31 dying people
p51
aVwere young women
p52
aVfrom villages around Bangalore.
p53
aVI looked into the face of one of these women,
p54
aVand I saw in her face
p55
aVthe strength that arises
p56
aVwhen natural compassion is really present.
p57
aVI watched her hands
p58
aVas she bathed an old man.
p59
aa(lp60
VMy gaze went to another young woman
p61
aVas she wiped the face
p62
aVof another dying person.
p63
aVAnd it reminded me
p64
aVof something that I had just been present for.
p65
aVEvery year or so,
p66
aVI have the privilege of taking clinicians
p67
aVinto the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
p68
aVAnd we run clinics
p69
aVin these very remote regions
p70
aVwhere there's no medical care whatsoever.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd on the first day at Simikot in Humla,
p73
aVfar west of Nepal,
p74
aVthe most impoverished region of Nepal,
p75
aVan old man came in
p76
aVclutching a bundle of rags.
p77
aVAnd he walked in, and somebody said something to him,
p78
aVwe realized he was deaf,
p79
aVand we looked into the rags,
p80
aVand there was this pair of eyes.
p81
aVThe rags were unwrapped
p82
aVfrom a little girl
p83
aVwhose body was massively burned.
p84
aVAgain,
p85
aVthe eyes and hands
p86
aVof Avalokiteshvara.
p87
aVIt was the young women, the health aids,
p88
aVwho cleaned the wounds of this baby
p89
aVand dressed the wounds.
p90
aa(lp91
VI know those hands and eyes;
p92
aVthey touched me as well.
p93
aVThey touched me at that time.
p94
aVThey have touched me throughout my 68 years.
p95
aVThey touched me when I was four
p96
aVand I lost my eyesight
p97
aVand was partially paralyzed.
p98
aVAnd my family brought in
p99
aVa woman whose mother had been a slave
p100
aVto take care of me.
p101
aVAnd that woman
p102
aVdid not have sentimental compassion.
p103
aVShe had phenomenal strength.
p104
aVAnd it was really her strength, I believe,
p105
aVthat became the kind of mudra and imprimatur
p106
aVthat has been a guiding light in my life.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo we can ask:
p109
aVWhat is compassion comprised of?
p110
aVAnd there are various facets.
p111
aVAnd there's referential and non-referential compassion.
p112
aVBut first, compassion is comprised
p113
aVof that capacity
p114
aVto see clearly
p115
aVinto the nature of suffering.
p116
aVIt is that ability
p117
aVto really stand strong
p118
aVand to recognize also
p119
aVthat I'm not separate from this suffering.
p120
aVBut that is not enough,
p121
aVbecause compassion,
p122
aVwhich activates the motor cortex,
p123
aVmeans that we aspire,
p124
aVwe actually aspire to transform suffering.
p125
aVAnd if we're so blessed,
p126
aVwe engage in activities
p127
aVthat transform suffering.
p128
aVBut compassion has another component,
p129
aVand that component is really essential.
p130
aVThat component
p131
aVis that we cannot be attached to outcome.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow I worked with dying people
p134
aVfor over 40 years.
p135
aVI had the privilege of working on death row
p136
aVin a maximum security [prison] for six years.
p137
aVAnd I realized so clearly
p138
aVin bringing my own life experience,
p139
aVfrom working with dying people
p140
aVand training caregivers,
p141
aVthat any attachment to outcome
p142
aVwould distort deeply
p143
aVmy own capacity to be fully present
p144
aVto the whole catastrophe.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd when I worked in the prison system,
p147
aVit was so clear to me, this:
p148
aVthat many of us
p149
aVin this room,
p150
aVand almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,
p151
aVthe seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.
p152
aVThat compassion is actually
p153
aVan inherent human quality.
p154
aVIt is there within every human being.
p155
aVBut the conditions
p156
aVfor compassion to be activated,
p157
aVto be aroused,
p158
aVare particular conditions.
p159
aVI had that condition, to a certain extent,
p160
aVfrom my own childhood illness.
p161
aVEve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,
p162
aVhas had that condition activated
p163
aVamazingly in her
p164
aVthrough the various waters of suffering
p165
aVthat she has been through.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd what is fascinating
p168
aVis that compassion has enemies,
p169
aVand those enemies are things like pity,
p170
aVmoral outrage,
p171
aVfear.
p172
aVAnd you know, we have a society, a world,
p173
aVthat is paralyzed by fear.
p174
aVAnd in that paralysis, of course,
p175
aVour capacity for compassion
p176
aVis also paralyzed.
p177
aVThe very word terror
p178
aVis global.
p179
aVThe very feeling of terror is global.
p180
aVSo our work, in a certain way,
p181
aVis to address this imago,
p182
aVthis kind of archetype
p183
aVthat has pervaded the psyche
p184
aVof our entire globe.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow we know from neuroscience
p187
aVthat compassion has
p188
aVsome very extraordinary qualities.
p189
aVFor example:
p190
aVA person who is cultivating compassion,
p191
aVwhen they are in the presence of suffering,
p192
aVthey feel that suffering a lot more
p193
aVthan many other people do.
p194
aVHowever,
p195
aVthey return to baseline a lot sooner.
p196
aVThis is called resilience.
p197
aVMany of us think that compassion drains us,
p198
aVbut I promise you
p199
aVit is something that truly enlivens us.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnother thing about compassion
p202
aVis that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
p203
aVIt hooks up all parts of the brain.
p204
aVAnother, which has been discovered
p205
aVby various researchers
p206
aVat Emory and at Davis and so on,
p207
aVis that compassion enhances our immune system.
p208
aVHey,
p209
aVwe live in a very noxious world.
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVMost of us are shrinking
p212
aVin the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,
p213
aVof the toxins of our world.
p214
aVBut compassion, the generation of compassion,
p215
aVactually mobilizes
p216
aVour immunity.
p217
aa(lp218
VYou know, if compassion is so good for us,
p219
aVI have a question.
p220
aVWhy don't we train our children
p221
aVin compassion?
p222
aV(Applause)
p223
aVIf compassion is so good for us,
p224
aVwhy don't we train our health care providers in compassion
p225
aVso that they can do what they're supposed to do,
p226
aVwhich is to really transform suffering?
p227
aVAnd if compassion is so good for us,
p228
aVwhy don't we vote on compassion?
p229
aVWhy don't we vote for people in our government
p230
aVbased on compassion,
p231
aVso that we can have
p232
aVa more caring world?
p233
aVIn Buddhism,
p234
aVwe say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."
p235
aVIt takes tremendous strength of the back
p236
aVto uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.
p237
aVAnd that is the mental quality of equanimity.
p238
aa(lp239
VBut it also takes a soft front \u2014
p240
aVthe capacity to really be open to the world as it is,
p241
aVto have an undefended heart.
p242
aVAnd the archetype of this in Buddhism
p243
aVis Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.
p244
aVIt's a female archetype:
p245
aVshe who perceives
p246
aVthe cries of suffering in the world.
p247
aVShe stands with 10,000 arms,
p248
aVand in every hand,
p249
aVthere is an instrument of liberation,
p250
aVand in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,
p251
aVand these are the eyes of wisdom.
p252
aVI say that, for thousands of years,
p253
aVwomen have lived,
p254
aVexemplified, met in intimacy,
p255
aVthe archetype of Avalokitesvara,
p256
aVof Kuan-Yin,
p257
aVshe who perceives
p258
aVthe cries of suffering in the world.
p259
aa(lp260
VWomen have manifested for thousands of years
p261
aVthe strength arising from compassion
p262
aVin an unfiltered, unmediated way
p263
aVin perceiving suffering
p264
aVas it is.
p265
aVThey have infused societies with kindness,
p266
aVand we have really felt that
p267
aVas woman after woman
p268
aVhas stood on this stage
p269
aVin the past day and a half.
p270
aVAnd they have actualized compassion
p271
aVthrough direct action.
p272
aVJody Williams called it:
p273
aVIt's good to meditate.
p274
aVI'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.
p275
aVStep back, give your mother a break, okay.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VBut the other side of the equation
p280
aVis you've got to come out of your cave.
p281
aVYou have to come into the world
p282
aVlike Asanga did,
p283
aVwho was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha
p284
aVafter 12 years sitting in the cave.
p285
aVHe said, "I'm out of here."
p286
aVHe's going down the path.
p287
aVHe sees something in the path.
p288
aVHe looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.
p289
aVHe sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.
p290
aVThe wound is just filled with maggots.
p291
aVHe puts out his tongue
p292
aVin order to remove the maggots,
p293
aVso as not to harm them.
p294
aVAnd at that moment,
p295
aVthe dog transformed
p296
aVinto the Buddha of love and kindness.
p297
aa(lp298
VI believe
p299
aVthat women and girls today
p300
aVhave to partner in a powerful way with men \u2014
p301
aVwith their fathers,
p302
aVwith their sons, with their brothers,
p303
aVwith the plumbers, the road builders,
p304
aVthe caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,
p305
aVwith our president,
p306
aVand with all beings.
p307
aVThe women in this room
p308
aVare lotuses in a sea of fire.
p309
aVMay we actualize that capacity
p310
aVfor women everywhere.
p311
