VI'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on
p4
aVinvolving a man named Steve Titus.
p5
aa(lp6
VTitus was a restaurant manager.
p7
aVHe was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,
p8
aVhe was engaged to Gretchen,
p9
aVabout to be married, she was the love of his life.
p10
aVAnd one night, the couple went out
p11
aVfor a romantic restaurant meal.
p12
aVThey were on their way home,
p13
aVand they were pulled over by a police officer.
p14
aVYou see, Titus' car sort of resembled
p15
aVa car that was driven earlier in the evening
p16
aVby a man who raped a female hitchhiker,
p17
aVand Titus kind of resembled that rapist.
p18
aVSo the police took a picture of Titus,
p19
aVthey put it in a photo lineup,
p20
aVthey later showed it to the victim,
p21
aVand she pointed to Titus' photo.
p22
aVShe said, "That one's the closest."
p23
aVThe police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,
p24
aVand when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,
p25
aVthe rape victim got on the stand
p26
aVand said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."
p27
aVAnd Titus was convicted.
p28
aVHe proclaimed his innocence,
p29
aVhis family screamed at the jury,
p30
aVhis fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,
p31
aVand Titus is taken away to jail.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo what would you do at this point?
p34
aVWhat would you do?
p35
aVWell, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,
p36
aVand yet he got an idea.
p37
aVHe called up the local newspaper,
p38
aVhe got the interest of an investigative journalist,
p39
aVand that journalist actually found the real rapist,
p40
aVa man who ultimately confessed to this rape,
p41
aVa man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes
p42
aVin that area,
p43
aVand when this information was given to the judge,
p44
aVthe judge set Titus free.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd really, that's where this case should have ended.
p47
aVIt should have been over.
p48
aVTitus should have thought of this as a horrible year,
p49
aVa year of accusation and trial, but over.
p50
aa(lp51
VIt didn't end that way.
p52
aVTitus was so bitter.
p53
aVHe'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
p54
aVHe lost his fiancée.
p55
aVShe couldn't put up with his persistent anger.
p56
aVHe lost his entire savings,
p57
aVand so he decided to file a lawsuit
p58
aVagainst the police and others whom he felt
p59
aVwere responsible for his suffering.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd that's when I really started working on this case,
p62
aVtrying to figure out
p63
aVhow did that victim go from
p64
aV"That one's the closest"
p65
aVto "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."
p66
aa(lp67
VWell, Titus was consumed with his civil case.
p68
aVHe spent every waking moment thinking about it,
p69
aVand just days before he was to have his day in court,
p70
aVhe woke up in the morning,
p71
aVdoubled over in pain,
p72
aVand died of a stress-related heart attack.
p73
aVHe was 35 years old.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I was asked to work on Titus' case
p76
aVbecause I'm a psychological scientist.
p77
aVI study memory. I've studied memory for decades.
p78
aVAnd if I meet somebody on an airplane \u2014
p79
aVthis happened on the way over to Scotland \u2014
p80
aVif I meet somebody on an airplane,
p81
aVand we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"
p82
aVand I say "I study memory,"
p83
aVthey usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,
p84
aVor they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's
p85
aVor some kind of memory problem,
p86
aVbut I have to tell them
p87
aVI don't study when people forget.
p88
aVI study the opposite: when they remember,
p89
aVwhen they remember things that didn't happen
p90
aVor remember things that were different
p91
aVfrom the way they really were.
p92
aVI study false memories.
p93
aa(lp94
VUnhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person
p95
aVto be convicted based on somebody's false memory.
p96
aVIn one project in the United States,
p97
aVinformation has been gathered
p98
aVon 300 innocent people,
p99
aV300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.
p100
aVThey spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,
p101
aVand now DNA testing has proven
p102
aVthat they are actually innocent.
p103
aVAnd when those cases have been analyzed,
p104
aVthree quarters of them
p105
aVare due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.
p106
aa(lp107
VWell, why?
p108
aVLike the jurors who convicted those innocent people
p109
aVand the jurors who convicted Titus,
p110
aVmany people believe that memory
p111
aVworks like a recording device.
p112
aVYou just record the information,
p113
aVthen you call it up and play it back
p114
aVwhen you want to answer questions or identify images.
p115
aVBut decades of work in psychology
p116
aVhas shown that this just isn't true.
p117
aVOur memories are constructive.
p118
aVThey're reconstructive.
p119
aVMemory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:
p120
aVYou can go in there and change it, but so can other people.
p121
aVI first started studying this constructive memory process
p122
aVin the 1970s.
p123
aVI did my experiments that involved showing people
p124
aVsimulated crimes and accidents
p125
aVand asking them questions about what they remember.
p126
aVIn one study, we showed people a simulated accident
p127
aVand we asked people,
p128
aVhow fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
p129
aVAnd we asked other people,
p130
aVhow fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?
p131
aVAnd if we asked the leading "smashed" question,
p132
aVthe witnesses told us the cars were going faster,
p133
aVand moreover, that leading "smashed" question
p134
aVcaused people to be more likely to tell us
p135
aVthat they saw broken glass in the accident scene
p136
aVwhen there wasn't any broken glass at all.
p137
aVIn another study, we showed a simulated accident
p138
aVwhere a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,
p139
aVand if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,
p140
aVmany witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign
p141
aVat the intersection, not a stop sign.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd you might be thinking, well, you know,
p144
aVthese are filmed events,
p145
aVthey are not particularly stressful.
p146
aVWould the same kind of mistakes be made
p147
aVwith a really stressful event?
p148
aVIn a study we published just a few months ago,
p149
aVwe have an answer to this question,
p150
aVbecause what was unusual about this study
p151
aVis we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.
p152
aVThe subjects in this study
p153
aVwere members of the U.S. military
p154
aVwho were undergoing a harrowing training exercise
p155
aVto teach them what it's going to be like for them
p156
aVif they are ever captured as prisoners of war.
p157
aVAnd as part of this training exercise,
p158
aVthese soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,
p159
aVhostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes
p160
aVand later on they have to try to identify
p161
aVthe person who conducted that interrogation.
p162
aVAnd when we feed them suggestive information
p163
aVthat insinuates it's a different person,
p164
aVmany of them misidentify their interrogator,
p165
aVoften identifying someone who doesn't even remotely
p166
aVresemble the real interrogator.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd so what these studies are showing
p169
aVis that when you feed people misinformation
p170
aVabout some experience that they may have had,
p171
aVyou can distort or contaminate or change their memory.
p172
aa(lp173
VWell out there in the real world,
p174
aVmisinformation is everywhere.
p175
aVWe get misinformation
p176
aVnot only if we're questioned in a leading way,
p177
aVbut if we talk to other witnesses
p178
aVwho might consciously or inadvertently feed us
p179
aVsome erroneous information,
p180
aVor if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,
p181
aVall of these provide the opportunity
p182
aVfor this kind of contamination of our memory.
p183
aa(lp184
VIn the 1990s, we began to see
p185
aVan even more extreme kind of memory problem.
p186
aVSome patients were going into therapy with one problem \u2014
p187
aVmaybe they had depression, an eating disorder \u2014
p188
aVand they were coming out of therapy
p189
aVwith a different problem.
p190
aVExtreme memories for horrific brutalizations,
p191
aVsometimes in satanic rituals,
p192
aVsometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.
p193
aVOne woman came out of psychotherapy
p194
aVbelieving that she'd endured years
p195
aVof ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy
p196
aVand that the baby was cut from her belly.
p197
aVBut there were no physical scars
p198
aVor any kind of physical evidence
p199
aVthat could have supported her story.
p200
aVAnd when I began looking into these cases,
p201
aVI was wondering,
p202
aVwhere do these bizarre memories come from?
p203
aVAnd what I found is that most of these situations
p204
aVinvolved some particular form of psychotherapy.
p205
aVAnd so I asked,
p206
aVwere some of the things going on in this psychotherapy \u2014
p207
aVlike the imagination exercises
p208
aVor dream interpretation,
p209
aVor in some cases hypnosis,
p210
aVor in some cases exposure to false information \u2014
p211
aVwere these leading these patients
p212
aVto develop these very bizarre,
p213
aVunlikely memories?
p214
aVAnd I designed some experiments
p215
aVto try to study the processes that were being used
p216
aVin this psychotherapy so I could study
p217
aVthe development of these very rich false memories.
p218
aa(lp219
VIn one of the first studies we did,
p220
aVwe used suggestion,
p221
aVa method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,
p222
aVwe used this kind of suggestion
p223
aVand planted a false memory
p224
aVthat when you were a kid, five or six years old,
p225
aVyou were lost in a shopping mall.
p226
aVYou were frightened. You were crying.
p227
aVYou were ultimately rescued by an elderly person
p228
aVand reunited with the family.
p229
aVAnd we succeeded in planting this memory
p230
aVin the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.
p231
aVAnd you might be thinking, well,
p232
aVthat's not particularly stressful.
p233
aVBut we and other investigators have planted
p234
aVrich false memories of things that were
p235
aVmuch more unusual and much more stressful.
p236
aVSo in a study done in Tennessee,
p237
aVresearchers planted the false memory
p238
aVthat when you were a kid, you nearly drowned
p239
aVand had to be rescued by a life guard.
p240
aVAnd in a study done in Canada,
p241
aVresearchers planted the false memory
p242
aVthat when you were a kid,
p243
aVsomething as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal
p244
aVhappened to you,
p245
aVsucceeding with about half of their subjects.
p246
aVAnd in a study done in Italy,
p247
aVresearchers planted the false memory,
p248
aVwhen you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.
p249
aa(lp250
VI do want to add that it might seem
p251
aVlike we are traumatizing these experimental subjects
p252
aVin the name of science,
p253
aVbut our studies have gone through thorough evaluation
p254
aVby research ethics boards
p255
aVthat have made the decision
p256
aVthat the temporary discomfort that some
p257
aVof these subjects might experience in these studies
p258
aVis outweighed by the importance of this problem
p259
aVfor understanding memory processes
p260
aVand the abuse of memory that is going on
p261
aVin some places in the world.
p262
aa(lp263
VWell, to my surprise,
p264
aVwhen I published this work and began to speak out
p265
aVagainst this particular brand of psychotherapy,
p266
aVit created some pretty bad problems for me:
p267
aVhostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,
p268
aVwho felt under attack,
p269
aVand by the patients whom they had influenced.
p270
aVI had sometimes armed guards at speeches
p271
aVthat I was invited to give,
p272
aVpeople trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.
p273
aVBut probably the worst
p274
aVwas I suspected that a woman
p275
aVwas innocent of abuse
p276
aVthat was being claimed by her grown daughter.
p277
aVShe accused her mother of sexual abuse
p278
aVbased on a repressed memory.
p279
aVAnd this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story
p280
aVto be filmed and presented in public places.
p281
aVI was suspicious of this story,
p282
aVand so I started to investigate,
p283
aVand eventually found information that convinced me
p284
aVthat this mother was innocent.
p285
aVI published an exposé on the case,
p286
aVand a little while later, the accusing daughter
p287
aVfiled a lawsuit.
p288
aVEven though I'd never mentioned her name,
p289
aVshe sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
p290
aVAnd I went through nearly five years
p291
aVof dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,
p292
aVbut finally, finally, it was over and I could really
p293
aVget back to my work.
p294
aVIn the process, however, I became part
p295
aVof a disturbing trend in America
p296
aVwhere scientists are being sued
p297
aVfor simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.
p298
aa(lp299
VWhen I got back to my work, I asked this question:
p300
aVif I plant a false memory in your mind,
p301
aVdoes it have repercussions?
p302
aVDoes it affect your later thoughts,
p303
aVyour later behaviors?
p304
aVOur first study planted a false memory
p305
aVthat you got sick as a child eating certain foods:
p306
aVhard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.
p307
aVAnd we found that once we planted this false memory,
p308
aVpeople didn't want to eat the foods as much
p309
aVat an outdoor picnic.
p310
aVThe false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.
p311
aVIf we planted a warm, fuzzy memory
p312
aVinvolving a healthy food like asparagus,
p313
aVwe could get people to want to eat asparagus more.
p314
aVAnd so what these studies are showing
p315
aVis that you can plant false memories
p316
aVand they have repercussions
p317
aVthat affect behavior long after the memories take hold.
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, along with this ability
p320
aVto plant memories and control behavior
p321
aVobviously come some important ethical issues,
p322
aVlike, when should we use this mind technology?
p323
aVAnd should we ever ban its use?
p324
aVTherapists can't ethically plant false memories
p325
aVin the mind of their patients
p326
aVeven if it would help the patient,
p327
aVbut there's nothing to stop a parent
p328
aVfrom trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.
p329
aVAnd when I suggested this publicly,
p330
aVit created an outcry again.
p331
aV"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."
p332
aa(lp333
VHello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VI mean, another way to think about this is,
p336
aVwhich would you rather have,
p337
aVa kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,
p338
aVall the things that go with it,
p339
aVor a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?
p340
aVI know what I would choose for a kid of mine.
p341
aa(lp342
VBut maybe my work has made me different from most people.
p343
aVMost people cherish their memories,
p344
aVknow that they represent their identity,
p345
aVwho they are, where they came from.
p346
aVAnd I appreciate that. I feel that way too.
p347
aVBut I know from my work
p348
aVhow much fiction is already in there.
p349
aVIf I've learned anything from these decades
p350
aVof working on these problems, it's this:
p351
aVjust because somebody tells you something
p352
aVand they say it with confidence,
p353
aVjust because they say it with lots of detail,
p354
aVjust because they express emotion when they say it,
p355
aVit doesn't mean that it really happened.
p356
aVWe can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.
p357
aVWe need independent corroboration.
p358
aVSuch a discovery has made me more tolerant
p359
aVof the everyday memory mistakes
p360
aVthat my friends and family members make.
p361
aVSuch a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,
p362
aVthe man whose whole future was snatched away
p363
aVby a false memory.
p364
aa(lp365
VBut meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,
p366
aVwe'd do well to,
p367
aVthat memory, like liberty,
p368
aVis a fragile thing.
p369
aVThank you. Thank you.
p370
aVThank you. (Applause)
p371
aVThanks very much. (Applause)
