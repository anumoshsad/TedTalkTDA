VOne of my earliest memories
p4
aVis of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to.
p5
aVAnd I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why,
p6
aVbut as I got older,
p7
aVI realized we had drug addiction in my family,
p8
aVincluding later cocaine addiction.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years
p11
aVsince drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain,
p12
aVand we then imposed that on the rest of the world.
p13
aVIt's a century since we made this really fateful decision
p14
aVto take addicts and punish them and make them suffer,
p15
aVbecause we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love,
p18
aVand trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.
p19
aVAnd I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions
p20
aVI just didn't know the answer to,
p21
aVlike, what really causes addiction?
p22
aVWhy do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working,
p23
aVand is there a better way out there that we could try instead?
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I read loads of stuff about it,
p26
aVand I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for,
p27
aVso I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world
p28
aVwho lived this and studied this
p29
aVand talk to them and see if I could learn from them.
p30
aVAnd I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start,
p31
aVbut I ended up going and meeting loads of different people,
p32
aVfrom a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn,
p33
aVto a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses
p34
aVto see if they like them \u2014
p35
aVit turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances \u2014
p36
aVto the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs,
p37
aVfrom cannabis to crack, Portugal.
p38
aVAnd the thing I realized that really blew my mind is,
p39
aValmost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong,
p40
aVand if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction,
p41
aVI think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew.
p44
aVLet's think about this middle row here.
p45
aVImagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day.
p46
aVSome of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVDon't worry, it's just a thought experiment.
p49
aVImagine you did that, right?
p50
aVWhat would happen?
p51
aVNow, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.
p52
aVWe think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin,
p53
aVas you took it for a while,
p54
aVyour body would become dependent on those hooks,
p55
aVyou'd start to physically need them,
p56
aVand at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
p57
aVThat's what I thought.
p58
aa(lp59
VFirst thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story
p60
aVis when it was explained to me.
p61
aVIf I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,
p62
aVI'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.
p63
aVDiamorphine is heroin.
p64
aVIt's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets,
p65
aVbecause the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated.
p66
aVActually, very little of it is heroin,
p67
aVwhereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.
p68
aVAnd you'll be given it for quite a long period of time.
p69
aVThere are loads of people in this room,
p70
aVyou may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin.
p71
aVAnd anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.
p72
aVAnd if what we believe about addiction is right \u2014
p73
aVthose people are exposed to all those chemical hooks \u2014
p74
aVWhat should happen? They should become addicts.
p75
aVThis has been studied really carefully.
p76
aVIt doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement,
p77
aVshe didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me,
p80
aVso contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew,
p81
aVI just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.
p82
aVHe's a professor of psychology in Vancouver
p83
aVwho carried out an incredible experiment
p84
aVI think really helps us to understand this issue.
p85
aVProfessor Alexander explained to me,
p86
aVthe idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story,
p87
aVcomes partly from a series of experiments
p88
aVthat were done earlier in the 20th century.
p89
aVThey're really simple.
p90
aVYou can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.
p91
aVYou get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles:
p92
aVOne is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.
p93
aVIf you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water
p94
aVand almost always kill itself quite quickly.
p95
aVSo there you go, right? That's how we think it works.
p96
aVIn the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment
p97
aVand he noticed something.
p98
aVHe said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.
p99
aVIt's got nothing to do except use these drugs.
p100
aVLet's try something different.
p101
aVSo Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park,"
p102
aVwhich is basically heaven for rats.
p103
aVThey've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls,
p104
aVthey've got loads of tunnels.
p105
aVCrucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex.
p106
aVAnd they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.
p107
aVBut here's the fascinating thing:
p108
aVIn Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
p109
aVThey almost never use it.
p110
aVNone of them ever use it compulsively.
p111
aVNone of them ever overdose.
p112
aVYou go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated
p113
aVto zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought,
p116
aVmaybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us.
p117
aVMaybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know \u2014
p118
aVBut fortunately, there was a human experiment
p119
aVinto the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.
p120
aVIt was called the Vietnam War.
p121
aVIn Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin,
p122
aVand if you look at the news reports from the time,
p123
aVthey were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have
p124
aVhundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States
p125
aVwhen the war ends; it made total sense.
p126
aVNow, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.
p127
aVThe Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study,
p128
aVand what happened to them?
p129
aVIt turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal.
p130
aVNinety-five percent of them just stopped.
p131
aVNow, if you believe the story about chemical hooks,
p132
aVthat makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think
p133
aVthere might be a different story about addiction.
p134
aVHe said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?
p135
aVWhat if addiction is about your cage?
p136
aVWhat if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?
p137
aa(lp138
VLooking at this,
p139
aVthere was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands
p140
aVwho said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.
p141
aVMaybe we should call it bonding.
p142
aVHuman beings have a natural and innate need to bond,
p143
aVand when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other,
p144
aVbut if you can't do that,
p145
aVbecause you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life,
p146
aVyou will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.
p147
aVNow, that might be gambling, that might be pornography,
p148
aVthat might be cocaine, that might be cannabis,
p149
aVbut you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature.
p150
aVThat's what we want as human beings.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around,
p153
aVbut one way that helped me to think about it is,
p154
aVI can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right?
p155
aVI'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you.
p156
aVForget the drugs. Forget the drug war.
p157
aVTotally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?
p158
aVWe could all be getting drunk \u2014 I might after this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p159
aVbut we're not.
p160
aVNow, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds
p161
aVthat it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford
p162
aVto be drinking vodka for the next six months.
p163
aVYou wouldn't end up homeless.
p164
aVYou're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that
p165
aVis not because anyone's stopping you.
p166
aVIt's because you've got bonds and connections
p167
aVthat you want to be present for.
p168
aVYou've got work you love. You've got people you love.
p169
aVYou've got healthy relationships.
p170
aVAnd a core part of addiction,
p171
aVI came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests,
p172
aVis about not being able to bear to be present in your life.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, this has really significant implications.
p175
aVThe most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs.
p176
aVIn Arizona, I went out with a group of women
p177
aVwho were made to wear t-shirts saying, "I was a drug addict,"
p178
aVand go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them,
p179
aVand when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records
p180
aVthat mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.
p181
aVNow, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang,
p182
aVbut actually almost everywhere in the world
p183
aVwe treat addicts to some degree like that.
p184
aVWe punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records.
p185
aVWe put barriers between them reconnecting.
p186
aVThere was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,
p187
aVwho said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse,
p188
aVyou would design that system.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite,
p191
aVand I went there to see how it worked.
p192
aVIn the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.
p193
aVOne percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,
p194
aVand every year, they tried the American way more and more.
p195
aVThey punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more,
p196
aVand every year, the problem got worse.
p197
aVAnd one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together,
p198
aVand basically said, look, we can't go on
p199
aVwith a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts.
p200
aVLet's set up a panel of scientists and doctors
p201
aVto figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.
p202
aVAnd they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,
p203
aVto look at all this new evidence,
p204
aVand they came back and they said,
p205
aV"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but" \u2014
p206
aVand this is the crucial next step \u2014
p207
aV"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off,
p208
aVon disconnecting them,
p209
aVand spend it instead on reconnecting them with society."
p210
aVAnd that's not really what we think of as drug treatment
p211
aVin the United States and Britain.
p212
aVSo they do do residential rehab,
p213
aVthey do psychological therapy, that does have some value.
p214
aVBut the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do:
p215
aVa massive program of job creation for addicts,
p216
aVand microloans for addicts to set up small businesses.
p217
aVSo say you used to be a mechanic.
p218
aVWhen you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say,
p219
aVif you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.
p220
aVThe goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal
p221
aVhad something to get out of bed for in the morning.
p222
aVAnd when I went and met the addicts in Portugal,
p223
aVwhat they said is, as they rediscovered purpose,
p224
aVthey rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.
p225
aa(lp226
VIt'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began,
p227
aVand the results are in:
p228
aVinjecting drug use is down in Portugal,
p229
aVaccording to the British Journal of Criminology,
p230
aVby 50 percent, five-zero percent.
p231
aVOverdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts.
p232
aVAddiction in every study is significantly down.
p233
aVOne of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal
p234
aVwants to go back to the old system.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow, that's the political implications.
p237
aVI actually think there's a layer of implications
p238
aVto all this research below that.
p239
aVWe live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable
p240
aVto all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones
p241
aVor to shopping or to eating.
p242
aVBefore these talks began \u2014 you guys know this \u2014
p243
aVwe were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on,
p244
aVand I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like
p245
aVaddicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable
p246
aVfor the next couple of hours. (Laughter)
p247
aVA lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say,
p248
aVI've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction
p249
aVand weird to say it's growing,
p250
aVbecause you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.
p251
aVBut I increasingly began to think that the connections we have
p252
aVor think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection.
p253
aVIf you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something.
p254
aVIt won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.
p255
aVIt won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round.
p256
aVIt'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced
p257
aVand textured, face-to-face relationships with,
p258
aVand there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,
p259
aVthat I think tells us a lot about this.
p260
aVIt looked at the number of close friends the average American believes
p261
aVthey can call on in a crisis.
p262
aVThat number has been declining steadily since the 1950s.
p263
aVThe amount of floor space an individual has in their home
p264
aVhas been steadily increasing,
p265
aVand I think that's like a metaphor
p266
aVfor the choice we've made as a culture.
p267
aVWe've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections,
p268
aVand the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been.
p269
aVAnd Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says,
p270
aVwe talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery,
p271
aVand it's right to talk about that,
p272
aVbut we need to talk much more about social recovery.
p273
aVSomething's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group,
p274
aVand we've created a society where, for a lot of us,
p275
aVlife looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage
p276
aVand a whole lot less like Rat Park.
p277
aa(lp278
VIf I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it.
p279
aVI didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff.
p280
aVI wanted to know how to help the people I love.
p281
aVAnd when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this,
p282
aVI looked at the addicts in my life,
p283
aVand if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict,
p284
aVand there's going to be lots of people who know in this room.
p285
aVYou are angry a lot of the time,
p286
aVand I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged
p287
aVis because it runs through the heart of each of us, right?
p288
aVEveryone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks,
p289
aVI wish someone would just stop you.
p290
aVAnd the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives
p291
aVis typified by, I think,
p292
aVthe reality show "Intervention," if you guys have ever seen it.
p293
aVI think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV,
p294
aVbut that's another TED Talk.
p295
aVIf you've ever seen the show "Intervention,"
p296
aVit's a pretty simple premise.
p297
aVGet an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together,
p298
aVconfront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up,
p299
aVwe're going to cut you off.
p300
aVSo what they do is they take the connection to the addict,
p301
aVand they threaten it, they make it contingent
p302
aVon the addict behaving the way they want.
p303
aVAnd I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work,
p304
aVand I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War
p305
aVinto our private lives.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese?
p308
aVAnd what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently
p309
aVand I can't tell you it's easy,
p310
aVis to say to the addicts in my life
p311
aVthat I want to deepen the connection with them,
p312
aVto say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not.
p313
aVI love you, whatever state you're in,
p314
aVand if you need me, I'll come and sit with you
p315
aVbecause I love you and I don't want you to be alone
p316
aVor to feel alone.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd I think the core of that message \u2014
p319
aVyou're not alone, we love you \u2014
p320
aVhas to be at every level of how we respond to addicts,
p321
aVsocially, politically and individually.
p322
aVFor 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts.
p323
aVI think all along we should have been singing love songs to them,
p324
aVbecause the opposite of addiction is not sobriety.
p325
aVThe opposite of addiction is connection.
p326
