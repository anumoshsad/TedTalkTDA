VWelcome to "Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do."
p4
aVI don't have children.
p5
aVI borrow my friends' children, so \u2014
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
Vtake all this advice with a grain of salt.
p10
aVI'm Gever Tulley.
p11
aVI'm a contract computer scientist by trade,
p12
aVbut I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School.
p13
aVIt's a summer program which aims to help kids
p14
aVlearn how to build the things that they think of.
p15
aVSo we build a lot of things,
p16
aVand I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders.
p17
aVSo if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School,
p18
aVthey do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VYou know, we live in a world
p23
aVthat's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.
p24
aVThere doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy
p25
aVchild safety regulations can get.
p26
aVWe put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film
p27
aVmanufactured in the United States,
p28
aVor for sale with an item in the United States.
p29
aVWe put warnings on coffee cups
p30
aVto tell us that the contents may be hot.
p31
aVAnd we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp
p32
aVfor children under the age of 10.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo where does this trend stop?
p35
aVWhen we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object,
p36
aVevery pokey bit in the world,
p37
aVthen the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp,
p38
aVor not made out of round plastic,
p39
aVthey'll hurt themselves with it.
p40
aVSo, as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone
p41
aVgrow ever smaller,
p42
aVwe cut off our children from valuable opportunities
p43
aVto learn how to interact with the world around them.
p44
aVAnd despite all of our best efforts and intentions,
p45
aVkids are always going to figure out
p46
aVhow to do the most dangerous thing they can,
p47
aVin whatever environment they can.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo despite the provocative title,
p52
aVthis presentation is really about safety,
p53
aVand about some simple things that we can do
p54
aVto raise our kids to be creative,
p55
aVconfident and in control of the environment around them.
p56
aVAnd what I now present to you
p57
aVis an excerpt from a book in progress.
p58
aVThe book is called "50 Dangerous Things."
p59
aVThis is "Five Dangerous Things."
p60
aa(lp61
VThing number one: Play with fire.
p62
aVLearning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature
p63
aVis a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.
p64
aVWhether we remember it or not,
p65
aVit's the first time we really get control
p66
aVof one of these mysterious things.
p67
aVThese mysteries are only revealed
p68
aVto those who get the opportunity to play with it.
p69
aVSo, playing with fire.
p70
aVThis is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.
p71
aVFrom playing with it, they learn some basic principles about fire,
p72
aVabout intake, combustion, exhaust.
p73
aVThese are the three working elements of fire
p74
aVthat you have to have for a good, controlled fire.
p75
aVAnd you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory.
p76
aVYou don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it.
p77
aVLet them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me,
p78
aVthey're going to learn things
p79
aVthat you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VNumber two: Own a pocketknife.
p84
aVPocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness,
p85
aVwhich I think is a terrible thing.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VYour first pocketknife is like the first universal tool
p90
aVthat you're given.
p91
aVYou know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,
p92
aVit's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
p93
aVAnd it's a powerful and empowering tool.
p94
aVAnd in a lot of cultures they give knives \u2014
p95
aVlike, as soon as they're toddlers, they have knives.
p96
aVThese are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.
p97
aVI first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10,
p98
aVand it left a lasting impression,
p99
aVto see babies playing with knives.
p100
aVAnd it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self
p101
aVthrough a tool at a very young age.
p102
aVYou lay down a couple of very simple rules \u2014
p103
aValways cut away from your body, keep the blade sharp, never force it \u2014
p104
aVand these are things kids can understand and practice with.
p105
aVAnd yeah, they're going to cut themselves.
p106
aVI have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself.
p107
aVBut you know, they're young. They heal fast.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VNumber three: Throw a spear.
p112
aVIt turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things,
p113
aVand like muscles, if you don't use parts of your brain,
p114
aVthey tend to atrophy over time.
p115
aVBut when you exercise them,
p116
aVany given muscle adds strength to the whole system,
p117
aVand that applies to your brain, too.
p118
aVSo practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate
p119
aVthe frontal and parietal lobes,
p120
aVwhich have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding,
p121
aVand structural problem solving,
p122
aVso it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.
p123
aVAnd throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill,
p124
aVso it's very good for that kind of whole-body training.
p125
aVThese kinds of target-based practices also help kids develop
p126
aVattention and concentration skills,
p127
aVso those are great.
p128
aa(lp129
VNumber [four]: Deconstruct appliances.
p130
aVThere is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.
p131
aVNext time you're about to throw out an appliance,
p132
aVdon't throw it out.
p133
aVTake it apart with your kid,
p134
aVor send him to my school, and we'll take it apart with them.
p135
aVEven if you don't know what the parts are,
p136
aVpuzzling out what they might be for
p137
aVis a really good practice for the kids
p138
aVto get sort of the sense that they can take things apart,
p139
aVand no matter how complex they are,
p140
aVthey can understand parts of them.
p141
aVAnd that means that eventually, they can understand all of them.
p142
aVIt's a sense of knowability, that something is knowable.
p143
aVSo these black boxes that we live with and take for granted
p144
aVare actually complex things made by other people,
p145
aVand you can understand them.
p146
aa(lp147
VNumber five: Two-parter.
p148
aVBreak the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThere are laws beyond safety regulations
p153
aVthat attempt to limit how we can interact with the things
p154
aVthat we own \u2014 in this case, digital media.
p155
aVIt's a very simple exercise:
p156
aVBuy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,
p157
aVthen rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer.
p158
aVYou've just broken a law.
p159
aVTechnically, the RIAA could come and prosecute you.
p160
aVIt's an important lesson for kids to understand,
p161
aVthat some of these laws get broken by accident,
p162
aVand that laws have to be interpreted.
p163
aVThat's something we often talk about with the kids
p164
aVwhen we're fooling around with things and breaking them open,
p165
aVand taking them apart and using them for other things.
p166
aVAnd also when we go out and drive a car.
p167
aVDriving a car is a really empowering act for a young child,
p168
aVso this is the alternate \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VFor those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law,
p173
aVyou can drive a car with your child.
p174
aVThis is a great stage for a kid.
p175
aVThis happens about the same time
p176
aVthat they get latched onto things like dinosaurs,
p177
aVthese big things in the outside world,
p178
aVthat they're trying to get a grip on.
p179
aVA car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.
p180
aVAnd that really gives them a handle on a world
p181
aVin a way that they don't often have access to.
p182
aVAnd it's perfectly legal.
p183
aVFind a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it,
p184
aVand that it's on private property, and let them drive your car.
p185
aVIt's very safe actually.
p186
aVAnd it's fun for the whole family.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
