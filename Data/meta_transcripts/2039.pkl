VWhat do you think of when I say the word "design"?
p4
aVYou probably think of things like this,
p5
aVfinely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,
p6
aVor maybe logos and posters and maps
p7
aVthat visually explain things,
p8
aVclassic icons of timeless design.
p9
aVBut I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.
p10
aVI want to talk about the kind
p11
aVthat you probably use every day
p12
aVand may not give much thought to,
p13
aVdesigns that change all the time
p14
aVand that live inside your pocket.
p15
aVI'm talking about the design
p16
aVof digital experiences
p17
aVand specifically the design of systems
p18
aVthat are so big that their scale
p19
aVcan be hard to comprehend.
p20
aVConsider the fact that Google processes
p21
aVover one billion search queries every day,
p22
aVthat every minute, over 100 hours
p23
aVof footage are uploaded to YouTube.
p24
aVThat's more in a single day
p25
aVthan all three major U.S. networks broadcast
p26
aVin the last five years combined.
p27
aVAnd Facebook transmitting the photos,
p28
aVmessages and stories
p29
aVof over 1.23 billion people.
p30
aVThat's almost half of the Internet population,
p31
aVand a sixth of humanity.
p32
aa(lp33
VThese are some of the products
p34
aVthat I've helped design over the course of my career,
p35
aVand their scale is so massive
p36
aVthat they've produced unprecedented
p37
aVdesign challenges.
p38
aVBut what is really hard
p39
aVabout designing at scale is this:
p40
aVIt's hard in part because
p41
aVit requires a combination of two things,
p42
aVaudacity and humility \u2014
p43
aVaudacity to believe that the thing that you're making
p44
aVis something that the entire world wants and needs,
p45
aVand humility to understand that as a designer,
p46
aVit's not about you or your portfolio,
p47
aVit's about the people that you're designing for,
p48
aVand how your work just might help them
p49
aVlive better lives.
p50
aVNow, unfortunately, there's no school
p51
aVthat offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.
p52
aVI and the other designers
p53
aVwho work on these kinds of products
p54
aVhave had to invent it as we go along,
p55
aVand we are teaching ourselves
p56
aVthe emerging best practices
p57
aVof designing at scale,
p58
aVand today I'd like share some of the things
p59
aVthat we've learned over the years.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, the first thing that you need to know
p62
aVabout designing at scale
p63
aVis that the little things really matter.
p64
aVHere's a really good example of how
p65
aVa very tiny design element can make a big impact.
p66
aVThe team at Facebook that manages
p67
aVthe Facebook "Like" button
p68
aVdecided that it needed to be redesigned.
p69
aVThe button had kind of gotten out of sync
p70
aVwith the evolution of our brand
p71
aVand it needed to be modernized.
p72
aVNow you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,
p73
aVit probably is a pretty straightforward,
p74
aVeasy design assignment, but it wasn't.
p75
aVTurns out, there were all kinds of constraints
p76
aVfor the design of this button.
p77
aVYou had to work within specific height and width parameters.
p78
aVYou had to be careful to make it work
p79
aVin a bunch of different languages,
p80
aVand be careful about using fancy gradients or borders
p81
aVbecause it has to degrade gracefully
p82
aVin old web browsers.
p83
aVThe truth is, designing this tiny little button
p84
aVwas a huge pain in the butt.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, this is the new version of the button,
p87
aVand the designer who led this project estimates
p88
aVthat he spent over 280 hours
p89
aVredesigning this button over the course of months.
p90
aVNow, why would we spend so much time
p91
aVon something so small?
p92
aVIt's because when you're designing at scale,
p93
aVthere's no such thing as a small detail.
p94
aVThis innocent little button
p95
aVis seen on average 22 billion times a day
p96
aVand on over 7.5 million websites.
p97
aVIt's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created.
p98
aVNow that's a lot of pressure for a little button
p99
aVand the designer behind it,
p100
aVbut with these kinds of products,
p101
aVyou need to get even the tiny things right.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, the next thing that you need to understand
p104
aVis how to design with data.
p105
aVNow, when you're working on products like this,
p106
aVyou have incredible amounts of information
p107
aVabout how people are using your product
p108
aVthat you can then use to influence
p109
aVyour design decisions,
p110
aVbut it's not just as simple as following the numbers.
p111
aVLet me give you an example
p112
aVso that you can understand what I mean.
p113
aVFacebook has had a tool for a long time
p114
aVthat allowed people to report photos
p115
aVthat may be in violation of our community standards,
p116
aVthings like spam and abuse.
p117
aVAnd there were a ton of photos reported,
p118
aVbut as it turns out,
p119
aVonly a small percentage were actually
p120
aVin violation of those community standards.
p121
aVMost of them were just your typical party photo.
p122
aVNow, to give you a specific hypothetical example,
p123
aVlet's say my friend Laura hypothetically
p124
aVuploads a picture of me
p125
aVfrom a drunken night of karaoke.
p126
aVThis is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVNow, incidentally,
p129
aVyou know how some people are kind of worried
p130
aVthat their boss or employee
p131
aVis going to discover embarrassing photos of them
p132
aVon Facebook?
p133
aVDo you know how hard that is to avoid
p134
aVwhen you actually work at Facebook?
p135
aVSo anyway, there are lots of these photos
p136
aVbeing erroneously reported as spam and abuse,
p137
aVand one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.
p138
aVHe really thought there was something else going on
p139
aVand he was right,
p140
aVbecause when he looked through a bunch of the cases,
p141
aVhe found that most of them
p142
aVwere from people who were requesting
p143
aVthe takedown of a photo of themselves.
p144
aVNow this was a scenario that the team
p145
aVnever even took into account before.
p146
aVSo they added a new feature
p147
aVthat allowed people to message their friend
p148
aVto ask them to take the photo down.
p149
aVBut it didn't work.
p150
aVOnly 20 percent of people
p151
aVsent the message to their friend.
p152
aVSo the team went back at it.
p153
aVThey consulted with experts in conflict resolution.
p154
aVThey even studied the universal principles
p155
aVof polite language,
p156
aVwhich I didn't even actually know existed
p157
aVuntil this research happened.
p158
aVAnd they found something really interesting.
p159
aVThey had to go beyond just helping people
p160
aVask their friend to take the photo down.
p161
aVThey had to help people express to their friend
p162
aVhow the photo made them feel.
p163
aa(lp164
VHere's how the experience works today.
p165
aVSo I find this hypothetical photo of myself,
p166
aVand it's not spam, it's not abuse,
p167
aVbut I really wish it weren't on the site.
p168
aVSo I report it and I say,
p169
aV"I'm in this photo and I don't like it,"
p170
aVand then we dig deeper.
p171
aVWhy don't you like this photo of yourself?
p172
aVAnd I select "It's embarrassing."
p173
aVAnd then I'm encouraged to message my friend,
p174
aVbut here's the critical difference.
p175
aVI'm provided specific suggested language
p176
aVthat helps me communicate to Laura
p177
aVhow the photo makes me feel.
p178
aVNow the team found that this relatively small change
p179
aVhad a huge impact.
p180
aVBefore, only 20 percent of people
p181
aVwere sending the message,
p182
aVand now 60 percent were,
p183
aVand surveys showed that people
p184
aVon both sides of the conversation
p185
aVfelt better as a result.
p186
aVThat same survey showed
p187
aVthat 90 percent of your friends
p188
aVwant to know if they've done something to upset you.
p189
aVNow I don't know who the other 10 percent are,
p190
aVbut maybe that's where our "Unfriend" feature
p191
aVcan come in handy.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo as you can see,
p194
aVthese decisions are highly nuanced.
p195
aVOf course we use a lot of data
p196
aVto inform our decisions,
p197
aVbut we also rely very heavily on iteration,
p198
aVresearch, testing, intuition, human empathy.
p199
aVIt's both art and science.
p200
aVNow, sometimes the designers who work on these products
p201
aVare called "data-driven,"
p202
aVwhich is a term that totally drives us bonkers.
p203
aVThe fact is, it would be irresponsible of us
p204
aVnot to rigorously test our designs
p205
aVwhen so many people are counting on us
p206
aVto get it right,
p207
aVbut data analytics
p208
aVwill never be a substitute for design intuition.
p209
aVData can help you make a good design great,
p210
aVbut it will never made a bad design good.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe next thing that you need to understand as a principle
p213
aVis that when you introduce change,
p214
aVyou need to do it extraordinarily carefully.
p215
aVNow I often have joked that
p216
aVI spend almost as much time
p217
aVdesigning the introduction of change
p218
aVas I do the change itself,
p219
aVand I'm sure that we can all relate to that
p220
aVwhen something that we use a lot changes
p221
aVand then we have to adjust.
p222
aVThe fact is, people can become
p223
aVvery efficient at using bad design,
p224
aVand so even if the change is good for them in the long run,
p225
aVit's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,
p226
aVand this is particularly true
p227
aVwith user-generated content platforms,
p228
aVbecause people can rightfully claim a sense of ownership.
p229
aVIt is, after all, their content.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,
p232
aVwe were looking for ways to
p233
aVencourage more people to rate videos,
p234
aVand it was interesting because when we looked into the data,
p235
aVwe found that almost everyone was exclusively using
p236
aVthe highest five-star rating,
p237
aVa handful of people were using
p238
aVthe lowest one-star,
p239
aVand virtually no one
p240
aVwas using two, three or four stars.
p241
aVSo we decided to simplify
p242
aVinto an up-down kind of voting binary model.
p243
aVIt's going to be much easier for people to engage with.
p244
aVBut people were very attached
p245
aVto the five-star rating system.
p246
aVVideo creators really loved their ratings.
p247
aVMillions and millions of people
p248
aVwere accustomed to the old design.
p249
aVSo in order to help people
p250
aVprepare themselves for change
p251
aVand acclimate to the new design more quickly,
p252
aVwe actually published the data graph
p253
aVsharing with the community
p254
aVthe rationale for what we were going to do,
p255
aVand it even engaged the larger industry
p256
aVin a conversation, which resulted in
p257
aVmy favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:
p258
aV"YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:
p259
aVIts Ratings Are Useless."
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, it's impossible to completely avoid
p262
aVchange aversion when you're making changes
p263
aVto products that so many people use.
p264
aVEven though we tried to do all the right things,
p265
aVwe still received our customary flood
p266
aVof video protests and angry emails
p267
aVand even a package that had to be scanned by security,
p268
aVbut we have to remember
p269
aVpeople care intensely about this stuff,
p270
aVand it's because these products, this work,
p271
aVreally, really matters to them.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, we know that we have to be careful
p274
aVabout paying attention to the details,
p275
aVwe have to be cognizant about how we use data
p276
aVin our design process,
p277
aVand we have to introduce change
p278
aVvery, very carefully.
p279
aVNow, these things are all really useful.
p280
aVThey're good best practices for designing at scale.
p281
aVBut they don't mean anything
p282
aVif you don't understand something
p283
aVmuch more fundamental.
p284
aVYou have to understand who you are designing for.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, when you set a goal to design
p287
aVfor the entire human race,
p288
aVand you start to engage in that goal in earnest,
p289
aVat some point you run into the walls
p290
aVof the bubble that you're living in.
p291
aVNow, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed
p292
aVwhen we hit a dead cell zone
p293
aVbecause we can't use our phones to navigate
p294
aVto the new hipster coffee shop.
p295
aVBut what if you had to drive four hours
p296
aVto charge your phone
p297
aVbecause you had no reliable source of electricity?
p298
aVWhat if you had no access to public libraries?
p299
aVWhat if your country had no free press?
p300
aVWhat would these products start to mean to you?
p301
aVThis is what Google, YouTube and Facebook
p302
aVlook like to most of the world,
p303
aVand it's what they'll look like
p304
aVto most of the next five billion people
p305
aVto come online.
p306
aVDesigning for low-end cell phones
p307
aVis not glamorous design work,
p308
aVbut if you want to design for the whole world,
p309
aVyou have to design for where people are,
p310
aVand not where you are.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?
p313
aVWe try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear
p314
aVand understand the people we're designing for.
p315
aVWe use our products in non-English languages
p316
aVto make sure that they work just as well.
p317
aVAnd we try to use one of these phones from time to time
p318
aVto keep in touch with their reality.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo what does it mean to design at a global scale?
p321
aVIt means difficult and sometimes exasperating work
p322
aVto try to improve and evolve products.
p323
aVFinding the audacity and the humility to do right by them
p324
aVcan be pretty exhausting,
p325
aVand the humility part,
p326
aVit's a little tough on the design ego.
p327
aVBecause these products are always changing,
p328
aVeverything that I've designed in my career
p329
aVis pretty much gone,
p330
aVand everything that I will design will fade away.
p331
aVBut here's what remains:
p332
aVthe never-ending thrill
p333
aVof being a part of something that is so big,
p334
aVyou can hardly get your head around it,
p335
aVand the promise that it just might change the world.
