VI'm a neuroscientist,
p4
aVand I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,
p5
aVand our mission is to train the next generation of neuroscientists
p6
aVby taking graduate-level neuroscience research equipment
p7
aVand making it available for kids in middle schools and high schools.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd so when we go into the classroom,
p10
aVone way to get them thinking about the brain, which is very complex,
p11
aVis to ask them a very simple question about neuroscience,
p12
aVand that is, "What has a brain?"
p13
aVWhen we ask that,
p14
aVstudents will instantly tell you that their cat or dog has a brain,
p15
aVand most will say that a mouse or even a small insect has a brain,
p16
aVbut almost nobody says that a plant or a tree
p17
aVor a shrub has a brain.
p18
aVAnd so when you push \u2014
p19
aVbecause this could actually help describe a little bit
p20
aVhow the brain actually functions \u2014
p21
aVso you push and say,
p22
aV"Well, what is it that makes living things have brains versus not?"
p23
aVAnd often they'll come back with the classification
p24
aVthat things that move tend to have brains.
p25
aVAnd that's absolutely correct.
p26
aVOur nervous system evolved because it is electrical.
p27
aVIt's fast, so we can quickly respond to stimuli in the world
p28
aVand move if we need to.
p29
aVBut you can go back and push back on a student,
p30
aVand say, "Well, you know, you say that plants don't have brains,
p31
aVbut plants do move."
p32
aVAnyone who has grown a plant
p33
aVhas noticed that the plant will move
p34
aVand face the sun.
p35
aVBut they'll say, "But that's a slow movement.
p36
aVYou know, that doesn't count. That could be a chemical process."
p37
aVBut what about fast-moving plants?
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs, the Royal Governor of North Carolina,
p40
aVmade a pretty fascinating discovery.
p41
aVIn the swamps behind his house,
p42
aVhe found a plant that would spring shut
p43
aVevery time a bug would fall in between it.
p44
aVHe called this plant the flytrap,
p45
aVand within a decade, it made its way over to Europe,
p46
aVwhere eventually the great Charles Darwin got to study this plant,
p47
aVand this plant absolutely blew him away.
p48
aVHe called it the most wonderful plant in the world.
p49
aVThis is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder.
p50
aVThis is a plant that moves quickly,
p51
aVwhich is rare,
p52
aVand it's carnivorous, which is also rare.
p53
aVAnd this is in the same plant.
p54
aVBut I'm here today to tell you
p55
aVthat's not even the coolest thing about this plant.
p56
aVThe coolest thing is that the plant can count.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo in order to show that,
p59
aVwe have to get some vocabulary out of the way.
p60
aVSo I'm going to do what we do in the classroom with students.
p61
aVWe're going to do an experiment on electrophysiology,
p62
aVwhich is the recording of the body's electrical signal,
p63
aVeither coming from neurons or from muscles.
p64
aVAnd I'm putting some electrodes here on my wrists.
p65
aVAs I hook them up,
p66
aVwe're going to be able to see a signal
p67
aVon the screen here.
p68
aVAnd this signal may be familiar to you.
p69
aVIt's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram.
p70
aVAnd this is coming from neurons in my heart
p71
aVthat are firing what's called action potentials,
p72
aVpotential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down,
p73
aVwhich causes my heart to fire,
p74
aVwhich then causes the signal that you see here.
p75
aVAnd so I want you to remember the shape of what we'll be looking at right here,
p76
aVbecause this is going to be important.
p77
aVThis is a way that the brain encodes information
p78
aVin the form of an action potential.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo now let's turn to some plants.
p81
aVSo I'm going to first introduce you to the mimosa,
p82
aVnot the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,
p83
aVand this is a plant that's found in Central America and South America,
p84
aVand it has behaviors.
p85
aVAnd the first behavior I'm going to show you
p86
aVis if I touch the leaves here,
p87
aVyou get to see that the leaves tend to curl up.
p88
aVAnd then the second behavior is,
p89
aVif I tap the leaf,
p90
aVthe entire branch seems to fall down.
p91
aVSo why does it do that?
p92
aVIt's not really known to science.
p93
aVOne of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects
p94
aVor it looks less appealing to herbivores.
p95
aVBut how does it do that? Now, that's interesting.
p96
aVWe can do an experiment to find out.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo what we're going to do now,
p99
aVjust like I recorded the electrical potential from my body,
p100
aVwe're going to record the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa.
p101
aVAnd so what we're going to do is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,
p102
aVand I've got the ground electrode where?
p103
aVIn the ground. It's an electrical engineering joke. Alright.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VAlright. So I'm going to go ahead and tap the leaf here,
p108
aVand I want you to look at the electrical recording
p109
aVthat we're going to see inside the plant.
p110
aVWhoa. It is so big, I've got to scale it down.
p111
aVAlright. So what is that?
p112
aVThat is an action potential that is happening inside the plant.
p113
aVWhy was it happening?
p114
aVBecause it wanted to move. Right?
p115
aVAnd so when I hit the touch receptors,
p116
aVit sent a voltage all the way down to the end of the stem,
p117
aVwhich caused it to move.
p118
aVAnd now, in our arms, we would move our muscles,
p119
aVbut the plant doesn't have muscles.
p120
aVWhat it has is water inside the cells
p121
aVand when the voltage hits it, it opens up, releases the water,
p122
aVchanges the shape of the cells, and the leaf falls.
p123
aa(lp124
VOK. So here we see an action potential encoding information to move. Alright?
p125
aVBut can it do more?
p126
aVSo let's go to find out.
p127
aVWe're going to go to our good friend, the Venus flytrap here,
p128
aVand we're going to take a look at what happens inside the leaf
p129
aVwhen a fly lands on here.
p130
aVSo I'm going to pretend to be a fly right now.
p131
aVAnd now here's my Venus flytrap,
p132
aVand inside the leaf, you're going to notice
p133
aVthat there are three little hairs here, and those are trigger hairs.
p134
aVAnd so when a fly lands \u2014
p135
aVI'm going to touch one of the hairs right now.
p136
aVReady? One, two, three.
p137
aVWhat do we get? We get a beautiful action potential.
p138
aVHowever, the flytrap doesn't close.
p139
aVAnd to understand why that is,
p140
aVwe need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap.
p141
aVNumber one is that it takes a long time to open the traps back up \u2014
p142
aVyou know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it.
p143
aVAnd so it takes a lot of energy.
p144
aVAnd two, it doesn't need to eat that many flies throughout the year.
p145
aVOnly a handful. It gets most of its energy from the sun.
p146
aVIt's just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies.
p147
aVAnd the third thing is,
p148
aVit only opens then closes the traps a handful of times
p149
aVuntil that trap dies.
p150
aVSo therefore, it wants to make really darn sure
p151
aVthat there's a meal inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut.
p152
aVSo how does it do that?
p153
aVIt counts the number of seconds
p154
aVbetween successive touching of those hairs.
p155
aVAnd so the idea is that there's a high probability,
p156
aVif there's a fly inside of there, that it's going to be clicked together,
p157
aVand so when it gets the first action potential,
p158
aVit starts counting, one, two,
p159
aVand if it gets to 20 and it doesn't fire again,
p160
aVthen it's not going to close,
p161
aVbut if it does it within there, then the flytrap will close.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo we're going to go back now.
p164
aVI'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again.
p165
aVI've been talking for more than 20 seconds.
p166
aVSo we can see what happens when I touch the hair a second time.
p167
aVSo what do we get? We get a second action potential,
p168
aVbut again, the leaf doesn't close.
p169
aVSo now if I go back in there
p170
aVand if I'm a fly moving around,
p171
aVI'm going to be touching the leaf a few times.
p172
aVI'm going to go and brush it a few times.
p173
aVAnd immediately,
p174
aVthe flytrap closes.
p175
aVSo here we are seeing the flytrap actually doing a computation.
p176
aVIt's determining if there's a fly inside the trap,
p177
aVand then it closes.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo let's go back to our original question.
p180
aVDo plants have brains?
p181
aVWell, the answer is no.
p182
aVThere's no brains in here.
p183
aVThere's no axons, no neurons.
p184
aVIt doesn't get depressed.
p185
aVIt doesn't want to know what the Tigers' score is.
p186
aVIt doesn't have self-actualization problems.
p187
aVBut what it does have is something that's very similar to us,
p188
aVwhich is the ability to communicate using electricity.
p189
aVIt just uses slightly different ions than we do,
p190
aVbut it's actually doing the same thing.
p191
aVSo just to show you
p192
aVthe ubiquitous nature of these action potentials,
p193
aVwe saw it in the Venus flytrap,
p194
aVwe've seen an action potential in the mimosa.
p195
aVWe've even seen an action potential in a human.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, this is the euro of the brain.
p198
aVIt's the way that all information is passed.
p199
aVAnd so what we can do is we can use those action potentials
p200
aVto pass information
p201
aVbetween species of plants.
p202
aVAnd so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator,
p203
aVand what we've done is we've created a brand new experiment
p204
aVwhere we're going to record the action potential from a Venus flytrap,
p205
aVand we're going to send it into the sensitive mimosa.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo I want you to recall what happens
p208
aVwhen we touch the leaves of the mimosa.
p209
aVIt has touch receptors that are sending that information
p210
aVback down in the form of an action potential.
p211
aVAnd so what would happen
p212
aVif we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap
p213
aVand sent it into all the stems of the mimosa?
p214
aVWe should be able to create the behavior of the mimosas
p215
aVwithout actually touching it ourselves.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd so if you'll allow me,
p218
aVI'm going to go ahead and trigger this mimosa right now
p219
aVby touching on the hairs of the Venus flytrap.
p220
aVSo we're going to send information about touch from one plant to another.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo there you see it.
p223
aVSo \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VSo I hope you learned a little bit, something about plants today,
p228
aVand not only that.
p229
aVYou learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience
p230
aVand bring along the neurorevolution.
p231
aa(lp232
VThank you.
