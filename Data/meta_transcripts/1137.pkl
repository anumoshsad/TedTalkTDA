VGood afternoon, everybody.
p4
aVI've got something to show you.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVThink about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.
p7
aVThis is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.
p8
aVLet me tell you a bit about it.
p9
aVNow if you take this picture \u2014 I'm Italian originally,
p10
aVand every boy in Italy grows up
p11
aVwith this picture on the wall of his bedroom \u2014
p12
aVbut the reason I'm showing you this
p13
aVis that something very interesting
p14
aVhappened in Formula 1 racing
p15
aVover the past couple of decades.
p16
aVNow some time ago,
p17
aVif you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,
p18
aVyou take a budget, and you bet your budget
p19
aVon a good driver and a good car.
p20
aVAnd if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.
p21
aVNow today, if you want to win the race,
p22
aVactually you need also something like this \u2014
p23
aVsomething that monitors the car in real time,
p24
aVhas a few thousand sensors
p25
aVcollecting information from the car,
p26
aVtransmitting this information into the system,
p27
aVand then processing it
p28
aVand using it in order to go back to the car with decisions
p29
aVand changing things in real time
p30
aVas information is collected.
p31
aVThis is what, in engineering terms,
p32
aVyou would call a real time control system.
p33
aVAnd basically, it's a system made of two components \u2014
p34
aVa sensing and an actuating component.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat is interesting today
p37
aVis that real time control systems
p38
aVare starting to enter into our lives.
p39
aVOur cities, over the past few years,
p40
aVjust have been blanketed
p41
aVwith networks, electronics.
p42
aVThey're becoming like computers in open air.
p43
aVAnd, as computers in open air,
p44
aVthey're starting to respond in a different way
p45
aVto be able to be sensed and to be actuated.
p46
aVIf we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.
p47
aVJust as an aside, I wanted to mention,
p48
aVcities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,
p49
aVbut they are 50 percent of the world's population.
p50
aVThey are 75 percent of the energy consumption \u2014
p51
aVup to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
p52
aVSo if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.
p53
aVBeyond cities,
p54
aVall of this sensing and actuating
p55
aVis entering our everyday objects.
p56
aa(lp57
VThat's from an exhibition that
p58
aVPaola Antonelli is organizing
p59
aVat MoMA later this year, during the summer.
p60
aVIt's called "Talk to Me."
p61
aVWell our objects, our environment
p62
aVis starting to talk back to us.
p63
aVIn a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there
p64
aVwere becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
p65
aVAnd that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans
p66
aVwith the environment out there.
p67
aVIn a certain sense,
p68
aVit's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
p69
aVyou know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,
p70
aVat the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses \u2014
p71
aVactually you can still see a small chip underneath \u2014
p72
aVand said, shouted,
p73
aV"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"
p74
aVWell today, for the first time,
p75
aVour environment is starting to talk back to us.
p76
aVAnd I'll show just a few examples \u2014
p77
aVagain, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.
p78
aa(lp79
VLet's starting with sensing.
p80
aVWell, the first project I wanted to share with you
p81
aVis actually one of the first projects by our lab.
p82
aVIt was four and a half years ago in Italy.
p83
aVAnd what we did there
p84
aVwas actually use a new type of network at the time
p85
aVthat had been deployed all across the world \u2014
p86
aVthat's a cellphone network \u2014
p87
aVand use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,
p88
aVthat's collected anyway by the operator,
p89
aVin order to understand
p90
aVhow the city works.
p91
aVThe summer was a lucky summer \u2014 2006.
p92
aVIt's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.
p93
aVSome of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,
p94
aVand then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.
p95
aVAnd anyway, Italy won at the end.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VNow look at what happened that day
p100
aVjust by monitoring activity
p101
aVhappening on the network.
p102
aVHere you see the city.
p103
aVYou see the Colosseum in the middle,
p104
aVthe river Tiber.
p105
aVIt's morning, before the match.
p106
aVYou see the timeline on the top.
p107
aVEarly afternoon,
p108
aVpeople here and there,
p109
aVmaking calls and moving.
p110
aVThe match begins \u2014 silence.
p111
aVFrance scores. Italy scores.
p112
aVHalftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
p113
aVSecond half. End of normal time.
p114
aVFirst overtime, second.
p115
aVZidane, the headbutt in a moment.
p116
aVItaly wins. Yeah.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aVWell, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.
p120
aVYou saw the big peak.
p121
aVThe following day, again everybody went to the center
p122
aVto meet the winning team
p123
aVand the prime minister at the time.
p124
aVAnd then everybody moved down.
p125
aVYou see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,
p126
aVwhere, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,
p127
aVto have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.
p128
aVWell, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today
p129
aVin a way that we couldn't have done
p130
aVjust a few years ago.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnother quick example about sensing:
p133
aVit's not about people,
p134
aVbut about things we use and consume.
p135
aVWell today, we know everything
p136
aVabout where our objects come from.
p137
aVThis is a map that shows you
p138
aVall the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
p139
aVBut we know very little about where things go.
p140
aVSo in this project,
p141
aVwe actually developed some small tags
p142
aVto track trash as it moves through the system.
p143
aVSo we actually started with a number of volunteers
p144
aVwho helped us in Seattle,
p145
aVjust over a year ago,
p146
aVto tag what they were throwing away \u2014
p147
aVdifferent types of things, as you can see here \u2014
p148
aVthings they would throw away anyway.
p149
aVThen we put a little chip, little tag,
p150
aVonto the trash
p151
aVand then started following it.
p152
aVHere are the results we just obtained.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Music)
p155
aa(lp156
VFrom Seattle ...
p157
aVafter one week.
p158
aVWith this information we realized
p159
aVthere's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.
p160
aVWe can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
p161
aVThis data was not available before.
p162
aVBut there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
p163
aVBut the other thing is that we believe
p164
aVthat if we see every day
p165
aVthat the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,
p166
aVit's still somewhere on the planet.
p167
aVAnd the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.
p168
aVAnd if we show that to people,
p169
aVthen we can also promote some behavioral change.
p170
aVSo that was the reason for the project.
p171
aa(lp172
VMy colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,
p173
aVhe could tell you much more about sensing
p174
aVand many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,
p175
aVbut I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,
p176
aVand that's actuating our environment.
p177
aVAnd the first project
p178
aVis something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
p179
aVIt started with a question by the mayor of the city,
p180
aVwho came to us saying
p181
aVthat Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition
p182
aVof using water in public space, in architecture.
p183
aVAnd the question was: How could technology, new technology,
p184
aVbe added to that?
p185
aVAnd one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop
p186
aVwas, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,
p187
aVsolenoid valves, taps,
p188
aVopening and closing.
p189
aVYou create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.
p190
aVIf those pixels fall,
p191
aVyou can write on it,
p192
aVyou can show patterns, images, text.
p193
aVAnd even you can approach it, and it will open up
p194
aVto let you jump through,
p195
aVas you see in this image.
p196
aa(lp197
VWell, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.
p198
aVHe liked it very much.
p199
aVAnd we got a commission to design a building
p200
aVat the entrance of the expo.
p201
aVWe called it Digital Water Pavilion.
p202
aVThe whole building is made of water.
p203
aVThere's no doors or windows,
p204
aVbut when you approach it,
p205
aVit will open up to let you in.
p206
aV(Music)
p207
aVThe roof also is covered with water.
p208
aVAnd if there's a bit of wind,
p209
aVif you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
p210
aVOr you could close the building,
p211
aVand the whole architecture will disappear,
p212
aVlike in this case.
p213
aVYou know, these days, you always get images during the winter,
p214
aVwhen they take the roof down,
p215
aVof people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
p216
aVNo, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,
p217
aVthe architecture almost disappears.
p218
aVHere's the building working.
p219
aVYou see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.
p220
aVAnd here was myself trying not to get wet,
p221
aVtesting the sensors that open the water.
p222
aa(lp223
VWell, I should tell you now what happened one night
p224
aVwhen all of the sensors stopped working.
p225
aVBut actually that night, it was even more fun.
p226
aVAll the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,
p227
aVbecause the way of engaging with the building became something different.
p228
aVNot anymore a building that would open up to let you in,
p229
aVbut a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,
p230
aVand you had to jump without getting wet.
p231
aa(lp232
V(Video) (Crowd Noise)
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd that was, for us, was very interesting,
p235
aVbecause, as architects, as engineers, as designers,
p236
aVwe always think about how people will use the things we design.
p237
aVBut then reality's always unpredictable.
p238
aVAnd that's the beauty of doing things
p239
aVthat are used and interact with people.
p240
aa(lp241
VHere is an image then of the building
p242
aVwith the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,
p243
aVand then projections on them.
p244
aVAnd this is what led us to think about
p245
aVthe following project I'll show you now.
p246
aVThat's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.
p247
aVImagine you could have small helicopters
p248
aVthat move in the air,
p249
aVand then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights \u2014
p250
aValmost as a cloud that can move in space.
p251
aVHere is the video.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Music)
p254
aa(lp255
VSo imagine one helicopter,
p256
aVlike the one we saw before,
p257
aVmoving with others,
p258
aVin synchrony.
p259
aVSo you can have this cloud.
p260
aVYou can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this \u2014
p261
aVa regular configuration in two dimensions.
p262
aVOr in regular, but in three dimensions,
p263
aVwhere the thing that changes is the light,
p264
aVnot the pixels' position.
p265
aVYou can play with a different type.
p266
aVImagine your screen could just appear
p267
aVin different scales or sizes,
p268
aVdifferent types of resolution.
p269
aVBut then the whole thing can be
p270
aVjust a 3D cloud of pixels
p271
aVthat you can approach and move through it
p272
aVand see from many, many directions.
p273
aVHere is the real Flyfire
p274
aVcontrol and going down to form the regular grid as before.
p275
aVWhen you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.
p276
aVAnd imagine each of them then controlled by people.
p277
aVYou can have each pixel
p278
aVhaving an input that comes from people,
p279
aVfrom people's movement, or so and so.
p280
aa(lp281
VI want to show you something here for the first time.
p282
aVWe've been working with Roberto Bolle,
p283
aVone of today's top ballet dancers \u2014
p284
aVthe étoile at Metropolitan in New York
p285
aVand La Scala in Milan \u2014
p286
aVand actually captured his movement in 3D
p287
aVin order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
p288
aVAnd here you can see Roberto dancing.
p289
aVYou see on the left the pixels,
p290
aVthe different resolutions being captured.
p291
aVIt's both 3D scanning in real time
p292
aVand motion capture.
p293
aVSo you can reconstruct a whole movement.
p294
aVYou can go all the way through.
p295
aVBut then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them
p296
aVand play with color and movement
p297
aVand gravity and rotation.
p298
aVSo we want to use this as one of the possible inputs
p299
aVfor Flyfire.
p300
aa(lp301
VI wanted to show you the last project we are working on.
p302
aVIt's something we're working on for the London Olympics.
p303
aVIt's called The Cloud.
p304
aVAnd the idea here is, imagine, again,
p305
aVwe can involve people
p306
aVin doing something and changing our environment \u2014
p307
aValmost to impart what we call cloud raising \u2014
p308
aVlike barn raising, but with a cloud.
p309
aVImagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.
p310
aVAnd I think what is remarkable
p311
aVthat has happened over the past couple of years
p312
aVis that, over the past couple of decades,
p313
aVwe went from the physical world to the digital one.
p314
aVThis has been digitizing everything, knowledge,
p315
aVand making that accessible through the Internet.
p316
aa(lp317
VNow today, for the first time \u2014
p318
aVand the Obama campaign showed us this \u2014
p319
aVwe can go from the digital world,
p320
aVfrom the self-organizing power of networks,
p321
aVto the physical one.
p322
aVThis can be, in our case,
p323
aVwe want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.
p324
aVThat means something built in a city.
p325
aVBut tomorrow it can be,
p326
aVin order to tackle today's pressing challenges \u2014
p327
aVthink about climate change or CO2 emissions \u2014
p328
aVhow we can go from the digital world to the physical one.
p329
aVSo the idea that we can actually involve people
p330
aVin doing this thing together, collectively.
p331
aa(lp332
VThe cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,
p333
aVin the same way as the real cloud
p334
aVis a cloud made of particles.
p335
aVAnd those particles are water,
p336
aVwhere our cloud is a cloud of pixels.
p337
aVIt's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.
p338
aVYou can move inside, have different types of experiences.
p339
aVYou can actually see from underneath,
p340
aVsharing the main moments
p341
aVfor the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,
p342
aVand really using it as a way to connect with the community.
p343
aVSo both the physical cloud in the sky
p344
aVand something you can go to the top [of],
p345
aVlike London's new mountaintop.
p346
aVYou can enter inside it.
p347
aVAnd a kind of new digital beacon for the night \u2014
p348
aVbut most importantly,
p349
aVa new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.
p350
