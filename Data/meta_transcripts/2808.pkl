VMy name is Katrina Spade, and I grew up in a medical family
p4
aVwhere it was fairly normal to talk about death and dying at the dinner table.
p5
aVBut I didn't go into medicine like so many of my family members.
p6
aVInstead, I went to architecture school to learn how to design.
p7
aVAnd while I was there, I began to be curious
p8
aVabout what would happen to my physical body after I died.
p9
aVWhat would my nearest and dearest do with me?
p10
aa(lp11
VSo if the existence and the fact of your own mortality
p12
aVdoesn't get you down,
p13
aVthe state of our current funerary practices will.
p14
aVToday, almost 50 percent of Americans choose conventional burial.
p15
aVConventional burial begins with embalming,
p16
aVwhere funeral staff drain bodily fluid
p17
aVand replace it with a mixture designed to preserve the corpse
p18
aVand give it a lifelike glow.
p19
aVThen, as you know, bodies are buried in a casket
p20
aVin a concrete-lined grave
p21
aVin a cemetery.
p22
aVAll told, in US cemeteries,
p23
aVwe bury enough metal to build a Golden Gate Bridge,
p24
aVenough wood to build 1,800 single family homes,
p25
aVand enough formaldehyde-laden embalming fluid
p26
aVto fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.
p27
aa(lp28
VIn addition, cemeteries all over the world are reaching capacity.
p29
aVTurns out, it doesn't really make good business sense
p30
aVto sell someone a piece of land for eternity.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VWhose idea was that?
p35
aa(lp36
VIn some places, you can't buy a plot no matter how much money you have.
p37
aVAs a result, cremation rates have risen fast.
p38
aVIn 1950, if you suggested your grandmother be incinerated after she died,
p39
aVyou'd probably be kicked from the family deathbed.
p40
aVBut today, almost half of Americans choose cremation,
p41
aVciting simpler,
p42
aVcheaper
p43
aVand more ecological as reasons.
p44
aVI used to think that cremation was a sustainable form of disposition,
p45
aVbut just think about it for a second.
p46
aVCremation destroys the potential we have
p47
aVto give back to the earth after we've died.
p48
aVIt uses an energy-intensive process to turn bodies into ash,
p49
aVpolluting the air and contributing to climate change.
p50
aVAll told, cremations in the US
p51
aVemit a staggering 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide
p52
aVinto the atmosphere annually.
p53
aVThe truly awful truth
p54
aVis that the very last thing that most of us will do on this earth
p55
aVis poison it.
p56
aa(lp57
VIt's like we've created, accepted and death-denied our way into a status quo
p58
aVthat puts as much distance between ourselves and nature
p59
aVas is humanly possible.
p60
aVOur modern funerary practices are designed to stave off
p61
aVthe natural processes that happen to a body after death.
p62
aVIn other words, they're meant to prevent us from decomposing.
p63
aVBut the truth
p64
aVis that nature is really, really good at death.
p65
aVWe've all seen it.
p66
aVWhen organic material dies in nature,
p67
aVmicrobes and bacteria break it down into nutrient-rich soil,
p68
aVcompleting the life cycle.
p69
aVIn nature, death creates life.
p70
aa(lp71
VBack in architecture school, I was thinking about all this,
p72
aVand I set out on a plan to redesign death care.
p73
aVCould I create a system
p74
aVthat was beneficial to the earth
p75
aVand that used nature as a guide rather than something to be feared?
p76
aVSomething that was gentle to the planet?
p77
aVThat planet, after all, supports our living bodies
p78
aVour whole lives.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd while I was mulling this all over
p81
aVover the drawing board,
p82
aVthe phone rang.
p83
aVIt was my friend Kate.
p84
aVShe was like, "Hey, have you heard about the farmers
p85
aVwho are composting whole cows?"
p86
aVAnd I was like, "Mmmm."
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VTurns out that farmers in agricultural institutions
p91
aVhave been practicing something called livestock mortality composting
p92
aVfor decades.
p93
aVMortality composting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen
p94
aVand cover it with co-composting materials that are high in carbon.
p95
aVIt's an aerobic process, so it requires oxygen,
p96
aVand it requires plenty of moisture as well.
p97
aVIn the most basic setup, a cow is covered with a few feet of wood chips,
p98
aVwhich are high in carbon,
p99
aVand left outside for nature, for breezes to provide oxygen
p100
aVand rain to provide moisture.
p101
aVIn about nine months,
p102
aVall that remains is a nutrient-rich compost.
p103
aVThe flesh has been decomposed entirely,
p104
aVas have the bones.
p105
aVI know.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VSo I would definitely call myself a decomposition nerd,
p110
aVbut I am far, far from a scientist,
p111
aVand one way you can tell this is true
p112
aVis that I have often called the process of composting "magic."
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VSo basically, all we humans need to do
p117
aVis create the right environment for nature to do its job.
p118
aVIt's like the opposite of antibacterial soap.
p119
aVInstead of fighting them,
p120
aVwe welcome microbes and bacteria in with open arms.
p121
aVThese tiny, amazing creatures
p122
aVbreak down molecules into smaller molecules and atoms,
p123
aVwhich are then incorporated into new molecules.
p124
aVIn other words, that cow is transformed.
p125
aVIt's no longer a cow.
p126
aVIt's been cycled back into nature.
p127
aVSee? Magic.
p128
aa(lp129
VYou can probably imagine the light bulb that went off in my head
p130
aVafter I received that phone call.
p131
aVI began designing a system
p132
aVbased on the principles of livestock mortality composting
p133
aVthat would take human beings and transform them into soil.
p134
aa(lp135
VFast-forward five years
p136
aVand the project has grown in ways I truly never could have imagined.
p137
aVWe've created a scalable, replicable non-profit urban model
p138
aVbased on the science of livestock mortality composting
p139
aVthat turns human beings into soil.
p140
aVWe've partnered and collaborated with experts in soil science,
p141
aVdecomposition, alternative death care,
p142
aVlaw and architecture.
p143
aVWe've raised funds from foundations and individuals
p144
aVin order to design a prototype of this system,
p145
aVand we've heard from tens of thousands of people all over the world
p146
aVwho want this option to be available.
p147
aVOK.
p148
aVIn the next few years,
p149
aVit's our goal to build the first full-scale human composting facility
p150
aVright in the city of Seattle.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VImagine it,
p155
aVpart public park,
p156
aVpart funeral home,
p157
aVpart memorial to the people we love,
p158
aVa place where we can reconnect with the cycles of nature
p159
aVand treat bodies with gentleness and respect.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe infrastructure is simple.
p162
aVInside a vertical core,
p163
aVbodies and wood chips undergo accelerated natural decomposition,
p164
aVor composting,
p165
aVand are transformed into soil.
p166
aVWhen someone dies, their body is taken to a human composting facility.
p167
aVAfter wrapping the deceased in a simple shroud,
p168
aVfriends and family carry the body to the top of the core,
p169
aVwhich contains the natural decomposition system.
p170
aVDuring a laying in ceremony,
p171
aVthey gently place the body into the core
p172
aVand cover it with wood chips.
p173
aVThis begins the gentle transformation from human to soil.
p174
aVOver the next few weeks, the body decomposes naturally.
p175
aVMicrobes and bacteria break down carbon, then protein,
p176
aVto create a new substance,
p177
aVa rich, earthy soil.
p178
aVThis soil can then be used to grow new life.
p179
aVEventually, you could be a lemon tree.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VYeah, thank you.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VWho's thinking about lemon meringue pie right now?
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VA lemon drop?
p192
aVSomething stronger?
p193
aa(lp194
VSo in addition to housing the core,
p195
aVthese buildings will function to support the grieving
p196
aVby providing space for memorial services and end-of-life planning.
p197
aVThe potential for repurposing is huge.
p198
aVOld churches and industrial warehouses can be converted into places
p199
aVwhere we create soil and honor life.
p200
aa(lp201
VWe want to bring back the aspect of ritual
p202
aVthat's been diluted over the past hundred years
p203
aVas cremation rates have risen
p204
aVand religious affiliation has declined.
p205
aVOur Seattle facility will function as a model for these places
p206
aVall over the world.
p207
aVWe've heard from communities in South Africa, Australia,
p208
aVthe UK, Canada and beyond.
p209
aVWe're creating a design toolkit
p210
aVthat will help others design and build facilities
p211
aVthat will contain technical specifications
p212
aVand regulatory best practices.
p213
aVWe want to help individuals, organizations,
p214
aVand down the road, municipalities
p215
aVdesign and build facilities in their own cities.
p216
aVThe idea is that every one of these places should look and feel completely different
p217
aVwith the same system inside.
p218
aVThey're really meant to be designed for the neighborhood in which they reside
p219
aVand the community which they serve.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe other idea is for supportive staff to be on hand
p222
aVto help families with the care and preparation of loved ones' bodies.
p223
aVWe're banishing practices that bewilder and disempower
p224
aVand creating a system that is beautiful and meaningful
p225
aVand transparent.
p226
aVWe believe that access to ecological death care
p227
aVis a human right.
p228
aa(lp229
VOK, so you know the old saying,
p230
aVif you can compost a cow, you can compost a human?
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
VTurns out, it's true.
p235
aVSince 2014, we've been running a pilot project
p236
aVin the hills of North Carolina
p237
aVwith the Forensic Anthropology Department at Western Carolina University.
p238
aVSix donor bodies have been covered in wood chips,
p239
aVoxygen provided by breezes,
p240
aVmicrobes and bacteria doing their jobs.
p241
aVThis pilot program has allowed us to demonstrate that it's possible
p242
aVto harness the incredible power of natural decomposition
p243
aVto turn human bodies into soil,
p244
aVand we're working with other universities as well.
p245
aVSoil scientists at Washington State University,
p246
aVthe grad students, anyway,
p247
aVare working to compost teeth with amalgam fillings
p248
aVso that we can understand what happens to the mercury therein.
p249
aVNext up, we'll be beginning experiments
p250
aVto determine what happens to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals
p251
aVduring the composting process,
p252
aVand whether additional remediation will be needed.
p253
aa(lp254
VBy the way,
p255
aVcomposting creates a great deal of heat,
p256
aVespecially this particular type of composting.
p257
aVOne week after we began composting our fifth donor body,
p258
aVthe temperature inside that mound of wood chips
p259
aVreached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.
p260
aVImagine harnessing that heat to create energy
p261
aVor comfort the grieving on a cold day.
p262
aa(lp263
VThe death care revolution has begun.
p264
aVIt's an exciting time to be alive.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
