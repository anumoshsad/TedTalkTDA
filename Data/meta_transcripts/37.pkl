VCharles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica,
p4
aVsaid the ideal encyclopedia should be radical \u2014
p5
aVit should stop being safe.
p6
aVBut if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962,
p7
aVit was anything but radical:
p8
aVstill a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia.
p9
aVWikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea,
p10
aVand that's for all of us to imagine a world
p11
aVin which every single person on the planet
p12
aVis given free access to the sum of all human knowledge.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd that's what we're doing.
p15
aVSo Wikipedia \u2014
p16
aVyou just saw the little demonstration of it \u2014
p17
aVit's a freely licensed encyclopedia.
p18
aVIt's written by thousands of volunteers
p19
aVall over the world in many, many languages.
p20
aVIt's written using wiki software \u2014
p21
aVwhich is the type of software he just demonstrated \u2014
p22
aVso anyone can quickly edit and save,
p23
aVand it goes live on the Internet immediately.
p24
aVAnd everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff.
p25
aVSo when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization,
p26
aVhe's exactly describing Wikipedia.
p27
aVAnd what I'm going to do today
p28
aVis tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation,
p31
aVwhich I founded,
p32
aVa nonprofit organization.
p33
aVAnd our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation,
p34
aVis to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
p35
aVAnd so, if you think about what that means,
p36
aVit means a lot more than just building a cool website.
p37
aVWe're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide,
p38
aVpoverty worldwide,
p39
aVempowering people everywhere to have the information that they need
p40
aVto make good decisions.
p41
aVAnd so we're going to have to do a lot of work
p42
aVthat goes beyond just the Internet.
p43
aVAnd so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model,
p44
aVbecause that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to \u2014
p45
aVthey can take our content and do anything they like with it \u2014
p46
aVyou can copy it, redistribute it \u2014
p47
aVand you can do it commercially or non-commercially.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia
p50
aVall over the world.
p51
aVWe're funded by donations from the public,
p52
aVand one of the more interesting things about that
p53
aVis how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia.
p54
aVSo Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was.
p55
aVAnd I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is.
p56
aVBut first, I'll show you how big it is.
p57
aVSo we've got over 600,000 articles in English.
p58
aVWe've got two million total articles across many, many different languages.
p59
aVThe biggest languages are German, Japanese, French \u2014
p60
aVall the Western-European languages are quite big.
p61
aVBut only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web
p62
aVclusters to the English Wikipedia,
p63
aVwhich is surprising to a lot of people.
p64
aVA lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet,
p65
aVbut for us, we're truly global.
p66
aVWe're in many, many languages.
p67
aVHow popular we've gotten to be \u2014 we're a top-50 website
p68
aVand we're more popular than the New York Times.
p69
aVSo this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.
p70
aa(lp71
VThis shows the growth of Wikipedia \u2014 we're the blue line there \u2014
p72
aVand this is the New York Times over there.
p73
aVAnd what's interesting about this
p74
aVis the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation
p75
aVwith I have no idea how many hundreds of employees.
p76
aVWe have exactly one employee,
p77
aVand that employee is our lead software developer.
p78
aVAnd he's only been our employee since January 2005,
p79
aVall the other growth before that ...
p80
aVSo the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers.
p81
aVAll the editing is done by volunteers.
p82
aVAnd the way that we're organized
p83
aVis not like any traditional organization you can imagine.
p84
aVPeople are always asking, "Well, who's in charge of this?"
p85
aVor "Who does that?"
p86
aVAnd the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in.
p87
aVIt's a very unusual and chaotic thing.
p88
aVWe've got over 90 servers now in three locations.
p89
aVThese are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online.
p90
aVI can go online any time of the day or night
p91
aVand see eight to 10 people waiting for me
p92
aVto ask a question or something, anything about the servers.
p93
aVYou could never afford to do this in a company.
p94
aVYou could never afford
p95
aVto have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day
p96
aVand do what we're doing at Wikipedia.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly,
p99
aVso it's really gotten to be a huge thing.
p100
aVAnd everything is managed by the volunteers.
p101
aVAnd the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.
p102
aVAnd that's essentially our main cost.
p103
aVWe could actually do without the employee.
p104
aVWe hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years
p105
aVand full-time at Wikipedia,
p106
aVso we actually hired him,
p107
aVso he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.
p108
aVSo the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is,
p109
aVwhy isn't it all rubbish?
p110
aVWhy is the website as good as it is?
p111
aa(lp112
VFirst of all, how good is it?
p113
aVWell, it's pretty good.
p114
aVIt isn't perfect,
p115
aVbut it's much better than you would expect,
p116
aVgiven our completely chaotic model.
p117
aVSo when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me,
p118
aVyou think, "Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish."
p119
aVBut when we've seen quality tests \u2014
p120
aVand there haven't been enough of these yet
p121
aVand I'm really encouraging people to do more,
p122
aVcomparing Wikipedia to traditional things \u2014
p123
aVwe win hands down.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo a German magazine compared German Wikipedia,
p126
aVwhich is much, much smaller than English,
p127
aVto Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial,
p128
aVand we won across the board.
p129
aVThey hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality,
p130
aVand we were very pleased with that result.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.
p133
aVThe media has covered this somewhat extensively.
p134
aVIt started out with an article in Red Herring.
p135
aVThe reporters called me up and they \u2014
p136
aVI mean, I have to say they spelled my name right,
p137
aVbut they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,
p138
aVit's tearing apart the Wikipedia community.
p139
aVAnd so they quote me as saying,
p140
aV"They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia."
p141
aVWhat I actually said is they're not contentious at all.
p142
aVSo it's a slight misquote.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VThe articles were edited quite heavily.
p147
aVAnd it is true that we did have to lock the articles
p148
aVon a couple of occasions.
p149
aVTime magazine recently reported that
p150
aV"Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,
p151
aVand Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."
p152
aVThis came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for \u2014
p153
aVoccasionally a little bit here and there.
p154
aVSo the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies
p155
aVthat you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community
p156
aVare not really controversies at all.
p157
aa(lp158
VArticles on controversial topics are edited a lot,
p159
aVbut they don't cause much controversy within the community.
p160
aVAnd the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality.
p161
aVThe real struggle is not between the right and the left \u2014
p162
aVthat's where most people assume \u2014
p163
aVbut it's between the party of the thoughtful
p164
aVand the party of the jerks.
p165
aVAnd no side of the political spectrum
p166
aVhas a monopoly on either of those qualities.
p167
aVThe actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident
p168
aVis that the Bush-Kerry articles
p169
aVwere locked less than one percent of the time in 2004,
p170
aVand it wasn't because they were contentious;
p171
aVit was just because there was routine vandalism \u2014
p172
aVwhich happens sometimes even on stage ...
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VSometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia
p177
aVand were amazed that it was fixed so quickly.
p178
aVAnd I said \u2014 you know, I always say, please don't do that.
p179
aVThat's not a good thing.
p180
aVSo how do we do this?
p181
aVHow do we manage the quality control?
p182
aVHow does it work?
p183
aa(lp184
VSo there's a few elements,
p185
aVmostly social policies and some elements of the software.
p186
aVSo the biggest and the most important thing
p187
aVis our neutral point of view policy.
p188
aVThis is something that I set down, from the very beginning,
p189
aVas a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable.
p190
aVIt's a social concept of cooperation,
p191
aVso we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity.
p192
aVThe reason for this is if we say
p193
aVwe're only going to write the "truth" about some topic,
p194
aVthat doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write,
p195
aVbecause I don't agree with you about what's the truth.
p196
aVBut we have this jargon term of neutrality,
p197
aVwhich has its own long history within the community,
p198
aVwhich basically says, any time there's a controversial issue,
p199
aVWikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.
p200
aVWe should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.
p201
aVSo this neutrality policy is really important for us
p202
aVbecause it empowers a community that is very diverse
p203
aVto come together and actually get some work done.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we have very diverse contributors
p206
aVin terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds.
p207
aVBy having this firm neutrality policy,
p208
aVwhich is non-negotiable from the beginning,
p209
aVwe ensure that people can work together
p210
aVand that the entries don't become simply a war
p211
aVback and forth between the left and the right.
p212
aVIf you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo, real-time peer review.
p215
aVEvery single change on the site goes to the "Recent changes" page.
p216
aVSo as soon as he made his change, it went to the "Recent changes" page.
p217
aVThat recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel,
p218
aVwhich is an Internet chat channel
p219
aVthat people are monitoring with various software tools.
p220
aVAnd people can get RSS feeds \u2014
p221
aVthey can get email notifications of changes.
p222
aVAnd then users can set up their own personal watch list.
p223
aVSo my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists,
p224
aVbecause it is sometimes vandalized.
p225
aVAnd therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly,
p226
aVand then they'll just simply revert the change.
p227
aa(lp228
VThere's a "new pages feed," for example,
p229
aVso you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia
p230
aVand see every new page as it's created.
p231
aVThis is really important
p232
aVbecause a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted,
p233
aVyou know, "ASDFASDF."
p234
aVBut also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things,
p235
aVsome of the new articles.
p236
aVPeople will start an article on some interesting topic,
p237
aVother people will find that intriguing
p238
aVand jump in and help and make it much better.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo we do have edits by anonymous users,
p241
aVwhich is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia.
p242
aVSo, Chris was able to do his change \u2014 he didn't have to log in or anything;
p243
aVhe just went on the website and made a change.
p244
aVBut it turns out that only about 18 percent
p245
aVof all the edits to the website
p246
aVare done by anonymous users.
p247
aVAnd that's a really important thing to understand:
p248
aVthe vast majority of the edits that go on on the website
p249
aVare from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people
p250
aVwho are in constant communication.
p251
aVAnd we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists.
p252
aVAll these people know each other.
p253
aVThey communicate. We have off-line meetings.
p254
aa(lp255
VThese are the people who are doing the bulk of the site,
p256
aVand they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing.
p257
aVThe standards we set for ourselves
p258
aVare equal to or higher than professional standards of quality.
p259
aVWe don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd so that tight community is who really cares for the site,
p262
aVand these are some of the smartest people I've ever met.
p263
aVIt's my job to say that, but it's actually true.
p264
aVThe type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun
p265
aVtend to be pretty smart people.
p266
aa(lp267
VThe tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us \u2014
p268
aVallow us, meaning the community \u2014
p269
aVto self-monitor and to monitor all the work.
p270
aVThis is an example of a page history on "flat Earth,"
p271
aVand you can see some changes that were made.
p272
aVWhat's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this
p273
aVand see, "OK, I understand now."
p274
aVWhen somebody goes and looks at \u2014
p275
aVthey see that someone, an anonymous IP number,
p276
aVmade an edit to my page.
p277
aVThat sounds suspicious. Who is this person?
p278
aVSomebody looks at it \u2014
p279
aVthey can immediately see highlighted in red
p280
aVall of the changes that took place \u2014
p281
aVto see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.
p282
aVSo that's one tool that we can use
p283
aVto very quickly monitor the history of a page.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnother thing that we do within the community
p286
aVis we leave everything very open-ended.
p287
aVMost of the social rules and the methods of work
p288
aVare left completely open-ended in the software.
p289
aVAll of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
p290
aVAnd so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules.
p291
aVThe example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page.
p292
aVSo, I mentioned earlier, people type "ASDFASDF" \u2014
p293
aVit needs to be deleted.
p294
aVCases like that, the administrators just delete it.
p295
aVThere's no reason to have a big argument about it.
p296
aVBut you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is,
p297
aVis this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia?
p298
aVIs the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?
p299
aVSo we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this.
p300
aVAnd so the method that arose organically within the community
p301
aVis the Votes For Deletion page.
p302
aVAnd in the particular example we have here,
p303
aVit's a film, "Twisted Issues,"
p304
aVand the first person says,
p305
aV"Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably."
p306
aVThe Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there,
p307
aVbecause if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all.
p308
aVIt's not a perfect rule,
p309
aVbut it's a nice starting point for quick research.
p310
aVSo somebody says, "Delete it, please. Delete it \u2014 it's not notable."
p311
aVAnd then somebody says, "Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,
p312
aV'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"
p313
aVSo the next persons says, "Clean it up."
p314
aVSomebody says, "I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep."
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd what's interesting about this is that the software is \u2014
p317
aVthese votes are just text typed into a page.
p318
aVThis is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue.
p319
aVNow it is true that at the end of the day,
p320
aVan administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say,
p321
aV"OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it."
p322
aVBut in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,
p323
aVand we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say,
p324
aV"Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book,
p325
aVand I found a link to a page that describes it,
p326
aVand I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,"
p327
aVthen it would survive.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd it also matters who the people are who are voting.
p330
aVLike I say, it's a tight-knit community.
p331
aVDown here at the bottom, "Keep, real movie," RickK.
p332
aVRickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work
p333
aVwith vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion.
p334
aVHis voice carries a lot of weight within the community
p335
aVbecause he knows what he's doing.
p336
aVSo how is all this governed?
p337
aVPeople really want to know about administrators, things like that.
p338
aVSo the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community,
p339
aVis a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus \u2014
p340
aVmeaning we try not to vote on the content of articles,
p341
aVbecause the majority view is not necessarily neutral \u2014
p342
aVsome amount of democracy \u2014
p343
aVall of the administrators \u2014
p344
aVthese are the people who have the ability to delete pages.
p345
aVThat doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages.
p346
aVThey still have to follow all the rules \u2014 but they're elected by the community.
p347
aa(lp348
VSometimes people \u2014 random trolls on the Internet \u2014
p349
aVlike to accuse me of handpicking the administrators
p350
aVto bias the content of the encyclopedia.
p351
aVI always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.
p352
aVThere's a certain amount of aristocracy.
p353
aVYou got a hint of that when I mentioned, like,
p354
aVRickK's voice would carry a lot more weight
p355
aVthan someone we don't know.
p356
aa(lp357
VI give this talk sometimes with Angela,
p358
aVwho was just re-elected to the board from the community \u2014
p359
aVto the Board of the Foundation,
p360
aVwith more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it.
p361
aVAnd I always embarrass her because I say,
p362
aV"Well, Angela, for example,
p363
aVcould get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia,
p364
aVbecause she's so admired and so powerful."
p365
aVBut the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person
p366
aVwho you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia.
p367
aVAnd I also like to say she's the only person
p368
aVwho actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...
p369
aVAnd then there's monarchy,
p370
aVand that's my role on the community, so ...
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VI was describing this in Berlin once,
p375
aVand the next day in the newspaper the headline said,
p376
aV"I am the Queen of England."
p377
aa(lp378
V(Laughter)
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd that's not exactly what I said, but \u2014
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
Vthe point is my role in the community \u2014
p385
aVWithin the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition
p386
aVof the "benevolent dictator" model.
p387
aVSo if you look at most of the major free software projects,
p388
aVthey have one single person in charge
p389
aVwho everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator.
p390
aVWell, I don't like the term "benevolent dictator,"
p391
aVand I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas
p392
aVto be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge
p393
aVcompiled by the world.
p394
aVIt just isn't appropriate.
p395
aVBut there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy,
p396
aVa certain amount of \u2014
p397
aVsometimes we have to make a decision
p398
aVand we don't want to get bogged down too heavily
p399
aVin formal decision-making processes.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo as an example of how this can be important:
p402
aVwe recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,
p403
aVand they said, "Oh, well, this is horrible,
p404
aVthis Jewish conspiracy of a website,
p405
aVand we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like.
p406
aVAnd we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send \u2014
p407
aVwe have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over
p408
aVand they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted."
p409
aVWell, they managed to get 18 people to show up.
p410
aVThat's neo-Nazi math for you.
p411
aVThey always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.
p412
aVBut they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way

aVto delete a perfectly valid article.
p414
aVOf course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18,
p415
aVso there was no real danger to our democratic processes.
p416
aVOn the other hand, people said, "But what are we going to do?
p417
aVI mean, this could happen.
p418
aVWhat if some group gets really seriously organized
p419
aVand comes in and wants to vote?"
p420
aVThen I said, "Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules."
p421
aVThat's my job in the community:
p422
aVto say we won't allow our openness and freedom
p423
aVto undermine the quality of the content.
p424
aVAnd so, as long as people trust me in my role,
p425
aVthen that's a valid place for me.
p426
aVOf course, because of the free licensing,
p427
aVif I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave \u2014
p428
aVI can't tell anyone what to do.

VSo the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works,
p431
aVit's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work,
p432
aVbut we are not fanatical web anarchists.
p433
aVIn fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology,
p434
aVbecause ultimately, the passion of the community
p435
aVis for the quality of the work,
p436
aVnot necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.
p437

VBen Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.
p443
aVJimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success.
p444
aVIt strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children
p445
aVare inherently biased.
p446
aVHave you found Wikipedia being used by teachers
p447
aVand how do you see Wikipedia changing education?
p448
aa(lp449
VJimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.
p450
aVThere's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.
p451
aVIt builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
p452
aVAnd the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,
p453
aVbut academics hate it and teachers hate it.
p454
aVAnd that turns out to not be true.
p455
aVThe last time I got an email from a journalist saying,
p456
aV"Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"
p457
aVI sent it from my Harvard email address
p458
aVbecause I was recently appointed a fellow there.
p459
aVAnd I said, "Well, they don't all hate it."
p460
aa(lp461
V(Laughter)
p462
aa(lp463
VBut I think there's going to be huge impacts.
p464
aVAnd we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about,
p465
aVwhich is the Wikibooks project,
p466
aVwhich is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages.
p467
aVAnd that's a much bigger project.
p468
aVIt's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition.
p469
aa(lp470
VBut part of that is to fulfill our mission
p471
aVof giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
p472
aVWe don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.
p473
aVWe mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use.
p474
aVAnd for a lot of people in the world,
p475
aVif I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level,
p476
aVit doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials
p477
aVto build you up to the point where you can actually use it.
p478
aVThe Wikibooks project is an effort to do that.
p479
aVAnd I think that we're going to see \u2014 it may not even come from us;
p480
aVthere's all kinds of innovation going on.
p481
aVBut freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.
