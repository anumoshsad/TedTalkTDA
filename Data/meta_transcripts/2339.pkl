VOver our lifetimes,
p4
aVwe've all contributed to climate change.
p5
aVActions, choices and behaviors
p6
aVwill have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
p7
aVAnd I think that that's quite a powerful thought.
p8
aVBut it does have the potential to make us feel guilty
p9
aVwhen we think about decisions we might have made
p10
aVaround where to travel to,
p11
aVhow often and how,
p12
aVabout the energy that we choose to use
p13
aVin our homes or in our workplaces,
p14
aVor quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy.
p15
aVBut we can also turn that thought on its head,
p16
aVand think that if we've had such a profound
p17
aVbut a negative impact on our climate already,
p18
aVthen we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change
p19
aVthat we will need to adapt to.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo we have a choice.
p22
aVWe can either choose to start to take climate change seriously,
p23
aVand significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions,
p24
aVand then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future.
p25
aVAlternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem.
p26
aVBut if we do that, we are also choosing
p27
aVto adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future.
p28
aVAnd not only that.
p29
aVAs people who live in countries with high per capita emissions,
p30
aVwe're making that choice on behalf of others as well.
p31
aVBut the choice that we don't have
p32
aVis a no climate change future.
p33
aa(lp34
VOver the last two decades,
p35
aVour government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together
p36
aVto discuss climate change,
p37
aVand they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming
p38
aVabove pre-industrial levels.
p39
aVThat's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts
p40
aVacross a range of different indicators,
p41
aVto humans and to the environment.
p42
aVSo two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut dangerous climate change can be subjective.
p45
aVSo if we think about an extreme weather event
p46
aVthat might happen in some part of the world,
p47
aVand if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure,
p48
aVwhere there are people that are well-insured and so on,
p49
aVthen that impact can be disruptive.
p50
aVIt can cause upset, it could cause cost.
p51
aVIt could even cause some deaths.
p52
aVBut if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world
p53
aVwhere there is poor infrastructure,
p54
aVor where people are not well-insured,
p55
aVor they're not having good support networks,
p56
aVthen that same climate change impact could be devastating.
p57
aVIt could cause a significant loss of home,
p58
aVbut it could also cause significant amounts of death.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side
p61
aVfrom fossil fuel and industry,
p62
aVand time from before the Industrial Revolution
p63
aVout towards the present day.
p64
aVAnd what's immediately striking about this
p65
aVis that emissions have been growing exponentially.
p66
aVIf we focus in on a shorter period of time from 1950,
p67
aVwe have established in 1988
p68
aVthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
p69
aVthe Rio Earth Summit in 1992,
p70
aVthen rolling on a few years, in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,
p71
aVwhere it established avoiding a two-degree temperature rise
p72
aVin keeping with the science and on the basis of equity.
p73
aVAnd then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.
p74
aVAnd all the way through, during all of these meetings
p75
aVand many others as well,
p76
aVemissions have continued to rise.
p77
aVAnd if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years,
p78
aVand we put that together with our understanding
p79
aVof the direction of travel in our global economy,
p80
aVthen we are much more on track
p81
aVfor a four-degree centigrade global warming
p82
aVthan we are for the two-degree centigrade.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, let's just pause for a moment
p85
aVand think about this four-degree global average temperature.
p86
aVMost of our planet is actually made up of the sea.
p87
aVNow, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land,
p88
aVthe average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher
p89
aVthan they are over the sea.
p90
aVThe second thing is that we as human beings don't experience
p91
aVglobal average temperatures.
p92
aVWe experience hot days, cold days,
p93
aVrainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo now put yourself in a city center.
p96
aVImagine somewhere in the world:
p97
aVMumbai, Beijing, New York, London.
p98
aVIt's the hottest day that you've ever experienced.
p99
aVThere's sun beating down,
p100
aVthere's concrete and glass all around you.
p101
aVNow imagine that same day \u2014
p102
aVbut it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer
p103
aVon that day during that heat wave.
p104
aVThat's the kind of thing we're going to experience
p105
aVunder a four-degree global average temperature scenario.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd the problem with these extremes,
p108
aVand not just the temperature extremes,
p109
aVbut also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts,
p110
aVis our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events.
p111
aVSo our roads and our rail networks
p112
aVhave been designed to last for a long time
p113
aVand withstand only certain amounts of impacts
p114
aVin different parts of the world.
p115
aVAnd this is going to be extremely challenged.
p116
aVOur power stations are expected to be cooled by water
p117
aVto a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient.
p118
aVAnd our buildings are designed to be comfortable
p119
aVwithin a particular temperature range.
p120
aVAnd this is all going to be significantly challenged
p121
aVunder a four-degree-type scenario.
p122
aVOur infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo if we go back, also thinking about four degrees,
p125
aVit's not just the direct impacts,
p126
aVbut also some indirect impacts.
p127
aVSo if we take food security, for example.
p128
aVMaize and wheat yields
p129
aVin some parts of the world
p130
aVare expected to be up to 40 percent lower
p131
aVunder a four-degree scenario,
p132
aVrice up to 30 percent lower.
p133
aVThis will be absolutely devastating for global food security.
p134
aVSo all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated
p135
aVunder this four-degree centigrade scenario
p136
aVare going to be incompatible with global organized living.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees.
p139
aVIs it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path?
p140
aVThere are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists
p141
aVwho would say that it's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming.
p142
aVBut I would just like to draw on my own research
p143
aVon energy systems, on food systems,
p144
aVaviation and also shipping,
p145
aVjust to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance
p146
aVof avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change.
p147
aVBut we really need to get to grips with the numbers
p148
aVto work out how to do it.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs,
p151
aVthe yellow circle there highlights that the departure
p152
aVfrom the red four-degree pathway
p153
aVto the two-degree green pathway is immediate.
p154
aVAnd that's because of cumulative emissions,
p155
aVor the carbon budget.
p156
aVSo in other words, because of the lights and the projectors
p157
aVthat are on in this room right now,
p158
aVthe CO2 that is going into our atmosphere
p159
aVas a result of that electricity consumption
p160
aVlasts a very long time.
p161
aVSome of it will be in our atmosphere for a century, maybe much longer.
p162
aVIt will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative.
p163
aVAnd that tells us something about these trajectories.
p164
aVFirst of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter,
p165
aVnot where we reach at a particular date in future.
p166
aVAnd that's important, because it doesn't matter
p167
aVif we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology
p168
aVto sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049,
p169
aVjust in the nick of time to sort things out.
p170
aVBecause in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated.
p171
aVSo if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,
p172
aVthe longer we continue on it,
p173
aVthat will need to be made up for in later years
p174
aVto keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve,
p175
aVwhich means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper.
p176
aVSo in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term,
p177
aVthen we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions.
p178
aVWe also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system.
p179
aVBut if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term,
p180
aVthen we will have to do that even sooner.
p181
aVSo this poses really big challenges for us.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy.
p184
aVIf you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high,
p185
aVit points us towards reducing energy demand.
p186
aVAnd that's because with all the will in the world,
p187
aVthe large-scale engineering infrastructure
p188
aVthat we need to roll out rapidly
p189
aVto decarbonize the supply side of our energy system
p190
aVis just simply not going to happen in time.
p191
aVSo it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power
p192
aVor carbon capture and storage,
p193
aVupscale our biofuel production,
p194
aVor go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines.
p195
aVAll of that will take time.
p196
aVSo because it's the area under the curve that matters,
p197
aVwe need to focus on energy efficiency,
p198
aVbut also on energy conservation \u2014 in other words, using less energy.
p199
aVAnd if we do that, that also means
p200
aVthat as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology,
p201
aVwe will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed
p202
aVto reduce our energy consumption,
p203
aVbecause we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnother issue that we really need to grapple with
p206
aVis the issue of well-being and equity.
p207
aVThere are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise.
p208
aVBbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel,
p209
aVas those economies grow so will emissions.
p210
aVAnd now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget,
p211
aVthat means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise,
p212
aVthen other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations.
p215
aVBecause according to our research,
p216
aVif you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high \u2014
p217
aVso North America, Europe, Australia \u2014
p218
aVemissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year,
p219
aVand starting immediately, will be required for a good chance
p220
aVof avoiding the two-degree target.
p221
aVLet me just put that into context.
p222
aVThe economist Nicholas Stern
p223
aVsaid that emission reductions of more than one percent per year
p224
aVhad only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval.
p225
aVSo this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth,
p226
aVbecause if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place,
p227
aVit means that if our economies grow,
p228
aVthen so do our emissions.
p229
aVSo I'd just like to take a quote from a paper
p230
aVby myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011
p231
aVwhere we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change,
p232
aVeconomic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily
p233
aVfor a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations.
p234
aa(lp235
VThis is a really difficult message to take,
p236
aVbecause what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently.
p237
aVThis is not about just incremental change.
p238
aVThis is about doing things differently, about whole system change,
p239
aVand sometimes it's about doing less things.
p240
aVAnd this applies to all of us,
p241
aVwhatever sphere of influence we have.
p242
aVSo it could be from writing to our local politician
p243
aVto talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work,
p244
aVor talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.
p245
aVBecause we really need to make significant change.
p246
aVAt the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario.
p247
aVIf we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario,
p248
aVthere really is no time like the present to act.
p249
aa(lp250
VThank you.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VBruno Giussani: Alice, basically what you're saying,
p255
aVthe talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year
p256
aVthe emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25,
p257
aVwe are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario.
p258
aVI am wondering what's your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.
p259
aa(lp260
VAlice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.
p261
aVOne of the things that often \u2014
p262
aVwhen there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do,
p263
aVis they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world
p264
aVcan start to reduce emissions.
p265
aVSo they make kind of heroic assumptions about that.
p266
aVThe more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions,
p267
aVthe short-term stuff that really matters.
p268
aVSo it does make a huge difference.
p269
aVIf a big country like China, for example,
p270
aVcontinues to grow even for just a few extra years,
p271
aVthat will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize.
p272
aVSo I don't think we can even say when it will be,
p273
aVbecause it all depends on what we have to do in the short term.
p274
aVBut I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers
p275
aVthat allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame.
p276
