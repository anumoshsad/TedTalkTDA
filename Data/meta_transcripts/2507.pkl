VSo this is James Risen.
p4
aVYou may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter
p5
aVfor The New York Times.
p6
aVLong before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name,
p7
aVRisen wrote a book in which he famously exposed
p8
aVthat the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.
p9
aVBut it's another chapter in that book
p10
aVthat may have an even more lasting impact.
p11
aVIn it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation
p12
aVin which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints
p13
aVof a nuclear bomb to Iran.
p14
aVIf that sounds crazy, go read it.
p15
aVIt's an incredible story.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut you know who didn't like that chapter?
p18
aVThe US government.
p19
aVFor nearly a decade afterwards,
p20
aVRisen was the subject of a US government investigation
p21
aVin which prosecutors demanded that he testify
p22
aVagainst one of his alleged sources.
p23
aVAnd along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern
p24
aVof prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
p25
aa(lp26
VYou see, under the First Amendment,
p27
aVthe press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.
p28
aVBut it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news
p29
aVand protect the identities of the brave men and women
p30
aVwho get it to them.
p31
aVSo when the government came knocking,
p32
aVRisen did what many brave reporters have done before him:
p33
aVhe refused
p34
aVand said he'd rather go to jail.
p35
aVSo from 2007 to 2015,
p36
aVRisen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.
p37
aa(lp38
VThat is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.
p39
aVSuddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case,
p40
aVthe government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.
p41
aVIt turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance,
p42
aVthere are very few places reporters and sources can hide.
p43
aVAnd instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify,
p44
aVthey could have his digital trail testify against him instead.
p45
aVSo completely in secret and without his consent,
p46
aVprosecutors got Risen's phone records.
p47
aVThey got his email records, his financial and banking information,
p48
aVhis credit reports,
p49
aVeven travel records with a list of flights he had taken.
p50
aVAnd it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,
p51
aVRisen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.
p52
aa(lp53
VSadly, this is only one case of many.
p54
aVPresident Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers,
p55
aVand instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more
p56
aVthan all other administrations combined.
p57
aVNow, you can see how this could be a problem,
p58
aVespecially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.
p59
aVSince 9/11, virtually every important story about national security
p60
aVhas been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.
p61
aVSo we risk seeing the press unable to do their job
p62
aVthat the First Amendment is supposed to protect
p63
aVbecause of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut just as technology has allowed the government
p66
aVto circumvent reporters' rights,
p67
aVthe press can also use technology
p68
aVto protect their sources even better than before.
p69
aVAnd they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them,
p70
aVrather than on the witness stand after the fact.
p71
aVCommunications software now exists
p72
aVthat wasn't available when Risen was writing his book,
p73
aVand is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.
p74
aVFor example, one such tool is SecureDrop,
p75
aVan open-source whistleblower submission system
p76
aVthat was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,
p77
aVand is now developed at the non-profit where I work,
p78
aVFreedom of the Press Foundation.
p79
aVInstead of sending an email,
p80
aVyou go to a news organization's website,
p81
aVlike this one here on The Washington Post.
p82
aVFrom there, you can upload a document or send information
p83
aVmuch like you would on any other contact form.
p84
aVIt'll then be encrypted and stored on a server
p85
aVthat only the news organization has access to.
p86
aVSo the government can no longer secretly demand the information,
p87
aVand much of the information they would demand
p88
aVwouldn't be available in the first place.
p89
aa(lp90
VSecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle
p91
aVfor protecting press freedom in the 21st century.
p92
aVUnfortunately, governments all over the world
p93
aVare constantly developing new spying techniques
p94
aVthat put us all at risk.
p95
aVAnd it's up to us going forward to make sure
p96
aVthat it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers,
p97
aVlike Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.
p98
aVIt's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower
p99
aValerting us to overcrowded hospitals,
p100
aVor the next environmental worker
p101
aVsounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water,
p102
aVor a Wall Street insider
p103
aVwarning us of the next financial crisis.
p104
aVAfter all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women
p105
aVwho expose crimes,
p106
aVbut are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.
