VI'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.
p4
aVWhat I mean by that is that it's time for architecture
p5
aVto do things again, not just represent things.
p6
aVThis is a construction helmet that I received two years ago
p7
aVat the groundbreaking of the largest project
p8
aVI, and my firm, have ever been involved in.
p9
aVI was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person
p10
aVstanding on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.
p11
aVI thought it represented the importance of the architect.
p12
aa(lp13
VI stayed thrilled until I got home,
p14
aVthrew the helmet onto my bed,
p15
aVfell down onto my bed and realized inside
p16
aVthere was an inscription.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVNow, I think that this is a great metaphor
p19
aVfor the state of architecture and architects today.
p20
aVWe are for decorative purposes only.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, who do we have to blame?
p24
aVWe can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years
p25
aVthe design and construction industry has gotten much more complex
p26
aVand has gotten much more litigious.
p27
aVAnd we architects are cowards.
p28
aVSo, as we have faced liability,
p29
aVwe have stepped back and back,
p30
aVand unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:
p31
aVpower.
p32
aVSo, eventually we have found ourselves
p33
aVin a totally marginalized position, way over here.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, what did we do? We're cowards,
p36
aVbut we're smart cowards.
p37
aVAnd so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.
p38
aVAnd we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,
p39
aVin this autonomous language
p40
aVwe're going to seed control of processes."
p41
aVAnd we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.
p42
aVWe actually created an artificial schism
p43
aVbetween creation and execution,
p44
aVas if you could actually create without knowing how to execute
p45
aVand as if you could actually execute
p46
aVwithout knowing how to create.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, something else happened.
p49
aVAnd that's when we began to sell the world
p50
aVthat architecture was created by individuals
p51
aVcreating genius sketches.
p52
aVAnd that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches
p53
aVfor years and years and years is not only something
p54
aVto be derided,
p55
aVbut we would merely write it off as
p56
aVmerely execution.
p57
aVNow I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating
p58
aVthat 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,
p59
aVand nine months of gestation,
p60
aVand, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor
p61
aVis merely execution.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back
p64
aVcreation and execution.
p65
aVAnd we need to start authoring processes again
p66
aVinstead of authoring objects.
p67
aVNow, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years
p68
aVand start reinjecting agency,
p69
aVsocial engineering, back into architecture.
p70
aVNow, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,
p71
aVlike managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,
p72
aVunderstanding procurement processes,
p73
aVunderstanding the time value of money and cost estimation.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,
p76
aVinto three very pedantic statements.
p77
aVThe first is: Take core positions with your client.
p78
aVI know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe second position is: Actually take positions.
p81
aVTake joint positions with your client.
p82
aVThis is the moment in which you as the architect
p83
aVand your client can begin to inject
p84
aVvision and agency.
p85
aVBut it has to be done together.
p86
aVAnd then only after this is done
p87
aVare you allowed to do this, begin to put forward
p88
aVarchitectural manifestations
p89
aVthat manifest those positions.
p90
aVAnd both owner and architect alike
p91
aVare empowered to critique those manifestations
p92
aVbased on the positions that you've taken.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.
p95
aVI'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.
p96
aVYou do not know what the end result is.
p97
aVBut I promise you, with enough brain power
p98
aVand enough passion and enough commitment,
p99
aVyou will arrive at conclusions
p100
aVthat will transcend convention,
p101
aVand will simply be something
p102
aVthat you could not have initially
p103
aVor individually conceived of.
p104
aa(lp105
VAlright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series
p106
aVof simple dumb sketches.
p107
aVThis is the modus operandi that we have today.
p108
aVWe roll 120-foot Spartan,
p109
aVi.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.
p110
aVAnd we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?
p111
aVWell, how about instead of doing that,
p112
aVwe roll up to the gates something they want.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,
p115
aVbecause of course we all know that inside
p116
aVof the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.
p117
aVSo, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse
p118
aVthe vessel by which
p119
aVyou get through the gate,
p120
aVget through the constraints of a project.
p121
aVAt which point, you and your client
p122
aVhave the ability to start considering what
p123
aVyou're going to put inside that vessel,
p124
aVthe agency, the vision.
p125
aVAnd if you do that, you do that responsibly,
p126
aVI believe that instead of delivering Spartans,
p127
aVyou can deliver maidens.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.
p130
aVIf we are so good at our craft
p131
aVshouldn't we be able to conceive
p132
aVof an architectural manifestation
p133
aVthat slides seamlessly through
p134
aVthe project's and the client's constraints?
p135
aVNow, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project
p136
aVthat's very dear to many people in this room\u2014
p137
aVwell, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.
p138
aVAnd that's a project that is just about to open next week,
p139
aVthe new home for the Dallas Theater Center,
p140
aVthe Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, I'm going to present it on the same terms:
p143
aVissue, position and architectural manifestation.
p144
aVNow, the first issue that we faced
p145
aVwas that the Dallas Theater Center
p146
aVhad a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect
p147
aVof some place outside of the triumvirate
p148
aVof New York, Chicago and Seattle.
p149
aVAnd this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.
p150
aVBut it also had to do with something rather unusual,
p151
aVand that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.
p152
aa(lp153
VWhy was this horrible little building
p154
aVso important to their renown and their innovation?
p155
aVBecause they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.
p156
aVWhen you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.
p157
aVThis building, when an artistic director
p158
aVwanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people
p159
aVand wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,
p160
aVthey brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.
p161
aVWell, that's exciting.
p162
aVAnd you can start to get the best artistic directors,
p163
aVscenic designers and actors from around the country
p164
aVto come to perform here
p165
aVbecause you can do things you can't do elsewhere.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, the first position we took was,
p168
aV"Hey, we as architects had better not show up
p169
aVand do a pristine building
p170
aVthat doesn't engender the same freedoms that this
p171
aVold dilapidated shed provided the company."
p172
aVThe second issue is a nuance of the first.
p173
aVAnd that's that the company and the building was multiform.
p174
aVThat meant that they were able to perform,
p175
aVas long as they had labor
p176
aVthey were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,
p177
aVarena, traverse, you name it.
p178
aVAll they needed was labor.
p179
aa(lp180
VWell, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions
p181
aVaround the world.
p182
aVIt started to become hard to raise operational costs,
p183
aVoperational budgets.
p184
aVSo, they stopped having inexpensive labor.
p185
aVAnd eventually they had to freeze their organization
p186
aVinto something called a bastardized thruscenium.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,
p189
aVthe ability to move between stage configurations,
p190
aVhad better be able to be done
p191
aVwithout relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.
p192
aVThe architectural manifestation
p193
aVwas frankly just dumb.
p194
aVIt was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house
p195
aVand redefine them as above house and below house.
p196
aa(lp197
VAt first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,
p198
aVwhat could you possibly gain?"
p199
aVWe created what we like to call superfly.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aVNow, superfly, the concept is
p202
aVyou take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,
p203
aVand you smear them across flytower and auditorium.
p204
aVSuddenly the artistic director
p205
aVcan move between different stage
p206
aVand audience configurations.
p207
aVAnd because that flytower has the ability to pick up
p208
aVall the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment
p209
aVcan be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw
p210
aVpaint and replace,
p211
aVwith a minimum of cost.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move
p214
aVthat was unexpected.
p215
aVAnd that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium
p216
aVin a most unusual way.
p217
aVAnd that provided the artistic director suddenly
p218
aVthe ability to define suspension of disbelief.
p219
aVSo, the building affords artistic directors the freedom
p220
aVto conceive of almost any kind of activity
p221
aVunderneath this floating object.
p222
aVBut also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief
p223
aVsuch that in the last act of Macbeth,
p224
aVif he or she wants you to associate
p225
aVthe parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,
p226
aVhe or she can do so.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, in order to do this we and the clients
p229
aVhad to do something fairly remarkable.
p230
aVIn fact it really was the clients who had to do it.
p231
aVThey had to make a decision, based on the positions we took
p232
aVto redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture
p233
aVand one-third infrastructure,
p234
aVto actually the inverse,
p235
aVtwo-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.
p236
aVThat's a lot for a client to commit to
p237
aVbefore you actually see the fruition of the concept.
p238
aVBut based on the positions,
p239
aVthey took the educated leap of faith to do so.
p240
aVAnd effectively we created what we like to call
p241
aVa theater machine.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, that theater machine has ability
p244
aVto move between a whole series of configurations
p245
aVat the push of a button and a few stagehands
p246
aVin a short amount of time.
p247
aVBut it also has the potential
p248
aVto not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.
p249
aVMeaning: The artistic director
p250
aVdoesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.
p251
aa(lp252
VOne of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters
p253
aVis they hate us architects,
p254
aVbecause they say the first thing they have to do,
p255
aVthe first five minutes of any show,
p256
aVis they have to get our architecture
p257
aVout of the mind of their patron.
p258
aVWell now there are potentials of this building
p259
aVto allow the artistic director
p260
aVto actually move into the building
p261
aVwithout using our architecture.
p262
aVSo, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.
p263
aVYou're going down into our lobby,
p264
aVgo through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,
p265
aVup through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.
p266
aa(lp267
VBut there is also the potential
p268
aVto allow people to move directly from the outside,
p269
aVin this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,
p270
aVinto the interior of the auditorium.
p271
aVAnd here is the fruition of that in actuality.
p272
aVThese are the two large pivoting doors
p273
aVthat allow people to move directly from the outside, in
p274
aVor from the inside, out,
p275
aVperformers or audience alike.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly
p278
aVthis is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.
p279
aVBut imagine the freedoms
p280
aVif you could take this further, that in fact you could consider
p281
aVa Wagnerian entry,
p282
aVa first act in thrust,
p283
aVan intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,
p284
aVand you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.
p285
aVNow that, I would say, is architecture performing.
p286
aVIt is taking the hand of the architect
p287
aVto actually remove the hand of the architect
p288
aVin favor of the hand of the artistic director.
p289
aa(lp290
VI'll go through the three basic configurations.
p291
aVThis is the flat floor configuration.
p292
aVYou notice that there is no proscenium,
p293
aVthe balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,
p294
aVthe floor in the auditorium is flat.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe first configuration is easy to understand.
p297
aVThe balconies come down, you see that the orchestra
p298
aVbegins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,
p299
aVand the seats come in.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe third configuration is a little harder to understand.
p302
aVHere you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way
p303
aVin order to bring a thrust into the space.
p304
aVAnd some of the seats need to actually change their direction,
p305
aVand change their rake, to allow that to happen.
p306
aa(lp307
VI'll do it again so you can see it.
p308
aVThere you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.
p309
aVAnd there it is in the thrust configuration.
p310
aa(lp311
VIn order to do that,
p312
aVagain, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.
p313
aVAnd they told us one important thing:
p314
aV"You shall not beta-test."
p315
aVMeaning, nothing that we do
p316
aVcan we be the first ones to do it.
p317
aVBut they were willing for us to apply technologies
p318
aVfrom other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd the solution in terms of the balconies
p321
aVwas to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.
p322
aVNow, if you were to take a scoreboard
p323
aVand drop it on dirt and whiskey,
p324
aVthat would be bad.
p325
aVIf you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena
p326
aVand be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,
p327
aVthat would also be bad.
p328
aVAnd so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms
p329
aVand allowed the theater and our client
p330
aVto actually do this with confidence
p331
aVthat they would be able to change over their configurations at will.
p332
aa(lp333
VThe second technology that we applied
p334
aVwas actually using things that you know from
p335
aVthe stage side of an opera house.
p336
aVIn this case what we're doing is we're taking
p337
aVthe orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,
p338
aVchanging the rake, taking it back to flat floor,
p339
aVchanging the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define
p340
aVrakes and viewing angles
p341
aVof people in the orchestra seating, at will.
p342
aa(lp343
VHere you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage
p344
aVto thrust configuration.
p345
aVThe proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world
p346
aVin which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.
p347
aVHere you see the various acoustic baffles as well as
p348
aVthe flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.
p349
aVAnd ultimately, up in the flytower,
p350
aVthe scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.
p351
aa(lp352
VAs I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible
p353
aVyet affordable configuration.
p354
aVBut we got this other benefit, and that was
p355
aVthe ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage
p356
aVDallas on the outside.
p357
aVHere you see the building in its current state
p358
aVwith blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.
p359
aVActually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds
p360
aVthat are integrated into the windows themselves,
p361
aVagain with failsafe mechanisms
p362
aVthat can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,
p363
aVif you chose, the operations of the theater
p364
aVgoing on behind, rehearsals and so forth.
p365
aVBut you also have the ability
p366
aVto allow the audience to see Dallas,
p367
aVto perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.
p368
aa(lp369
VNow, if I'll take you through \u2014
p370
aVthis is an early concept sketch \u2014
p371
aVtake you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.
p372
aVEffectively you would have something like this.
p373
aVYou would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:
p374
aV"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.
p375
aVYou would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas
p376
aVor vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.
p377
aVYou'd be able to open portions in order to
p378
aVchange the procession,
p379
aVallow people to come in and out for an intermission,
p380
aVor to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.
p381
aa(lp382
VAs I said, all the balconies can move,
p383
aVbut they can also be disappeared completely.
p384
aVThe proscenium can fly.
p385
aVYou can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
p386
aVBut most convincingly when we had to confront the idea
p387
aVof changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,
p388
aVis something that is represented by this.
p389
aVAnd again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,
p390
aVbut at least suggests the ideas.
p391
aa(lp392
VThis building has the ability, in short order,
p393
aVto go back to a flat floor organization
p394
aVsuch that they can rent it out.
p395
aVNow, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,
p396
aVplease consider doing your Christmas party here.
p397
aV(Laughter)
p398
aVThat allows the company to raise operational budgets
p399
aVwithout having to compete with other venues
p400
aVwith much larger auditoriums.
p401
aVThat's an enormous benefit.
p402
aa(lp403
VSo, the theater company has the ability
p404
aVto do totally hermetic,
p405
aVlight-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,
p406
aVgreat intimacy Shakespeare,
p407
aVbut can also do Beckett
p408
aVwith the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.
p409
aVHere it is in a flat floor configuration.
p410
aVThe theater has been going through its kind of paces.
p411
aa(lp412
VHere it is in an end stage configuration.
p413
aVIt's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.
p414
aVWe stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,
p415
aVand you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.
p416
aVIt was very unusual.
p417
aVHere it is in a thrust configuration.
p418
aVAnd last but not least,
p419
aVyou see this already has the ability to create events
p420
aVin order to generate operational budgets
p421
aVto overcome the building in fact performing
p422
aVto allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.
p423
aa(lp424
VI'm going to show you a brief time lapse.
p425
aVAs I said, this can be done with only two people,
p426
aVand with a minimum amount of time.
p427
aVThis is the first time that actually the changeover was done
p428
aVand so there is literally thousands of people because
p429
aVeveryone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.
p430
aVSo, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.
p431
aVAnd think of it being done with just a few people.
p432
aVAgain, just a couple people are required.
p433
aV(Laughter)
p434
aVI promise.
p435
aVEt voila.
p436
aV(Applause)
p437
aa(lp438
VSo, just in conclusion, a few shots.
p439
aVThis is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's
p440
aVDee and Charles Wyly Theater.
p441
aVThere it is at night.
p442
aVAnd last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center.
p443
aVYou can see the Winspear Opera House on the right
p444
aVand the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.
p445
aa(lp446
VAnd to remind you that here is an example in which
p447
aVarchitecture actually did something.
p448
aVBut we got to that conclusion
p449
aVwithout understanding where we were going,
p450
aVwhat we knew were a series of issues that the company
p451
aVand the client was confronted with.
p452
aVAnd we took positions with them, and it was through those positions
p453
aVthat we began to take architectural manifestations
p454
aVand we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,
p455
aVreally none of us could ever
p456
aVhave conceived of initially or individually.
p457
aVThank you.
