VDiana Reiss: You may think you're looking
p4
aVthrough a window at a dolphin spinning playfully,
p5
aVbut what you're actually looking through
p6
aVis a two-way mirror at a dolphin
p7
aVlooking at itself spinning playfully.
p8
aVThis is a dolphin that is self-aware.
p9
aVThis dolphin has self-awareness.
p10
aVIt's a young dolphin named Bayley.
p11
aVI've been very interested in understanding the nature
p12
aVof the intelligence of dolphins for the past 30 years.
p13
aVHow do we explore intelligence in this animal
p14
aVthat's so different from us?
p15
aVAnd what I've used is a very simple research tool,
p16
aVa mirror, and we've gained great information,
p17
aVreflections of these animal minds.
p18
aVDolphins aren't the only animals, the only non-human animals,
p19
aVto show mirror self-recognition.
p20
aVWe used to think this was a uniquely human ability,
p21
aVbut we learned that the great apes, our closest relatives,
p22
aValso show this ability.
p23
aVThen we showed it in dolphins,
p24
aVand then later in elephants.
p25
aVWe did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants,
p26
aVand it's been recently shown in the magpie.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, it's interesting, because we've embraced
p29
aVthis Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution,
p30
aVthis physical continuity.
p31
aVBut we've been much more reticent, much slower
p32
aVat recognizing this continuity in cognition,
p33
aVin emotion, in consciousness in other animals.
p34
aa(lp35
VOther animals are conscious.
p36
aVThey're emotional. They're aware.
p37
aVThere have been multitudes of studies with many species
p38
aVover the years that have given us exquisite evidence
p39
aVfor thinking and consciousness in other animals,
p40
aVother animals that are quite different than we are in form.
p41
aVWe are not alone.
p42
aVWe are not alone in these abilities.
p43
aVAnd I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,
p44
aVis that, with our growing awareness
p45
aVabout the consciousness of others
p46
aVand our relationship with the rest of the animal world,
p47
aVthat we'll give them the respect and protection
p48
aVthat they deserve.
p49
aVSo that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody,
p50
aVand I hope I can really engage you in this idea.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, I want to return to dolphins,
p53
aVbecause these are the animals that I feel like
p54
aVI've been working up closely and personal with
p55
aVfor over 30 years.
p56
aVAnd these are real personalities.
p57
aVThey are not persons, but they're personalities
p58
aVin every sense of the word.
p59
aVAnd you can't get more alien than the dolphin.
p60
aVThey are very different from us in body form.
p61
aVThey're radically different. They come from a radically different environment.
p62
aVIn fact, we're separated by 95 million years
p63
aVof divergent evolution.
p64
aVLook at this body.
p65
aVAnd in every sense of making a pun here,
p66
aVthese are true non-terrestrials.
p67
aa(lp68
VI wondered how we might interface with these animals.
p69
aVIn the 1980s, I developed an underwater keyboard.
p70
aVThis was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard.
p71
aVWhat I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control.
p72
aVThese are big brains, highly social animals,
p73
aVand I thought, well, if we give them choice and control,
p74
aVif they can hit a symbol on this keyboard \u2014
p75
aVand by the way, it was interfaced by fiber optic cables
p76
aVfrom Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer.
p77
aVThis seems prehistoric now,
p78
aVbut this was where we were with technology.
p79
aVSo the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,
p80
aVthey heard a computer-generated whistle,
p81
aVand they got an object or activity.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow here's a little video.
p84
aVThis is Delphi and Pan, and you're going to see Delphi
p85
aVhitting a key, he hears a computer-generated whistle \u2014 (Whistle) \u2014
p86
aVand gets a ball, so they can actually ask for things they want.
p87
aVWhat was remarkable is, they explored this keyboard
p88
aVon their own. There was no intervention on our part.
p89
aVThey explored the keyboard. They played around with it.
p90
aVThey figured out how it worked.
p91
aVAnd they started to quickly imitate the sounds
p92
aVthey were hearing on the keyboard.
p93
aVThey imitated on their own.
p94
aa(lp95
VBeyond that, though, they started learning
p96
aVassociations between the symbols, the sounds
p97
aVand the objects.
p98
aVWhat we saw was self-organized learning,
p99
aVand now I'm imagining, what can we do
p100
aVwith new technologies?
p101
aVHow can we create interfaces, new windows into
p102
aVthe minds of animals, with the technologies that exist today?
p103
aVSo I was thinking about this, and then, one day,
p104
aVI got a call from Peter.
p105
aa(lp106
VPeter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.
p107
aVOn a good day, it's music,
p108
aVand I want to talk a little bit about
p109
aVthe most amazing music-making experience I ever had.
p110
aVI'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals,
p111
aVand I would look in these eyes and wonder
p112
aVwhat was going on there?
p113
aVSo as an adult, when I started to read about
p114
aVthe amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko,
p115
aVwith Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Kanzi, Panbanisha,
p116
aVIrene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,
p117
aVI got all excited.
p118
aVWhat was amazing to me also
p119
aVwas they seemed a lot more adept
p120
aVat getting a handle on our language
p121
aVthan we were on getting a handle on theirs.
p122
aVI work with a lot of musicians from around the world,
p123
aVand often we don't have any common language at all,
p124
aVbut we sit down behind our instruments,
p125
aVand suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo I started cold-calling, and eventually got through
p128
aVto Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,
p129
aVand she invited me down.
p130
aVI went down, and the bonobos
p131
aVhad had access to percussion instruments,
p132
aVmusical toys, but never before to a keyboard.
p133
aVAt first they did what infants do,
p134
aVjust bashed it with their fists,
p135
aVand then I asked, through Sue,
p136
aVif Panbanisha could try with one finger only.
p137
aa(lp138
VSue Savage-Rumbaugh: Can you play a grooming song?
p139
aVI want to hear a grooming song.
p140
aVPlay a real quiet grooming song.
p141
aa(lp142
VPG: So groom was the subject of the piece.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Music)
p145
aa(lp146
VSo I'm just behind, jamming,
p147
aVyeah, this is what we started with.
p148
aVSue's encouraging her to continue a little more.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Music)
p151
aa(lp152
VShe discovers a note she likes,
p153
aVfinds the octave.
p154
aVShe'd never sat at a keyboard before.
p155
aVNice triplets.
p156
aa(lp157
VSSR: You did good. That was very good.
p158
aa(lp159
VPG: She hit good.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Applause)
p162
aa(lp163
VSo that night, we began to dream,
p164
aVand we thought, perhaps the most amazing tool
p165
aVthat man's created is the Internet,
p166
aVand what would happen if we could somehow
p167
aVfind new interfaces,
p168
aVvisual-audio interfaces that would allow
p169
aVthese remarkable sentient beings
p170
aVthat we share the planet with access?
p171
aVAnd Sue Savage-Rumbaugh got excited about that,
p172
aVcalled her friend Steve Woodruff,
p173
aVand we began hustling all sorts of people
p174
aVwhose work related or was inspiring,
p175
aVwhich led us to Diana,
p176
aVand led us to Neil.
p177
aa(lp178
VNeil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter. PG: Thank you.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VNG: So Peter approached me.
p183
aVI lost it when I saw that clip.
p184
aVHe approached me with a vision of doing these things
p185
aVnot for people, for animals.
p186
aVAnd then I was struck in the history of the Internet.
p187
aVThis is what the Internet looked like when it was born
p188
aVand you can call that the Internet
p189
aVof middle-aged white men,
p190
aVmostly middle-aged white men.
p191
aa(lp192
VVint Cerf: (Laughs)
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VNG: Speaking as one.
p197
aa(lp198
VThen, when I first came to TED,
p199
aVwhich was where I met Peter, I showed this.
p200
aVThis is a $1 web server,
p201
aVand at the time that was radical.
p202
aVAnd the possibility of making a web server for a dollar
p203
aVgrew into what became known as the Internet of Things,
p204
aVwhich is literally an industry now with tremendous implications
p205
aVfor health care, energy efficiency.
p206
aVAnd we were happy with ourselves.
p207
aVAnd then when Peter showed me that,
p208
aVI realized we had missed something,
p209
aVwhich is the rest of the planet.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo we started up this interspecies Internet project.
p212
aVNow we started talking with TED
p213
aVabout how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants
p214
aVto TED, and we realized that wouldn't work.
p215
aVSo we're going to bring you to them.
p216
aVSo if we could switch to the audio from this computer,
p217
aVwe've been video conferencing with cognitive animals,
p218
aVand we're going to have each of them
p219
aVjust briefly introduce them.
p220
aVAnd so if we could also have this up, great.
p221
aVSo the first site we're going to meet
p222
aVis Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, with orangutans.
p223
aVIn the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now.
p224
aVSo can you please go ahead?
p225
aa(lp226
VTerri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox
p227
aVwith the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,
p228
aVand with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,
p229
aVtwo of our Bornean orangutans.
p230
aVDuring the day, they have a beautiful, large outdoor habitat,
p231
aVand at night, they come into this habitat,
p232
aVinto their night quarters,
p233
aVwhere they can have a climate-controlled
p234
aVand secure environment to sleep in.
p235
aVWe participate in the Apps for Apes program
p236
aVOrangutan Outreach, and we use iPads
p237
aVto help stimulate and enrich the animals,
p238
aVand also help raise awareness
p239
aVfor these critically endangered animals.
p240
aVAnd they share 97 percent of our DNA
p241
aVand are incredibly intelligent,
p242
aVso it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities
p243
aVthat we have via technology and the Internet
p244
aVto really enrich their lives and open up their world.
p245
aVWe're really excited about the possibility
p246
aVof an interspecies Internet,
p247
aVand K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much.
p248
aa(lp249
VNG: That's great. When we were rehearsing last night,
p250
aVhe had fun watching the elephants.
p251
aVNext user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium.
p252
aVPlease go ahead.
p253
aa(lp254
VAllison Ginsburg: Good evening.
p255
aVWell, my name is Allison Ginsburg,
p256
aVand we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium.
p257
aVJoining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins:
p258
aV20-year-old Chesapeake, who was our first dolphin born here,
p259
aVher four-year-old daughter Bayley,
p260
aVand her half sister, 11-year-old Maya.
p261
aVNow, here at the National Aquarium
p262
aVwe are committed to excellence in animal care,
p263
aVto research, and to conservation.
p264
aVThe dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight.
p265
aVThey're not really used to having cameras here
p266
aVat 8 o'clock at night.
p267
aVIn addition, we are very committed to doing
p268
aVdifferent types of research.
p269
aVAs Diana mentioned, our animals are involved
p270
aVin many different research studies.
p271
aa(lp272
VNG: Those are for you.
p273
aVOkay, that's great, thank you.
p274
aVAnd the third user group, in Thailand,
p275
aVis Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh.
p276
aa(lp277
VJosh Plotnik: Hi, my name is Josh Plotnik,
p278
aVand I'm with Think Elephants International,
p279
aVand we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand
p280
aVwith the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants.
p281
aVAnd we have 26 elephants here,
p282
aVand our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants,
p283
aVbut our foundation Think Elephants is focused
p284
aVon bringing elephants into classrooms around the world
p285
aVvirtually like this and showing people
p286
aVhow incredible these animals are.
p287
aVSo we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant,
p288
aVput food into the elephant's mouth,
p289
aVshow people what's going on inside their mouths,
p290
aVand show everyone around the world
p291
aVhow incredible these animals really are.
p292
aa(lp293
VNG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh.
p294
aVAnd once again, we've been building great relationships
p295
aVamong them just since we've been rehearsing.
p296
aVSo at that point, if we can go back to the other computer,
p297
aVwe were starting to think about how you integrate
p298
aVthe rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet,
p299
aVand we went to the best possible person
p300
aVI can think of, which is Vint Cerf,
p301
aVwho is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint?
p302
aa(lp303
VVC: Thank you, Neil.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VA long time ago in a galaxy \u2014 oops, wrong script.
p308
aVForty years ago, Bob Kahn and I
p309
aVdid the design of the Internet.
p310
aVThirty years ago, we turned it on.
p311
aVJust last year, we turned on the production Internet.
p312
aVYou've been using the experimental version
p313
aVfor the last 30 years.
p314
aVThe production version, it uses IP version 6.
p315
aVIt has 3.4 times 10 to the 38th possible terminations.
p316
aVThat's a number only that Congress can appreciate.
p317
aVBut it leads to what is coming next.
p318
aa(lp319
VWhen Bob and I did this design,
p320
aVwe thought we were building a system to connect computers together.
p321
aVWhat we very quickly discovered
p322
aVis that this was a system for connecting people together.
p323
aVAnd what you've seen tonight
p324
aVtells you that we should not restrict this network
p325
aVto one species,
p326
aVthat these other intelligent, sentient species
p327
aVshould be part of the system too.
p328
aa(lp329
VThis is the system as it looks today, by the way.
p330
aVThis is what the Internet looks like to a computer
p331
aVthat's trying to figure out where the traffic
p332
aVis supposed to go.
p333
aVThis is generated by a program
p334
aVthat's looking at the connectivity of the Internet,
p335
aVand how all the various networks are connected together.
p336
aVThere are about 400,000 networks, interconnected,
p337
aVrun independently by 400,000 different operating agencies,
p338
aVand the only reason this works
p339
aVis that they all use the same standard TCP/IP protocols.
p340
aa(lp341
VWell, you know where this is headed.
p342
aVThe Internet of Things tell us
p343
aVthat a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices
p344
aVare going to become part of this system too:
p345
aVappliances that you use around the house,
p346
aVthat you use in your office,
p347
aVthat you carry around with yourself or in the car.
p348
aVThat's the Internet of Things that's coming.
p349
aVNow, what's important about what these people are doing
p350
aVis that they're beginning to learn
p351
aVhow to communicate with species
p352
aVthat are not us
p353
aVbut share a common sensory environment.
p354
aVWe're beginning to explore what it means
p355
aVto communicate with something
p356
aVthat isn't just another person.
p357
aVWell, you can see what's coming next.
p358
aVAll kinds of possible sentient beings
p359
aVmay be interconnected through this system,
p360
aVand I can't wait to see these experiments unfold.
p361
aa(lp362
VWhat happens after that?
p363
aVWell, let's see.
p364
aVThere are machines that need to talk to machines
p365
aVand that we need to talk to, and so as time goes on,
p366
aVwe're going to have to learn
p367
aVhow to communicate with computers
p368
aVand how to get computers to communicate with us
p369
aVin the way that we're accustomed to,
p370
aVnot with keyboards, not with mice,
p371
aVbut with speech and gestures
p372
aVand all the natural human language that we're accustomed to.
p373
aVSo we'll need something like C3PO
p374
aVto become a translator between ourselves
p375
aVand some of the other machines we live with.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, there is a project that's underway
p378
aVcalled the interplanetary Internet.
p379
aVIt's in operation between Earth and Mars.
p380
aVIt's operating on the International Space Station.
p381
aVIt's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun
p382
aVthat's rendezvoused with two planets.
p383
aVSo the interplanetary system is on its way,
p384
aVbut there's a last project,
p385
aVwhich the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,
p386
aVwhich funded the original ARPANET,
p387
aVfunded the Internet, funded the interplanetary architecture,
p388
aVis now funding a project to design a spacecraft
p389
aVto get to the nearest star in 100 years' time.
p390
aVWhat that means is that what we're learning
p391
aVwith these interactions with other species
p392
aVwill teach us, ultimately,
p393
aVhow we might interact with an alien from another world.
p394
aVI can hardly wait.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aa(lp398
VJune Cohen: So first of all, thank you,
p399
aVand I would like to acknowledge that four people
p400
aVwho could talk to us for full four days
p401
aVactually managed to stay to four minutes each,
p402
aVand we thank you for that.
p403
aVI have so many questions,
p404
aVbut maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know.
p405
aVYou're launching this idea here at TED \u2014 PG: Today.
p406
aa(lp407
VJC: Today. This is the first time you're talking about it.
p408
aVTell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea.
p409
aVWhat's next?
p410
aa(lp411
VPG: I think we want to engage as many people
p412
aVhere as possible in helping us
p413
aVthink of smart interfaces that will make all this possible.
p414
aa(lp415
VNG: And just mechanically,
p416
aVthere's a 501(c)(3) and web infrastructure
p417
aVand all of that, but it's not quite ready to turn on,
p418
aVso we'll roll that out, and contact us
p419
aVif you want the information on it.
p420
aVThe idea is this will be \u2014 much like the Internet functions
p421
aVas a network of networks,
p422
aVwhich is Vint's core contribution,
p423
aVthis will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives,
p424
aVthat are wonderful individually, to link them globally.
p425
aa(lp426
VJC: Right, and do you have a web address
p427
aVthat we might look for yet?
p428
aa(lp429
VNG: Shortly. JC: Shortly. We will come back to you on that.
p430
aVAnd very quickly, just to clarify.
p431
aVSome people might have looked at the video that you showed
p432
aVand thought, well, that's just a webcam.
p433
aVWhat's special about it?
p434
aVIf you could talk for just a moment
p435
aVabout how you want to go past that?
p436
aa(lp437
VNG: So this is scalable video infrastructure,
p438
aVnot for a few to a few but many to many,
p439
aVso that it scales to symmetrical video sharing
p440
aVand content sharing across these sites around the planet.
p441
aVSo there's a lot of back-end signal processing,
p442
aVnot for one to many, but for many to many.
p443
aa(lp444
VJC: Right, and then on a practical level,
p445
aVwhich technologies are you looking at first?
p446
aVI know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this.
p447
aa(lp448
VDR: We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins.
p449
aVThis is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work,
p450
aVand we just got our first seed money today towards that,
p451
aVso it's our first project.
p452
aa(lp453
VJC: Before the talk, even. DR: Yeah.
p454
aa(lp455
VJC: Wow. Well done.
p456
aVAll right, well thank you all so much for joining us.
p457
aVIt's such a delight to have you on the stage.
p458
aa(lp459
