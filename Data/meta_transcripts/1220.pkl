VMy topic
p4
aVis economic growth in China and India.
p5
aVAnd the question I want to explore with you
p6
aVis whether or not
p7
aVdemocracy has helped or has hindered
p8
aVeconomic growth.
p9
aVYou may say this is not fair,
p10
aVbecause I'm selecting two countries
p11
aVto make a case against democracy.
p12
aVActually, exactly the opposite
p13
aVis what I'm going to do.
p14
aVI'm going to use these two countries
p15
aVto make an economic argument for democracy,
p16
aVrather than against democracy.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe first question there
p19
aVis why China has grown so much faster
p20
aVthan India.
p21
aVOver the last 30 years,
p22
aVin terms of the GDP growth rates,
p23
aVChina has grown at twice the rate of India.
p24
aVIn the last five years,
p25
aVthe two countries have begun to converge somewhat
p26
aVin economic growth.
p27
aVBut over the last 30 years,
p28
aVChina undoubtedly
p29
aVhas done much better than India.
p30
aVOne simple answer
p31
aVis China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.
p32
aVLook at the skyline of Shanghai.
p33
aVThis is the Pudong area.
p34
aVThe picture on India
p35
aVis the Dharavi slum of Mumbai
p36
aVin India.
p37
aVThe idea there
p38
aVbehind these two pictures
p39
aVis that the Chinese government
p40
aVcan act above rule of law.
p41
aVIt can plan
p42
aVfor the long-term benefits of the country
p43
aVand in the process,
p44
aVevict millions of people \u2014
p45
aVthat's just a small technical issue.
p46
aVWhereas in India, you cannot do that,
p47
aVbecause you have to listen to the public.
p48
aVYou're being constrained by the public's opinion.
p49
aVEven Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
p50
aVagrees with that view.
p51
aVIn an interview
p52
aVprinted in the financial press of India,
p53
aVHe said that he wants to make Mumbai
p54
aVanother Shanghai.
p55
aVThis is an Oxford-trained economist
p56
aVsteeped in humanistic values,
p57
aVand yet he agrees
p58
aVwith the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,
p61
aVthat emphasizes the following features
p62
aVfor promoting economic development:
p63
aVinfrastructures, airports,
p64
aVhighways, bridges, things like that.
p65
aVAnd you need a strong government to do that,
p66
aVbecause you cannot respect private property rights.
p67
aVYou cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.
p68
aVYou need also state ownership,
p69
aVespecially of land assets,
p70
aVin order to build and roll out infrastructures
p71
aVvery quickly.
p72
aVThe implication of that model
p73
aVis that democracy
p74
aVis a hindrance for economic growth,
p75
aVrather than a facilitator of economic growth.
p76
aVHere's the key question.
p77
aVJust how important are infrastructures
p78
aVfor economic growth?
p79
aVThis is a key issue.
p80
aVIf you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,
p81
aVthen you would argue a strong government is necessary
p82
aVto promote growth.
p83
aVIf you believe
p84
aVthat infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,
p85
aVthen you will put less emphasis
p86
aVon strong government.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo to illustrate that question,
p89
aVlet me give you two countries.
p90
aVAnd for the sake of brevity,
p91
aVI'll call one country Country 1
p92
aVand the other country Country 2.
p93
aVCountry 1
p94
aVhas a systematic advantage over Country 2
p95
aVin infrastructures.
p96
aVCountry 1 has more telephones,
p97
aVand Country 1 has a longer system of railways.
p98
aVSo if I were to ask you,
p99
aV"Which is China
p100
aVand which is India,
p101
aVand which country has grown faster?"
p102
aVif you believe in the infrastructure view,
p103
aVthen you will say, "Country 1 must be China.
p104
aVThey must have done better, in terms of economic growth.
p105
aVAnd Country 2 is possibly India."
p106
aa(lp107
VActually the country with more telephones
p108
aVis the Soviet Union,
p109
aVand the data referred to 1989.
p110
aVAfter the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,
p111
aVthe country collapsed.
p112
aVThat's not too good.
p113
aVThe picture there is Khrushchev.
p114
aVI know that in 1989
p115
aVhe no longer ruled the Soviet Union,
p116
aVbut that's the best picture that I can find.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVTelephones, infrastructures
p119
aVdo not guarantee you economic growth.
p120
aVCountry 2, that has fewer telephones,
p121
aVis China.
p122
aVSince 1989,
p123
aVthe country has performed at a double-digit rate
p124
aVevery year for the last 20 years.
p125
aVIf you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union
p126
aVother than the fact about their telephones,
p127
aVyou would have made a poor prediction
p128
aVabout their economic growth
p129
aVin the next two decades.
p130
aa(lp131
VCountry 1, that has a longer system of railways,
p132
aVis actually India.
p133
aVAnd Country 2 is China.
p134
aVThis is a very little known fact
p135
aVabout the two countries.
p136
aVYes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage
p137
aVover India.
p138
aVBut for many years,
p139
aVuntil the late 1990s,
p140
aVChina had an infrastructure disadvantage
p141
aVvis-a-vis India.
p142
aVIn developing countries,
p143
aVthe most common mode of transportation
p144
aVis the railways,
p145
aVand the British built a lot of railways in India.
p146
aVIndia is the smaller of the two countries,
p147
aVand yet it had a longer system of railways
p148
aVuntil the late 1990s.
p149
aVSo clearly,
p150
aVinfrastructure doesn't explain
p151
aVwhy China did better before the late 1990s,
p152
aVas compared with India.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,
p155
aVthe evidence is more supportive of the view
p156
aVthat the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.
p157
aVThe economy grows,
p158
aVgovernment accumulates more resources,
p159
aVand the government can invest in infrastructure \u2014
p160
aVrather than infrastructure being a cause
p161
aVfor economic growth.
p162
aVAnd this is clearly the story
p163
aVof the Chinese economic growth.
p164
aVLet me look at this question more directly.
p165
aVIs democracy bad for economic growth?
p166
aVNow let's turn to two countries,
p167
aVCountry A and Country B.
p168
aVCountry A, in 1990,
p169
aVhad about $300 per capita GDP
p170
aVas compared with Country B,
p171
aVwhich had $460 in per capita GDP.
p172
aVBy 2008,
p173
aVCountry A has surpassed Country B
p174
aVwith $700 per capita GDP
p175
aVas compared with $650 per capita GDP.
p176
aVBoth countries are in Asia.
p177
aa(lp178
VIf I were to ask you,
p179
aV"Which are the two Asian countries?
p180
aVAnd which one is a democracy?"
p181
aVyou may argue,
p182
aV"Well, maybe Country A is China
p183
aVand Country B is India."
p184
aVIn fact, Country A
p185
aVis democratic India,
p186
aVand Country B is Pakistan \u2014
p187
aVthe country that has a long period
p188
aVof military rule.
p189
aVAnd it's very common
p190
aVthat we compare India with China.
p191
aVThat's because the two countries
p192
aVhave about the same population size.
p193
aVBut the more natural comparison
p194
aVis actually between India and Pakistan.
p195
aVThose two countries are geographically similar.
p196
aVThey have a complicated, but shared common history.
p197
aVBy that comparison,
p198
aVdemocracy looks very, very good
p199
aVin terms of economic growth.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo why do economists fall in love
p202
aVwith authoritarian governments?
p203
aVOne reason is the East Asian Model.
p204
aVIn East Asia,
p205
aVwe have had successful economic growth stories
p206
aVsuch as Korea, Taiwan,
p207
aVHong Kong and Singapore.
p208
aVSome of these economies
p209
aVwere ruled by authoritarian governments
p210
aVin the 60s and 70s
p211
aVand 1980s.
p212
aVThe problem with that view
p213
aVis like asking all the winners of lotteries,
p214
aV"Have you won the lottery?"
p215
aVAnd they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."
p216
aVAnd then you draw the conclusion
p217
aVthe odds of winning the lottery
p218
aVare 100 percent.
p219
aVThe reason is you never go
p220
aVand bother to ask the losers
p221
aVwho also purchased lottery tickets
p222
aVand didn't end up winning the prize.
p223
aa(lp224
VFor each of these successful authoritarian governments
p225
aVin East Asia,
p226
aVthere's a matched failure.
p227
aVKorea succeeded, North Korea didn't.
p228
aVTaiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.
p229
aVBurma didn't succeed.
p230
aVThe Philippines didn't succeed.
p231
aVIf you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,
p232
aVthere's really no support for the idea
p233
aVthat authoritarian governments
p234
aVhold a systematic edge over democracies
p235
aVin terms of economic growth.
p236
aVSo the East Asian model
p237
aVhas this massive selection bias \u2014
p238
aVit is known as selecting on a dependent variable,
p239
aVsomething we always tell our students to avoid.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo exactly why did China grow so much faster?
p242
aVI will take you to the Cultural Revolution,
p243
aVwhen China went mad,
p244
aVand compare that country's performance with India
p245
aVunder Indira Gandhi.
p246
aVThe question there is: Which country did better,
p247
aVChina or India?
p248
aVChina was during the Cultural Revolution.
p249
aVIt turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,
p250
aVChina out-perfomed India
p251
aVin terms of GDP growth
p252
aVby an average of about 2.2 percent every year
p253
aVin terms of per capita GDP.
p254
aVSo that's when China was mad.
p255
aVThe whole country went mad.
p256
aVIt must mean that the country
p257
aVhad something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth
p258
aVto overcome the negative effects
p259
aVof the Cultural Revolution.
p260
aVThe advantage the country had
p261
aVwas human capital \u2014
p262
aVnothing else but human capital.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis is the world development index indicator data
p265
aVin the early 1990s.
p266
aVAnd this is the earliest data that I can find.
p267
aVThe adult literacy rate in China
p268
aVis 77 percent
p269
aVas compared with 48 percent in India.
p270
aVThe contrast in literacy rates
p271
aVis especially sharp
p272
aVbetween Chinese women and Indian women.
p273
aVI haven't told you about the definition of literacy.
p274
aVIn China, the definition of literacy
p275
aVis the ability to read and write
p276
aV1,500 Chinese characters.
p277
aVIn India, the definition of literacy,
p278
aVoperating definition of literacy,
p279
aVis the ability, the grand ability,
p280
aVto write your own name
p281
aVin whatever language you happen to speak.
p282
aVThe gap between the two countries in terms of literacy
p283
aVis much more substantial
p284
aVthan the data here indicated.
p285
aVIf you go to other sources of data
p286
aVsuch as Human Development Index,
p287
aVthat data series,
p288
aVgo back to the early 1970s,
p289
aVyou see exactly the same contrast.
p290
aVChina held a huge advantage
p291
aVin terms of human capital
p292
aVvis-a-vis India.
p293
aa(lp294
VLife expectancies:
p295
aVas early as 1965,
p296
aVChina had a huge advantage in life expectancy.
p297
aVOn average, as a Chinese in 1965,
p298
aVyou lived 10 years more
p299
aVthan an average Indian.
p300
aVSo if you have a choice
p301
aVbetween being a Chinese and being an Indian,
p302
aVyou would want to become a Chinese
p303
aVin order to live 10 years longer.
p304
aVIf you made that decision in 1965,
p305
aVthe down side of that
p306
aVis the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.
p307
aVSo you have to always think carefully
p308
aVabout these decisions.
p309
aa(lp310
VIf you cannot chose your nationality,
p311
aVthen you will want to become an Indian man.
p312
aVBecause, as an Indian man,
p313
aVyou have about two years of life expectancy advantage
p314
aVvis-a-vis Indian women.
p315
aVThis is an extremely strange fact.
p316
aVIt's very rare among countries
p317
aVto have this kind of pattern.
p318
aVIt shows the systematic discrimination and biases
p319
aVin the Indian society
p320
aVagainst women.
p321
aVThe good news is, by 2006,
p322
aVIndia has closed the gap
p323
aVbetween men and women
p324
aVin terms of life expectancy.
p325
aVToday, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge
p326
aVover Indian men.
p327
aVSo India is reverting to the normal.
p328
aVBut India still has a lot of work to do
p329
aVin terms of gender equality.
p330
aa(lp331
VThese are the two pictures
p332
aVtaken of garment factories in Guangdong Province
p333
aVand garment factories in India.
p334
aVIn China, it's all women.
p335
aV60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women
p336
aVin the coastal part of the country,
p337
aVwhereas in India, it's all men.
p338
aVFinancial Times printed this picture
p339
aVof an Indian textile factory
p340
aVwith the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."
p341
aVBy looking at these two pictures,
p342
aVI say no, it won't overtake China for a while.
p343
aVIf you look at other East Asian countries,
p344
aVwomen there play a hugely important role
p345
aVin terms of economic take-off \u2014
p346
aVin terms of creating the manufacturing miracle
p347
aVassociated with East Asia.
p348
aVIndia still has a long way to go
p349
aVto catch up with China.
p350
aa(lp351
VThen the issue is,
p352
aVwhat about the Chinese political system?
p353
aVYou talk about human capital,
p354
aVyou talk about education and public health.
p355
aVWhat about the political system?
p356
aVIsn't it true that the one-party political system
p357
aVhas facilitated economic growth in China?
p358
aVActually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.
p359
aVIt depends on a distinction that you draw
p360
aVbetween statics of the political system
p361
aVand the dynamics of the political system.
p362
aVStatically, China is a one-party system,
p363
aVauthoritarian \u2014 there's no question about it.
p364
aVDynamically, it has changed over time
p365
aVto become less authoritarian and more democratic.
p366
aVWhen you explain change \u2014
p367
aVfor example, economic growth;
p368
aVeconomic growth is about change \u2014
p369
aVwhen you explain change,
p370
aVyou use other things that have changed to explain change,
p371
aVrather than using the constant to explain change.
p372
aVSometimes a fixed effect can explain change,
p373
aVbut a fixed effect only explains changes
p374
aVin interaction with the things that change.
p375
aa(lp376
VIn terms of the political changes,
p377
aVthey have introduced village elections.
p378
aVThey have increased the security of proprietors.
p379
aVAnd they have increased the security
p380
aVwith long-term land leases.
p381
aVThere are also financial reforms in rural China.
p382
aVThere is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.
p383
aVTo me, the pace of political changes
p384
aVis too slow, too gradual.
p385
aVAnd my own view is the country
p386
aVis going to face some substantial challenges,
p387
aVbecause they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.
p388
aVBut nevertheless,
p389
aVthe system has moved in a more liberal direction,
p390
aVmoved in a more democratic direction.
p391
aa(lp392
VYou can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.
p393
aVIn fact, when India was growing
p394
aVat a Hindu rate of growth \u2014
p395
aVabout one percent, two percent a year \u2014
p396
aVthat was when India was least democratic.
p397
aVIndira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
p398
aVThe Indian government owned and operated
p399
aVall the TV stations.
p400
aVA little-known fact about India in the 1990s
p401
aVis that the country
p402
aVnot only has undertaken economic reforms,
p403
aVthe country has also undertaken political reforms
p404
aVby introducing village self-rule,
p405
aVprivatization of media
p406
aVand introducing freedom of information acts.
p407
aVSo the dynamic perspective
p408
aVfits both with China and in India
p409
aVin terms of the direction.
p410
aa(lp411
VWhy do many people believe
p412
aVthat India is still a growth disaster?
p413
aVOne reason
p414
aVis they are always comparing India with China.
p415
aVBut China is a superstar
p416
aVin terms of economic growth.
p417
aVIf you are a NBA player
p418
aVand you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,
p419
aVyou're going to look not so impressive.
p420
aVBut that doesn't mean
p421
aVthat you're a bad basketball player.
p422
aVComparing with a superstar
p423
aVis the wrong benchmark.
p424
aVIn fact, if you compare India
p425
aVwith the average developing country,
p426
aVeven before the more recent period
p427
aVof acceleration of Indian growth \u2014
p428
aVnow India is growing between eight and nine percent \u2014
p429
aVeven before this period,
p430
aVIndia was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth
p431
aVamong emerging economies.
p432
aVThis is a very impressive record indeed.
p433
aa(lp434
VLet's think about the future:
p435
aVthe dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.
p436
aVWhich country has the growth momentum?
p437
aVChina, I believe, still has
p438
aVsome of the excellent raw fundamentals \u2014
p439
aVmostly the social capital,
p440
aVthe public health,
p441
aVthe sense of egalitarianism
p442
aVthat you don't find in India.
p443
aVBut I believe that India has the momentum.
p444
aVIt has the improving fundamentals.
p445
aVThe government has invested in basic education,
p446
aVhas invested in basic health.
p447
aVI believe the government should do more,
p448
aVbut nevertheless, the direction it is moving in
p449
aVis the right direction.
p450
aVIndia has the right institutional conditions
p451
aVfor economic growth,
p452
aVwhereas China is still struggling
p453
aVwith political reforms.
p454
aa(lp455
VI believe that the political reforms are a must for China
p456
aVto maintain its growth.
p457
aVAnd it's very important to have political reforms,
p458
aVto have widely shared benefits of economic growth.
p459
aVI don't know whether that's going to happen or not,
p460
aVbut I'm an optimist.
p461
aVHopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal
p462
aVthat political reforms will happen in China.
p463
