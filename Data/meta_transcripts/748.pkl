VCan geographic information
p4
aVmake you healthy?
p5
aVIn 2001 I got hit by a train.
p6
aVMy train was a heart attack.
p7
aVI found myself in a hospital
p8
aVin an intensive-care ward,
p9
aVrecuperating from emergency surgery.
p10
aVAnd I suddenly realized something:
p11
aVthat I was completely in the dark.
p12
aVI started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
p13
aV"Why now?" "Why here?"
p14
aV"Could my doctor have warned me?"
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you
p17
aVis really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
p18
aVGenetics, lifestyle and environment.
p19
aVThat's going to sort of contain our risks,
p20
aVand if we manage those risks
p21
aVwe're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.
p22
aVWell, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.
p23
aVAnd you know why I understand that?
p24
aVBecause my physicians constantly
p25
aVask me questions about this.
p26
aa(lp27
VHave you ever had to fill out those long,
p28
aVlegal-size forms in your doctor's office?
p29
aVI mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVDo it over and over again. And they ask you questions
p32
aVabout your lifestyle and your family history,
p33
aVyour medication history, your surgical history,
p34
aVyour allergy history ... did I forget any history?
p35
aa(lp36
VBut this part of the equation I didn't really get,
p37
aVand I don't think my physicians
p38
aVreally get this part of the equation.
p39
aVWhat does that mean, my environment?
p40
aVWell, it can mean a lot of things.
p41
aVThis is my life. These are my life places.
p42
aVWe all have these.
p43
aVWhile I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:
p44
aVHow many places have you lived?
p45
aa(lp46
VJust think about that, you know, wander through
p47
aVyour life thinking about this.
p48
aVAnd you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
p49
aVYou spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
p50
aVAnd if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time
p51
aVtraveling some place.
p52
aVSo, it's not really simple
p53
aVwhen somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,
p54
aVand where do you spend all your time?
p55
aVAnd where do you expose yourselves to risks
p56
aVthat maybe perhaps you don't even see?"
p57
aVWell, when I have done this on myself,
p58
aVI always come to the conclusion
p59
aVthat I spend about 75 percent of my time
p60
aVrelatively in a small number of places.
p61
aVAnd I don't wander far from that place
p62
aVfor a majority of my time,
p63
aVeven though I'm an extensive global trekker.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.
p66
aVI started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
p67
aVI don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,
p68
aVbut this is where I spent my first 19 years
p69
aVwith my little young lungs.
p70
aVYou know, breathing high concentrations here
p71
aVof sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
p72
aVand methane gas,
p73
aVin unequal quantities \u2014 19 years of this.
p74
aVAnd if you've been in that part of the country,
p75
aVthis is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo then I decided to leave that part of the world,
p78
aVand I was going to go to the mid-west.
p79
aVOK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
p80
aVWell, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.
p81
aVThey manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene
p82
aVand benzene.
p83
aVOkay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,
p84
aVbreathing various concentrations of that.
p85
aVAnd on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.
p86
aVIt was insidious and it was really happening.
p87
aa(lp88
VThen I decided I had to get really smart,
p89
aVI would take this job in the West Coast.
p90
aVAnd I moved to Redlands California.
p91
aVVery nice, and there
p92
aVmy older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,
p93
aVI filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
p94
aVOkay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
p95
aVAlright, this is what it looks like on a good day.
p96
aVIf you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, what's wrong with this picture?
p99
aVWell, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
p100
aVThe one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:
p101
aVThey never ask me about my place history.
p102
aVNo doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,
p103
aV"Where have you lived?"
p104
aVThey haven't asked me what kind of the quality
p105
aVof the drinking water that I put in my mouth
p106
aVor the food that I ingest into my stomach.
p107
aVThey really don't do that. It's missing.
p108
aVLook at the kind of data that's available.
p109
aVThis data's from all over the world \u2014
p110
aVcountries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, I've circled the places where I've been.
p113
aVWell, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack
p114
aVI'd been in the right places. Right?
p115
aVSo, how many people are in the white?
p116
aVHow many people in the room have spent the majority of their life
p117
aVin the white space?
p118
aVAnybody? Boy you're lucky.
p119
aVHow many have spent it in the red places?
p120
aVOh, not so lucky.
p121
aVThere are thousands of these kinds of maps
p122
aVthat are displayed in atlases
p123
aVall over the world.
p124
aVThey give us some sense of what's going
p125
aVto be our train wreck.
p126
aVBut none of that's in my medical record.
p127
aVAnd it's not in yours either.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, here's my friend Paul.
p130
aVHe's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked
p131
aVevery two hours, 24/7,
p132
aV365 days out of the year
p133
aVfor the last two years, everywhere he went.
p134
aVAnd you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.
p135
aVAnd this is where he has spent most of his time.
p136
aVIf you really studied that you might have some clues
p137
aVas to what Paul likes to do.
p138
aVAnybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
p139
aVWe can zoom in here, and we suddenly see
p140
aVthat now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.
p141
aVAnd all of those black dots are all of the
p142
aVtoxic release inventories
p143
aVthat are monitored by the EPA.
p144
aa(lp145
VDid you know that data existed?
p146
aVFor every community in the United States,
p147
aVyou could have your own personalized map of that.
p148
aVSo, our cell phones can now build a place history.
p149
aVThis is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.
p150
aVThis might be what we end up with.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is what the physician would have
p153
aVin front of him and her when we enter that exam room
p154
aVinstead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?
p155
aVThis could be my little assessment.
p156
aVAnd he looks at that and he says,
p157
aV"Whoa Bill,
p158
aVI suggest that maybe you not decide,
p159
aVjust because you're out here in beautiful California,
p160
aVand it's warm every day,
p161
aVthat you get out and run at six o'clock at night.
p162
aVI'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,
p163
aVbecause of this report."
p164
aa(lp165
VWhat I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.
p166
aVOkay, number one is, we must teach physicians
p167
aVabout the value of geographical information.
p168
aVIt's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now
p169
aVthat are focused on this.
p170
aVAnd they're in the early stages of development.
p171
aVThese programs need to be supported,
p172
aVand we need to teach our future
p173
aVdoctors of the world
p174
aVthe importance of some of the information
p175
aVI've shared here with you today.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe second thing we need to do
p178
aVis while we're spending billions and billions
p179
aVof dollars all over the world
p180
aVbuilding an electronic health record,
p181
aVwe make sure we put a place history
p182
aVinside that medical record.
p183
aVIt not only will be important for the physician;
p184
aVit will be important for the researchers
p185
aVthat now will have huge samples to draw upon.
p186
aVBut it will also be useful for us.
p187
aVI could have made the decision, if I had this information,
p188
aVnot to move to the ozone capital
p189
aVof the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
p190
aVOr I could negotiate with my employer
p191
aVto make that decision
p192
aVin the best interest of myself and my company.
p193
aa(lp194
VWith that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said
p195
aVthis almost 10 years ago.
p196
aVJust look at that for a minute.
p197
aVThat was what the conclusion
p198
aVof the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,
p199
aVwas saying that we can explain the geographic variations
p200
aVthat occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,
p201
aVand how our healthcare system actually operates.
p202
aVThat was what he was talking about
p203
aVon that quote.
p204
aVAnd I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.
p205
aVSo, I'd very much like to see us begin to
p206
aVreally seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
p207
aVSo with that, I'll leave you that
p208
aVin my particular view of view of health:
p209
aVGeography always matters.
p210
aVAnd I believe that geographic information
p211
aVcan make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.
