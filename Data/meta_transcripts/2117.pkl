VHumanity takes center stage at TED,
p4
aVbut I would like to add  a voice for the animals,
p5
aVwhose bodies and minds  and spirits shaped us.

aa(lp7
VSome years ago, it was my good fortune
p8
aVto meet a tribal elder on an island
p9
aVnot far from Vancouver.
p10
aVHis name is Jimmy Smith,
p11
aVand he shared a story with me
p12
aVthat is told among his people,
p13
aVwho call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.
p14
aa(lp15
VOnce upon a time, he told me,
p16
aVall animals on Earth were one.
p17
aVEven though they look different on the outside,
p18
aVinside, they're all the same,
p19
aVand from time to time they would gather
p20
aVat a sacred cave deep inside the forest
p21
aVto celebrate their unity.
p22
aVWhen they arrived,
p23
aVthey would all take off their skins.
p24
aVRaven shed his feathers, bear his fur,
p25
aVand salmon her scales,
p26
aVand then, they would dance.
p27
aVBut one day, a human made it to the cave
p28
aVand laughed at what he saw
p29
aVbecause he did not understand.
p30
aVEmbarrassed, the animals fled,
p31
aVand that was the last time
p32
aVthey revealed themselves this way.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe ancient understanding that underneath
p35
aVtheir separate identities, all animals are one,
p36
aVhas been a powerful inspiration to me.
p37
aVI like to get past the fur, the feathers
p38
aVand the scales.
p39
aVI want to get under the skin.
p40
aVNo matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant
p41
aVor a tiny tree frog,
p42
aVmy goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.
p43
aa(lp44
VYou may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
p45
aVSure. People are always present in my photos,
p46
aVno matter whether they appear
p47
aVto portray tortoises
p48
aVor cougars
p49
aVor lions.
p50
aVYou just have to learn how  to look past their disguise.
p51
aa(lp52
VAs a photographer,
p53
aVI try to reach beyond the differences
p54
aVin our genetic makeup
p55
aVto appreciate all we have in common
p56
aVwith every other living thing.
p57
aVWhen I use my camera,
p58
aVI drop my skin
p59
aVlike the animals at that cave
p60
aVso I can show who they really are.
p61
aa(lp62
VAs animals blessed
p63
aVwith the power of rational thought,
p64
aVwe can marvel at the intricacies of life.
p65
aVAs citizens of a planet in trouble,
p66
aVit is our moral responsibility
p67
aVto deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
p68
aVBut as humans with hearts,
p69
aVwe can all rejoice in the unity of life,
p70
aVand perhaps we can change
p71
aVwhat once happened in that sacred cave.
p72
aa(lp73
VLet's find a way to join the dance.
p74
aa(lp75
VThank you.
