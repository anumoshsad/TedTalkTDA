VI want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,
p4
aVfrom when I was 12 years old.
p5
aVMy uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater \u2014
p6
aVat least I thought it was beautiful.
p7
aVAnd it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,
p8
aVand Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of
p9
aVright across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
p10
aVAnd I wore it whenever I could,
p11
aVthinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
p12
aa(lp13
VUntil one day in ninth grade,
p14
aVwhen I was standing with a number of the football players.
p15
aVAnd my body had clearly changed, and Matt,
p16
aVwho was undeniably my nemesis in high school,
p17
aVsaid in a booming voice that
p18
aVwe no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,
p19
aVbut we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVAnd I was so humiliated and mortified
p22
aVthat I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her
p23
aVfor ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
p24
aVWe drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away
p25
aVsomewhat ceremoniously,
p26
aVmy idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater
p27
aVnor see it ever again.
p28
aa(lp29
VFast forward \u2014 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.
p30
aVI'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,
p31
aVwhen I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy \u2014 11 years old \u2014
p32
aVrunning toward me, wearing my sweater.
p33
aVAnd I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
p34
aVBut so, curious, I run up to the child \u2014 of course
p35
aVscaring the living bejesus out of him \u2014
p36
aVgrab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name
p37
aVwritten on the collar of this sweater.
p38
aa(lp39
VI tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve
p40
aVas a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness
p41
aVthat we all have on this Earth.
p42
aVWe so often don't realize what our action and our inaction
p43
aVdoes to people we think we will never see and never know.
p44
aVI also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story
p45
aVof what aid is and can be.
p46
aVThat this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,
p47
aVand moved its way into the larger industry,
p48
aVwhich at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.
p49
aVWhich was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
p50
aVAnd at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,
p51
aVit destroyed the local retailing industry.
p52
aVNot to say that it shouldn't have,
p53
aVbut that we have to get better at answering the questions
p54
aVthat need to be considered when we think about consequences
p55
aVand responses.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,
p58
aVwhere I was doing two things.
p59
aVI had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
p60
aVWe were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was
p61
aVwe were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,
p62
aVwhich was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
p63
aVAnd because we had a good business model, we actually did it,
p64
aVand I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
p65
aVBut at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,
p66
aVand tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,
p67
aVwhich is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,
p68
aVwhich now is a worldwide movement \u2014 you talk about a meme \u2014
p69
aVbut then it was quite new, especially in an economy
p70
aVthat was moving from barter into trade.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe got a lot of things right.
p73
aVWe focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
p74
aVThe women made their own decisions at the end of the day
p75
aVas to how they would use this access to credit
p76
aVto build their little businesses, earn more income
p77
aVso they could take care of their families better.
p78
aa(lp79
VWhat we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,
p80
aVwith the confluence of fear, ethnic strife
p81
aVand certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into
p82
aVthis invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,
p83
aVthat at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
p84
aVThe genocide happened in 1994,
p85
aVseven years after these women all worked together
p86
aVto build this dream.
p87
aVAnd the good news was that the institution,
p88
aVthe banking institution, lasted.
p89
aVIn fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
p90
aVThe bakery was completely wiped out,
p91
aVbut the lessons for me were that accountability counts \u2014
p92
aVgot to build things with people on the ground,
p93
aVusing business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,
p94
aVthe incentives matter.
p95
aVUnderstand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything
p98
aVthat was happening in the world,
p99
aVthat we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,
p100
aVon the one hand I absolutely agree with him,
p101
aVand I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 \u2014
p102
aVthat the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono
p103
aVand Bob Geldof \u2014 the world is talking about global poverty;
p104
aVthe world is talking about Africa
p105
aVin ways I have never seen in my life.
p106
aVIt's thrilling.
p107
aVAnd at the same time, what keeps me up at night
p108
aVis a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 \u2014
p109
aV50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,
p110
aV40 billion in reduced debt \u2014 as the victory,
p111
aVas more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,
p114
aVcelebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two
p115
aVthat is all about execution, all about the how-to.
p116
aVAnd if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,
p117
aVit's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,
p118
aVis to build viable systems on the ground
p119
aVthat deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,
p120
aVin ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
p121
aVIf we do that, we really can make poverty history.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd it was that \u2014 that whole philosophy \u2014
p124
aVthat encouraged me to start my current endeavor
p125
aVcalled "Acumen Fund,"
p126
aVwhich is trying to build some mini-blueprints
p127
aVfor how we might do that in water, health and housing
p128
aVin Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
p129
aVAnd I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,
p130
aVso you can see what it is that we're doing.
p131
aVBut before I do this \u2014 and this is another one of my pet peeves \u2014
p132
aVI want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
p133
aVBecause we too often talk about them as these
p134
aVstrong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,
p135
aVwhen in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
p136
aVOn a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
p137
aa(lp138
VThat's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."
p139
aVIf you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,
p140
aVand yet most of these people go invisible.
p141
aVWhere we typically work, there's people making between
p142
aVone and three dollars a day.
p143
aVWho are these people?
p144
aVThey are farmers and factory workers.
p145
aVThey work in government offices. They're drivers.
p146
aVThey are domestics.
p147
aVThey typically pay for critical goods and services like water,
p148
aVlike healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times
p149
aVwhat their middleclass counterparts pay \u2014
p150
aVcertainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
p151
aVThe poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,
p152
aVif you give them that opportunity.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo, two examples.
p155
aVOne is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,
p156
aVmost of whom make less than two dollars a day.
p157
aVWhere we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
p158
aVYou see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
p159
aVThis guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
p160
aVWhat he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,
p161
aVand figure out how to do a drip irrigation,
p162
aVwhich is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
p163
aVBut previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,
p164
aVso Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
p165
aVA couple of principles:
p166
aVbuild small.
p167
aVMake it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
p168
aa(lp169
VThis family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit
p170
aVwhen they were living in a \u2014 literally a three-walled lean-to
p171
aVwith a corrugated iron roof.
p172
aVAfter one harvest, they had increased their income enough
p173
aVto buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
p174
aVA couple of years later, I meet them.
p175
aVThey now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,
p176
aVand they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid
p177
aVto build their house.
p178
aVAnd I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
p179
aVSomething I truly believe.
p180
aa(lp181
VYou can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,
p182
aVand I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
p183
aVhuge kudos for bringing to the world
p184
aVthis notion of his rage \u2014 for five dollars you can save a life.
p185
aVMalaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
p186
aV300 to 500 million cases are reported.
p187
aVIt's estimated that Africa loses
p188
aVabout 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
p189
aVFive dollars can save a life.
p190
aVWe can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars \u2014
p191
aVwhy can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
p192
aa(lp193
VThe question, though, is not "Why can't we?"
p194
aVThe question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
p195
aVA lot of hurdles.
p196
aVOne: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
p197
aVThree: this is a good road in \u2014 right near where our factory is located.
p198
aVDistribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
p199
aVWe started by making a 350,000-dollar loan
p200
aVto the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa
p201
aVso that they could transfer technology from Japan
p202
aVand build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
p203
aVHere are just some pictures of the factory.
p204
aa(lp205
VToday, three years later, the company has employed
p206
aVanother thousand women.
p207
aVIt contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
p208
aVIt's the largest company in Tanzania.
p209
aVThe throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,
p210
aVthree million by the end of the year.
p211
aVWe hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
p212
aVSo the production side is working.
p213
aVOn the distribution side, though,
p214
aVas a world, we have a lot of work to do.
p215
aVRight now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,
p216
aVand then given primarily to people around Africa.
p217
aVWe're looking at building
p218
aVon some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
p219
aVTheir women.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd so I want you to meet Jacqueline,
p222
aVmy namesake, 21 years old.
p223
aVIf she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,
p224
aVI'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
p225
aVShe runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money
p226
aVto put a down payment on her house.
p227
aVShe makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,
p228
aVand told me she is not marrying nor having children
p229
aVuntil these things are completed.
p230
aVAnd so, when I told her about our idea \u2014
p231
aVthat maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,
p232
aVand find a way for the women themselves to go out
p233
aVand sell these nets to others \u2014
p234
aVshe quickly started calculating what she herself could make
p235
aVand signed up.
p236
aa(lp237
VWe took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,
p238
aVand quickly did a prototyping on this,
p239
aVand took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
p240
aVShe brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts
p241
aVtogether to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,
p242
aVdespite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,
p243
aVand we learned a lot about how you sell things.
p244
aVNot coming in with our own notions,
p245
aVbecause she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
p246
aVFirst, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
p247
aVThese nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
p248
aVChildren can sleep through the night;
p249
aVthe house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
p250
aVAnd we've started making curtains,
p251
aVand not only is it beautiful, but people can see status \u2014
p252
aVthat you care about your children.
p253
aVOnly then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
p254
aVA lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell
p255
aVgoods and services to the poor.
p256
aa(lp257
VI want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity
p258
aVto make poverty history.
p259
aVTo do it right, we have to build business models that matter,
p260
aVthat are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,
p261
aVpeople all over the developing world
p262
aVwho fit in this category, to do it themselves.
p263
aVBecause at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
p264
aVIt's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,
p265
aVthat they want to make their own decisions;
p266
aVthey want to solve their own problems;
p267
aVand that by engaging with them,
p268
aVnot only do we create much more dignity for them,
p269
aVbut for us as well.
p270
aVAnd so I urge all of you to think next time
p271
aVas to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity
p272
aVthat we all have \u2014 to make poverty history \u2014
p273
aVby really becoming part of the process
p274
aVand moving away from an us-and-them world,
p275
aVand realizing that it's about all of us,
p276
aVand the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.
p277
aVThank you.
