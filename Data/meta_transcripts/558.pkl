VCollege presidents are not the first people who come to mind
p4
aVwhen the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.
p5
aVSo I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.
p6
aa(lp7
VThe story begins in the late '90s.
p8
aVI was invited to meet with leading educators
p9
aVfrom the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
p10
aVThey were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.
p11
aVSince education under the Soviet Union
p12
aVwas essentially propaganda
p13
aVserving the purposes of a state ideology,
p14
aVthey appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
p15
aVif they were to provide an education
p16
aVworthy of free men and women.
p17
aVGiven this rare opportunity
p18
aVto start fresh,
p19
aVthey chose liberal arts
p20
aVas the most compelling model
p21
aVbecause of its historic commitment
p22
aVto furthering its students' broadest intellectual,
p23
aVand deepest ethical potential.
p24
aa(lp25
VHaving made that decision
p26
aVthey came to the United States,
p27
aVhome of liberal arts education,
p28
aVto talk with some of us
p29
aVmost closely identified
p30
aVwith that kind of education.
p31
aVThey spoke with a passion, an urgency,
p32
aVan intellectual conviction
p33
aVthat, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,
p34
aVa dream long forgotten.
p35
aVFor, in truth, we had moved light years
p36
aVfrom the passions that animated them.
p37
aVBut for me, unlike them,
p38
aVin my world, the slate was not clean,
p39
aVand what was written on it was not encouraging.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn truth, liberal arts education
p42
aVno longer exists \u2014
p43
aVat least genuine liberal arts education \u2014 in this country.
p44
aVWe have professionalized liberal arts to the point
p45
aVwhere they no longer provide the breadth of application
p46
aVand the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
p47
aVthat is their signature.
p48
aVOver the past century
p49
aVthe expert has dethroned the educated generalist
p50
aVto become the sole model
p51
aVof intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)
p52
aa(lp53
VExpertise has for sure had its moments.
p54
aVBut the price of its dominance is enormous.
p55
aVSubject matters are broken up
p56
aVinto smaller and smaller pieces,
p57
aVwith increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.
p58
aVWe have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.
p59
aVYou may think you know what is going on
p60
aVin that Jane Austen novel \u2014
p61
aVthat is, until your first encounter
p62
aVwith postmodern deconstructionism.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe progression of today's college student
p65
aVis to jettison every interest except one.
p66
aVAnd within that one, to continually narrow the focus,
p67
aVlearning more and more about less and less;
p68
aVthis, despite the evidence all around us
p69
aVof the interconnectedness of things.
p70
aVLest you think I exaggerate,
p71
aVhere are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.
p72
aVAs one moves up the ladder,
p73
aVvalues other than technical competence
p74
aVare viewed with increasing suspicion.
p75
aVQuestions such as,
p76
aV"What kind of a world are we making?
p77
aVWhat kind of a world should we be making?
p78
aVWhat kind of a world can we be making?"
p79
aVare treated with more and more skepticism,
p80
aVand move off the table.
p81
aa(lp82
VIn so doing, the guardians of secular democracy
p83
aVin effect yield the connection
p84
aVbetween education and values
p85
aVto fundamentalists,
p86
aVwho, you can be sure,
p87
aVhave no compunctions about using education
p88
aVto further their values:
p89
aVthe absolutes of a theocracy.
p90
aVMeanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.
p91
aVEither we have lost touch with those values
p92
aVor, no better,
p93
aVbelieve they need not
p94
aVor cannot be taught.
p95
aVThis aversion to social values
p96
aVmay seem at odds with the explosion
p97
aVof community service programs.
p98
aVBut despite the attention paid to these efforts,
p99
aVthey remain emphatically extracurricular.
p100
aVIn effect, civic-mindedness is treated
p101
aVas outside the realm of what purports to be
p102
aVserious thinking and adult purposes.
p103
aVSimply put, when the impulse is to change the world,
p104
aVthe academy is more likely to engender
p105
aVa learned helplessness
p106
aVthan to create a sense of empowerment.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis brew \u2014 oversimplification of civic engagement,
p109
aVidealization of the expert,
p110
aVfragmentation of knowledge,
p111
aVemphasis on technical mastery,
p112
aVneutrality as a condition of academic integrity \u2014
p113
aVis toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections
p114
aVbetween education and the public good,
p115
aVbetween intellectual integrity
p116
aVand human freedom,
p117
aVwhich were at the heart \u2014
p118
aV(Applause) \u2014 of the challenge posed to and by
p119
aVmy European colleagues.
p120
aVWhen the astronomical distance
p121
aVbetween the realities of the academy
p122
aVand the visionary intensity of this challenge
p123
aVwere more than enough, I can assure you,
p124
aVto give one pause,
p125
aVwhat was happening outside higher education
p126
aVmade backing off unthinkable.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhether it was threats to the environment,
p129
aVinequities in the distribution of wealth,
p130
aVlack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy
p131
aVwith respect to the continuing uses of energy,
p132
aVwe were in desperate straits.
p133
aVAnd that was only the beginning.
p134
aVThe corrupting of our political life
p135
aVhad become a living nightmare;
p136
aVnothing was exempt \u2014
p137
aVseparation of powers, civil liberties,
p138
aVthe rule of law,
p139
aVthe relationship of church and state.
p140
aVAccompanied by a squandering
p141
aVof the nation's material wealth
p142
aVthat defied credulity.
p143
aVA harrowing predilection for the uses of force
p144
aVhad become commonplace,
p145
aVwith an equal distaste
p146
aVfor the alternative forms of influence.
p147
aVAt the same time, all of our firepower was impotent
p148
aVwhen it came to halting or even stemming
p149
aVthe slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.
p150
aa(lp151
VOur public education, once a model for the world,
p152
aVhas become most noteworthy
p153
aVfor its failures.
p154
aVMastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy
p155
aVeludes vast numbers of our students.
p156
aVDespite having a research establishment
p157
aVthat is the envy of the world,
p158
aVmore than half of the American public
p159
aVdon't believe in evolution.
p160
aVAnd don't press your luck
p161
aVabout how much those who do believe in it
p162
aVactually understand it.
p163
aa(lp164
VIncredibly, this nation,
p165
aVwith all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,
p166
aVseems utterly helpless
p167
aVto reverse the freefall in any of these areas.
p168
aVEqually startling, from my point of view,
p169
aVis the fact that no one
p170
aVwas drawing any connections
p171
aVbetween what is happening to the body politic,
p172
aVand what is happening in our leading educational institutions.
p173
aVWe may be at the top of the list
p174
aVwhen it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.
p175
aVWe are not even on the list
p176
aVwhen it comes to our responsibility
p177
aVfor the health of this democracy.
p178
aVWe are playing with fire.
p179
aVYou can be sure Jefferson knew
p180
aVwhat he was talking about when he said,
p181
aV"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free
p182
aVin a state of civilization,
p183
aVit expects what never was,
p184
aVand never will be."
p185
aV(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VOn a more personal note,
p188
aVthis betrayal of our principles,
p189
aVour decency, our hope,
p190
aVmade it impossible for me
p191
aVto avoid the question,
p192
aV"What will I say, years from now,
p193
aVwhen people ask, 'Where were you?'"
p194
aVAs president of a leading liberal arts college,
p195
aVfamous for its innovative history,
p196
aVthere were no excuses.
p197
aVSo the conversation began at Bennington.
p198
aVKnowing that if we were to regain
p199
aVthe integrity of liberal education,
p200
aVit would take radical rethinking
p201
aVof basic assumptions,
p202
aVbeginning with our priorities.
p203
aVEnhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
p204
aVThe accomplishment of civic virtue
p205
aVis tied to the uses of intellect and imagination
p206
aVat their most challenging.
p207
aa(lp208
VOur ways of approaching agency and authority
p209
aVturn inside out to reflect the reality
p210
aVthat no one has the answers
p211
aVto the challenges facing citizens in this century,
p212
aVand everyone has the responsibility
p213
aVfor trying and participating in finding them.
p214
aVBennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences
p215
aVas areas of immersion that acknowledge differences
p216
aVin personal and professional objectives.
p217
aVBut the balances redressed,
p218
aVour shared purposes assume an equal
p219
aVif not greater importance.
p220
aa(lp221
VWhen the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
p222
aVThe idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves \u2014
p223
aVfrom health and education
p224
aVto the uses of force \u2014
p225
aVthe organizers of the curriculum.
p226
aVThey would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.
p227
aVBut structures designed to connect, rather than divide
p228
aVmutually dependent circles,
p229
aVrather than isolating triangles.
p230
aVAnd the point is not to treat these topics
p231
aVas topics of study,
p232
aVbut as frameworks of action.
p233
aVThe challenge: to figure out what it will take
p234
aVto actually do something
p235
aVthat makes a significant and sustainable difference.
p236
aa(lp237
VContrary to widely held assumptions,
p238
aVan emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.
p239
aVThe importance of coming to grips with values like justice,
p240
aVequity, truth,
p241
aVbecomes increasingly evident
p242
aVas students discover that interest alone
p243
aVcannot tell them what they need to know
p244
aVwhen the issue is rethinking education,
p245
aVour approach to health,
p246
aVor strategies for achieving
p247
aVan economics of equity.
p248
aVThe value of the past also comes alive;
p249
aVit provides a lot of company.
p250
aVYou are not the first to try to figure this out,
p251
aVjust as you are unlikely to be the last.
p252
aVEven more valuable,
p253
aVhistory provides a laboratory
p254
aVin which we see played out
p255
aVthe actual, as well as the intended
p256
aVconsequences of ideas.
p257
aa(lp258
VIn the language of my students,
p259
aV"Deep thought matters
p260
aVwhen you're contemplating what to do
p261
aVabout things that matter."
p262
aVA new liberal arts that can support this
p263
aVaction-oriented curriculum
p264
aVhas begun to emerge.
p265
aVRhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words
p266
aVto maximum effect.
p267
aVDesign, the art of organizing the world of things.
p268
aVMediation and improvisation
p269
aValso assume a special place in this new pantheon.
p270
aVQuantitative reasoning attains its proper position
p271
aVat the heart of what it takes to manage change
p272
aVwhere measurement is crucial.
p273
aVAs is a capacity to discriminate
p274
aVsystematically between what is at the core
p275
aVand what is at the periphery.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd when making connections is of the essence,
p278
aVthe power of technology emerges with special intensity.
p279
aVBut so does the importance of content.
p280
aVThe more powerful our reach,
p281
aVthe more important the question "About what?"
p282
aVWhen improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,
p283
aVartists, at long last,
p284
aVtake their place at the table,
p285
aVwhen strategies of action are in the process of being designed.
p286
aVIn this dramatically expanded ideal
p287
aVof a liberal arts education
p288
aVwhere the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,
p289
aVknowledge honed outside the academy
p290
aVbecomes essential.
p291
aVSocial activists, business leaders,
p292
aVlawyers, politicians, professionals
p293
aVwill join the faculty as active and ongoing participants
p294
aVin this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
p295
aVStudents, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom
p296
aVto engage the world directly.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd of course, this new wine
p299
aVneeds new bottles
p300
aVif we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
p301
aVof this idea.
p302
aVThe most important discovery we made
p303
aVin our focus on public action
p304
aVwas to appreciate that the hard choices
p305
aVare not between good and evil,
p306
aVbut between competing goods.
p307
aVThis discovery is transforming.
p308
aVIt undercuts self-righteousness,
p309
aVradically alters the tone and character of controversy,
p310
aVand enriches dramatically
p311
aVthe possibilities for finding common ground.
p312
aVIdeology, zealotry,
p313
aVunsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.
p314
aVThis is a political education, to be sure.
p315
aVBut it is a politics of principle,
p316
aVnot of partisanship.
p317
aVSo the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
p318
aa(lp319
VOn the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card
p320
aVis the architect's sketch of a building
p321
aVopening in 2010
p322
aVthat is to be a center for the advancement
p323
aVof public action.
p324
aVThe center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.
p325
aVThink of it as a kind of secular church.
p326
aVThe words on the card describe what will happen inside.
p327
aVWe intend to turn the intellectual
p328
aVand imaginative power, passion and boldness
p329
aVof our students, faculty and staff
p330
aVto developing strategies
p331
aVfor acting on the critical challenges of our time.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo we are doing our job.
p334
aVWhile these past weeks have been a time
p335
aVof national exhilaration in this country,
p336
aVit would be tragic if you thought this meant
p337
aVyour job was done.
p338
aVThe glacial silence we have experienced
p339
aVin the face of the shredding of the constitution,
p340
aVthe unraveling of our public institutions,
p341
aVthe deterioration of our infrastructure
p342
aVis not limited to the universities.
p343
aVWe the people
p344
aVhave become inured to our own irrelevance
p345
aVwhen it comes to doing anything significant
p346
aVabout anything that matters
p347
aVconcerning governance,
p348
aVbeyond waiting another four years.
p349
aVWe persist also
p350
aVin being sidelined by the idea of the expert
p351
aVas the only one capable of coming up with answers,
p352
aVdespite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
p353
aa(lp354
VThe problem is there is no such thing
p355
aVas a viable democracy made up of experts,
p356
aVzealots, politicians and spectators.
p357
aV(Applause)
p358
aVPeople will continue and should continue
p359
aVto learn everything there is to know about something or other.
p360
aVWe actually do it all the time.
p361
aVAnd there will be and should be
p362
aVthose who spend a lifetime
p363
aVpursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.
p364
aVBut this single-mindedness will not yield
p365
aVthe flexibilities of mind,
p366
aVthe multiplicity of perspectives,
p367
aVthe capacities for collaboration and innovation
p368
aVthis country needs.
p369
aVThat is where you come in.
p370
aVWhat is certain is that the individual talent
p371
aVexhibited in such abundance here,
p372
aVneeds to turn its attention
p373
aVto that collaborative, messy, frustrating,
p374
aVcontentious and impossible world
p375
aVof politics and public policy.
p376
aVPresident Obama and his team
p377
aVsimply cannot do it alone.
p378
aa(lp379
VIf the question of where to start seems overwhelming
p380
aVyou are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.
p381
aVBeing overwhelmed is the first step
p382
aVif you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,
p383
aVon a scale that makes a difference.
p384
aVSo what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
p385
aVWell, you have two things.
p386
aVYou have a mind. And you have other people.
p387
aVStart with those, and change the world.
