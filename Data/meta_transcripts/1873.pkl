(lp3
VFive years ago, I was on a sabbatical,
p4
aVand I returned to the medical university
p5
aVwhere I studied.
p6
aVI saw real patients and I wore the white coat
p7
aVfor the first time in 17 years,
p8
aVin fact since I became a management consultant.
p9
aa(lp10
VThere were two things that surprised me
p11
aVduring the month I spent.
p12
aVThe first one was that the common theme
p13
aVof the discussions we had were hospital budgets
p14
aVand cost-cutting,
p15
aVand the second thing, which really bothered me,
p16
aVactually, was that several of the colleagues I met,
p17
aVformer friends from medical school,
p18
aVwho I knew to be some of the smartest,
p19
aVmost motivated, engaged and passionate people
p20
aVI'd ever met,
p21
aVmany of them had turned cynical, disengaged,
p22
aVor had distanced themselves from hospital management.
p23
aVSo with this focus on cost-cutting,
p24
aVI asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?
p25
aa(lp26
VMany countries that you represent
p27
aVand where I come from
p28
aVstruggle with the cost of healthcare.
p29
aVIt's a big part of the national budgets.
p30
aVAnd many different reforms aim at holding back this growth.
p31
aVIn some countries, we have long waiting times
p32
aVfor patients for surgery.
p33
aVIn other countries, new drugs are not being reimbursed,
p34
aVand therefore don't reach patients.
p35
aVIn several countries, doctors and nurses
p36
aVare the targets, to some extent, for the governments.
p37
aVAfter all, the costly decisions in health care
p38
aVare taken by doctors and nurses.
p39
aVYou choose an expensive lab test,
p40
aVyou choose to operate on an old and frail patient.
p41
aVSo, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,
p42
aVthis is a way to hold costs down.
p43
aVAnd ultimately, some physicians will say today
p44
aVthat they don't have the full liberty
p45
aVto make the choices they think are right for their patients.
p46
aVSo no wonder that some of my old colleagues
p47
aVare frustrated.
p48
aa(lp49
VAt BCG, we looked at this,
p50
aVand we asked ourselves,
p51
aVthis can't be the right way of managing healthcare.
p52
aVAnd so we took a step back and we said,
p53
aV"What is it that we are trying to achieve?"
p54
aVUltimately, in the healthcare system,
p55
aVwe're aiming at improving health for the patients,
p56
aVand we need to do so at a limited,
p57
aVor affordable, cost.
p58
aVWe call this value-based healthcare.
p59
aVOn the screen behind me, you see what we mean
p60
aVby value:
p61
aVoutcomes that matter to patients
p62
aVrelative to the money we spend.
p63
aVThis was described beautifully in a book in 2006
p64
aVby Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.
p65
aa(lp66
VOn this picture, you have my father-in-law
p67
aVsurrounded by his three beautiful daughters.
p68
aVWhen we started doing our research at BCG,
p69
aVwe decided not to look so much at the costs,
p70
aVbut to look at the quality instead,
p71
aVand in the research, one of the things
p72
aVthat fascinated us was the variation we saw.
p73
aVYou compare hospitals in a country,
p74
aVyou'll find some that are extremely good,
p75
aVbut you'll find a large number that are vastly much worse.
p76
aVThe differences were dramatic.
p77
aVErik, my father-in-law,
p78
aVhe suffers from prostate cancer,
p79
aVand he probably needs surgery.
p80
aVNow living in Europe, he can choose to go to Germany
p81
aVthat has a well-reputed healthcare system.
p82
aVIf he goes there and goes to the average hospital,
p83
aVhe will have the risk of becoming incontinent
p84
aVby about 50 percent,
p85
aVso he would have to start wearing diapers again.
p86
aVYou flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.
p87
aVIf he instead would go to Hamburg,
p88
aVand to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,
p89
aVthe risk would be only one in 20.
p90
aVEither you a flip a coin,
p91
aVor you have a one in 20 risk.
p92
aVThat's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.
p93
aVWhen we look at many hospitals
p94
aVfor many different diseases,
p95
aVwe see these huge differences.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut you and I don't know. We don't have the data.
p98
aVAnd often, the data actually doesn't exist.
p99
aVNobody knows.
p100
aVSo going the hospital is a lottery.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.
p103
aVIn the late '70s, there were a group
p104
aVof Swedish orthopedic surgeons
p105
aVwho met at their annual meeting,
p106
aVand they were discussing the different procedures
p107
aVthey used to operate hip surgery.
p108
aVTo the left of this slide, you see a variety
p109
aVof metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use
p110
aVfor somebody who needs a new hip.
p111
aVThey all realized they had their individual way of operating.
p112
aVThey all argued that, "My technique is the best,"
p113
aVbut none of them actually knew, and they admitted that.
p114
aVSo they said, "We probably need to measure quality
p115
aVso we know and can learn from what's best."
p116
aVSo they in fact spent two years debating,
p117
aV"So what is quality in hip surgery?"
p118
aV"Oh, we should measure this." "No, we should measure that."
p119
aVAnd they finally agreed.
p120
aVAnd once they had agreed, they started measuring,
p121
aVand started sharing the data.
p122
aVVery quickly, they found that if you put cement
p123
aVin the bone of the patient
p124
aVbefore you put the metal shaft in,
p125
aVit actually lasted a lot longer,
p126
aVand most patients would never have to be
p127
aVre-operated on in their lifetime.
p128
aVThey published the data,
p129
aVand it actually transformed clinical practice in the country.
p130
aVEverybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
p131
aVSince then, they publish every year.
p132
aVOnce a year, they publish the league table:
p133
aVwho's best, who's at the bottom?
p134
aVAnd they visit each other to try to learn,
p135
aVso a continuous cycle of improvement.
p136
aVFor many years, Swedish hip surgeons
p137
aVhad the best results in the world,
p138
aVat least for those who actually were measuring,
p139
aVand many were not.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow I found this principle really exciting.
p142
aVSo the physicians get together,
p143
aVthey agree on what quality is,
p144
aVthey start measuring, they share the data,
p145
aVthey find who's best, and they learn from it.
p146
aVContinuous improvement.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, that's not the only exciting part.
p149
aVThat's exciting in itself.
p150
aVBut if you bring back the cost side of the equation,
p151
aVand look at that,
p152
aVit turns out, those who have focused on quality,
p153
aVthey actually also have the lowest costs,
p154
aValthough that's not been the purpose in the first place.
p155
aVSo if you look at the hip surgery story again,
p156
aVthere was a study done a couple years ago
p157
aVwhere they compared the U.S. and Sweden.
p158
aVThey looked at how many patients have needed
p159
aVto be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.
p160
aVIn the United States, the number was three times
p161
aVhigher than in Sweden.
p162
aVSo many unnecessary surgeries,
p163
aVand so much unnecessary suffering
p164
aVfor all the patients who were operated on
p165
aVin that seven year period.
p166
aVNow, you can imagine how much savings
p167
aVthere would be for society.
p168
aa(lp169
VWe did a study where we looked at OECD data.
p170
aVOECD does, every so often,
p171
aVlook at quality of care
p172
aVwhere they can find the data across the member countries.
p173
aVThe United States has, for many diseases,
p174
aVactually a quality which is below the average
p175
aVin OECD.
p176
aVNow, if the American healthcare system
p177
aVwould focus a lot more on measuring quality,
p178
aVand raise quality just to the level of average OECD,
p179
aVit would save the American people
p180
aV500 billion U.S. dollars a year.
p181
aVThat's 20 percent of the budget,
p182
aVof the healthcare budget of the country.
p183
aa(lp184
VNow you may say that these numbers
p185
aVare fantastic, and it's all logical,
p186
aVbut is it possible?
p187
aVThis would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,
p188
aVand I would argue that not only can it be done,
p189
aVbut it has to be done.
p190
aVThe agents of change are the doctors and nurses
p191
aVin the healthcare system.
p192
aa(lp193
VIn my practice as a consultant,
p194
aVI meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred
p195
aVdoctors and nurses and other hospital
p196
aVor healthcare staff every year.
p197
aVThe one thing they have in common is
p198
aVthey really care about what they achieve
p199
aVin terms of quality for their patients.
p200
aVPhysicians are, like most of you in the audience,
p201
aVvery competitive.
p202
aVThey were always best in class.
p203
aVWe were always best in class.
p204
aVAnd if somebody can show them that the result
p205
aVthey perform for their patients
p206
aVis no better than what others do,
p207
aVthey will do whatever it takes to improve.
p208
aVBut most of them don't know.
p209
aVBut physicians have another characteristic.
p210
aVThey actually thrive from peer recognition.
p211
aVIf a cardiologist calls another cardiologist
p212
aVin a competing hospital
p213
aVand discusses why that other hospital
p214
aVhas so much better results, they will share.
p215
aVThey will share the information on how to improve.
p216
aVSo it is, by measuring and creating transparency,
p217
aVyou get a cycle of continuous improvement,
p218
aVwhich is what this slide shows.
p219
aa(lp220
VNow, you may say this is a nice idea,
p221
aVbut this isn't only an idea.
p222
aVThis is happening in reality.
p223
aVWe're creating a global community,
p224
aVand a large global community,
p225
aVwhere we'll be able to measure and compare
p226
aVwhat we achieve.
p227
aVTogether with two academic institutions,
p228
aVMichael Porter at Harvard Business School,
p229
aVand the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,
p230
aVBCG has formed something we call ICHOM.
p231
aVYou may think that's a sneeze,
p232
aVbut it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.
p233
aVIt stands for the International Consortium
p234
aVfor Health Outcome Measurement.
p235
aVWe're bringing together leading physicians
p236
aVand patients to discuss, disease by disease,
p237
aVwhat is really quality,
p238
aVwhat should we measure,
p239
aVand to make those standards global.
p240
aVThey've worked \u2014 four working groups have worked
p241
aVduring the past year:
p242
aVcataracts, back pain,
p243
aVcoronary artery disease, which is, for instance, heart attack,
p244
aVand prostate cancer.
p245
aVThe four groups will publish their data
p246
aVin November of this year.
p247
aVThat's the first time we'll be comparing
p248
aVapples to apples, not only within a country,
p249
aVbut between countries.
p250
aVNext year, we're planning to do eight diseases,
p251
aVthe year after, 16.
p252
aVIn three years' time, we plan to have covered
p253
aV40 percent of the disease burden.
p254
aVCompare apples to apples. Who's better?
p255
aVWhy is that?
p256
aa(lp257
VFive months ago,
p258
aVI led a workshop at the largest university hospital
p259
aVin Northern Europe.
p260
aVThey have a new CEO, and she has a vision:
p261
aVI want to manage my big institution much more
p262
aVon quality, outcomes that matter to patients.
p263
aVThis particular day, we sat in a workshop
p264
aVtogether with physicians, nurses and other staff,
p265
aVdiscussing leukemia in children.
p266
aVThe group discussed,
p267
aVhow do we measure quality today?
p268
aVCan we measure it better than we do?
p269
aVWe discussed, how do we treat these kids,
p270
aVwhat are important improvements?
p271
aVAnd we discussed what are the costs for these patients,
p272
aVcan we do treatment more efficiently?
p273
aVThere was an enormous energy in the room.
p274
aVThere were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.
p275
aVAt the end of the meeting,
p276
aVthe chairman of the department, he stood up.
p277
aVHe looked over the group and he said \u2014
p278
aVfirst he raised his hand, I forgot that \u2014
p279
aVhe raised his hand, clenched his fist,
p280
aVand then he said to the group, "Thank you.
p281
aVThank you. Today, we're finally discussing
p282
aVwhat this hospital does the right way."
p283
aa(lp284
VBy measuring value in healthcare,
p285
aVthat is not only costs
p286
aVbut outcomes that matter to patients,
p287
aVwe will make staff in hospitals
p288
aVand elsewhere in the healthcare system
p289
aVnot a problem but an important part of the solution.
p290
aVI believe measuring value in healthcare
p291
aVwill bring about a revolution,
p292
aVand I'm convinced that the founder
p293
aVof modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,
p294
aVwho always put the patient at the center,
p295
aVhe would smile in his grave.
p296
aa(lp297
VThank you.
