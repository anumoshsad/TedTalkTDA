VYou should be nice
p4
aVto nerds.
p5
aVIn fact, I'd go so far as to say,
p6
aVif you don't already have a nerd in your life,
p7
aVyou should get one.
p8
aVI'm just saying.
p9
aVScientists and engineers
p10
aVchange the world.
p11
aVI'd like to tell you
p12
aVabout a magical place called DARPA
p13
aVwhere scientists and engineers
p14
aVdefy the impossible
p15
aVand refuse to fear failure.
p16
aVNow these two ideas
p17
aVare connected more than you may realize,
p18
aVbecause when you remove the fear of failure,
p19
aVimpossible things
p20
aVsuddenly become possible.
p21
aa(lp22
VIf you want to know how,
p23
aVask yourself this question:
p24
aVWhat would you attempt to do
p25
aVif you knew you could not fail?
p26
aVIf you really ask yourself
p27
aVthis question,
p28
aVyou can't help but feel uncomfortable.
p29
aVI feel a little uncomfortable.
p30
aVBecause when you ask it,
p31
aVyou begin to understand
p32
aVhow the fear of failure constrains you,
p33
aVhow it keeps us
p34
aVfrom attempting great things,
p35
aVand life gets dull,
p36
aVamazing things stop happening.
p37
aVSure, good things happen,
p38
aVbut amazing things
p39
aVstop happening.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow I should be clear,
p42
aVI'm not encouraging failure,
p43
aVI'm discouraging
p44
aVfear of failure.
p45
aVBecause it's not failure itself
p46
aVthat constrains us.
p47
aVThe path to truly new,
p48
aVnever-been-done-before things
p49
aValways has failure along the way.
p50
aVWe're tested.
p51
aVAnd in part, that testing feels an appropriate part
p52
aVof achieving something great.
p53
aVClemenceau said,
p54
aV"Life gets interesting when we fail,
p55
aVbecause it's a sign
p56
aVthat we've surpassed ourselves."
p57
aa(lp58
VIn 1895,
p59
aVLord Kelvin declared
p60
aVthat heavier-than-air flying machines
p61
aVwere impossible.
p62
aVIn October of 1903,
p63
aVthe prevailing opinion
p64
aVof expert aerodynamicists
p65
aVwas that maybe in 10 million years
p66
aVwe could build an aircraft that would fly.
p67
aVAnd two months later on December 17th,
p68
aVOrville Wright powered the first airplane
p69
aVacross a beach in North Carolina.
p70
aVThe flight lasted 12 seconds
p71
aVand covered 120 feet.
p72
aVThat was 1903.
p73
aa(lp74
VOne year later,
p75
aVthe next declarations of impossibilities began.
p76
aVFerdinand Foch, a French army general
p77
aVcredited with having one of the most original and subtle minds
p78
aVin the French army,
p79
aVsaid, "Airplanes are interesting toys,
p80
aVbut of no military value."
p81
aV40 years later,
p82
aVaero experts coined the term transonic.
p83
aVThey debated, should it have one S or two?
p84
aVYou see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,
p85
aVand it wasn't at all clear
p86
aVthat we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
p87
aVIn 1947,
p88
aVthere was no wind tunnel data
p89
aVbeyond Mach 0.85.
p90
aVAnd yet,
p91
aVon Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,
p92
aVChuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit
p93
aVof his Bell X-1
p94
aVand he flew
p95
aVtowards an unknown possibility,
p96
aVand in so doing,
p97
aVhe became the first pilot
p98
aVto fly faster than the speed of sound.
p99
aVSix of eight Atlas rockets
p100
aVblew up on the pad.
p101
aVAfter 11 complete mission failures,
p102
aVwe got our first images from space.
p103
aVAnd on that first flight
p104
aVwe got more data
p105
aVthan in all U-2 missions combined.
p106
aVIt took a lot of failures
p107
aVto get there.
p108
aa(lp109
VSince we took to the sky,
p110
aVwe have wanted to fly
p111
aVfaster and farther.
p112
aVAnd to do so,
p113
aVwe've had to believe in impossible things.
p114
aVAnd we've had to refuse
p115
aVto fear failure.
p116
aVThat's still true today.
p117
aVToday, we don't talk about flying transonically,
p118
aVor even supersonically,
p119
aVwe talk about flying hypersonically \u2014
p120
aVnot Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.
p121
aVAt Mach 20,
p122
aVwe can fly from New York to Long Beach
p123
aVin 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
p124
aVAt that speed,
p125
aVthe surface of the airfoil
p126
aVis the temperature of molten steel \u2014
p127
aV3,500 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014
p128
aVlike a blast furnace.
p129
aVWe are essentially burning the airfoil
p130
aVas we fly it.
p131
aVAnd we are flying it,
p132
aVor trying to.
p133
aa(lp134
VDARPA's hypersonic test vehicle
p135
aVis the fastest maneuvering aircraft
p136
aVever built.
p137
aVIt's boosted to near-space
p138
aVatop a Minotaur IV rocket.
p139
aVNow the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,
p140
aVso we have to bleed it off
p141
aVby flying the rocket
p142
aVat an 89 degree angle of attack
p143
aVfor portions of the trajectory.
p144
aVThat's an unnatural act
p145
aVfor a rocket.
p146
aVThe third stage has a camera.
p147
aVWe call it rocketcam.
p148
aVAnd it's pointed
p149
aVat the hypersonic glider.
p150
aVThis is the actual rocketcam footage
p151
aVfrom flight one.
p152
aVNow to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.
p153
aVBut this is what it looks like
p154
aVfrom the third stage of the rocket
p155
aVlooking at the unmanned glider
p156
aVas it heads into the atmosphere
p157
aVback towards Earth.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe've flown twice.
p160
aVIn the first flight,
p161
aVno aerodynamic control of the vehicle.
p162
aVBut we collected more hypersonic flight data
p163
aVthan in 30 years
p164
aVof ground-based testing combined.
p165
aVAnd in the second flight,
p166
aVthree minutes of fully-controlled,
p167
aVaerodynamic flight
p168
aVat Mach 20.
p169
aVWe must fly again,
p170
aVbecause amazing, never-been-done-before things
p171
aVrequire that you fly.
p172
aVYou can't learn to fly at Mach 20
p173
aVunless you fly.
p174
aVAnd while there's no substitute for speed,
p175
aVmaneuverability is a very close second.
p176
aa(lp177
VIf a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds
p178
aVto get from New York to Long Beach,
p179
aVa hummingbird would take,
p180
aVwell, days.
p181
aVYou see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,
p182
aVbut they are maneuverable.
p183
aVIn fact, the hummingbird is the only bird
p184
aVthat can fly backwards.
p185
aVIt can fly up, down,
p186
aVforwards, backwards,
p187
aVeven upside-down.
p188
aVAnd so if we wanted to fly in this room
p189
aVor places where humans can't go,
p190
aVwe'd need an aircraft
p191
aVsmall enough and maneuverable enough
p192
aVto do so.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis is a hummingbird drone.
p195
aVIt can fly in all directions,
p196
aVeven backwards.
p197
aVIt can hover and rotate.
p198
aVThis prototype aircraft
p199
aVis equipped with a video camera.
p200
aVIt weighs less than one AA battery.
p201
aVIt does not eat nectar.
p202
aVIn 2008,
p203
aVit flew for a whopping 20 seconds,
p204
aVa year later, two minutes,
p205
aVthen six,
p206
aVeventually 11.
p207
aVMany prototypes crashed \u2014 many.
p208
aVBut there's no way
p209
aVto learn to fly like a hummingbird
p210
aVunless you fly.
p211
aV(Applause)
p212
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it.
p213
aVWow.
p214
aVIt's great.
p215
aVMatt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.
p216
aV(Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VFailure is part of creating
p219
aVnew and amazing things.
p220
aVWe cannot both fear failure
p221
aVand make amazing new things \u2014
p222
aVlike a robot
p223
aVwith the stability of a dog on rough terrain,
p224
aVor maybe even ice;
p225
aVa robot that can run like a cheetah,
p226
aVor climb stairs like a human
p227
aVwith the occasional clumsiness of a human.
p228
aVOr perhaps, Spider Man
p229
aVwill one day be Gecko Man.
p230
aVA gecko can support
p231
aVits entire body weight
p232
aVwith one toe.
p233
aVOne square millimeter of a gecko's footpad
p234
aVhas 14,000 hair-like structures
p235
aVcalled setae.
p236
aVThey are used to help it grip to surfaces
p237
aVusing intermolecular forces.
p238
aa(lp239
VToday we can manufacture structures
p240
aVthat mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.
p241
aVThe result,
p242
aVa four-by-four-inch
p243
aVartificial nano-gecko adhesive.
p244
aVcan support a static load
p245
aVof 660 pounds.
p246
aVThat's enough to stick
p247
aVsix 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,
p248
aVno nails.
p249
aVSo much for Velcro, right?
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd it's not just passive structures,
p252
aVit's entire machines.
p253
aVThis is a spider mite.
p254
aVIt's one millimeter long,
p255
aVbut it looks like Godzilla
p256
aVnext to these micromachines.
p257
aVIn the world of Godzilla spider mites,
p258
aVwe can make millions of mirrors,
p259
aVeach one-fifth the diameter
p260
aVof a human hair,
p261
aVmoving at hundreds of thousands of times per second
p262
aVto make large screen displays,
p263
aVso that we can watch movies like "Godzilla"
p264
aVin high-def.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd if we can build machines
p267
aVat that scale,
p268
aVwhat about Eiffel Tower-like trusses
p269
aVat the microscale?
p270
aVToday we are making metals
p271
aVthat are lighter than Styrofoam,
p272
aVso light
p273
aVthey can sit atop a dandelion puff
p274
aVand be blown away
p275
aVwith a wisp of air \u2014
p276
aVso light
p277
aVthat you can make a car that two people can lift,
p278
aVbut so strong
p279
aVthat it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.
p280
aa(lp281
VFrom the smallest wisp of air
p282
aVto the powerful forces of nature's storms.
p283
aVThere are 44 lightning strikes per second
p284
aVaround the globe.
p285
aVEach lightning bolt heats the air
p286
aVto 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014
p287
aVhotter than the surface of the Sun.
p288
aVWhat if we could use
p289
aVthese electromagnetic pulses
p290
aVas beacons,
p291
aVbeacons in a moving network
p292
aVof powerful transmitters?
p293
aVExperiments suggest
p294
aVthat lightning could be the next GPS.
p295
aa(lp296
VElectrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.
p297
aVUsing a grid the size of your thumb,
p298
aVwith 32 electrodes
p299
aVon the surface of his brain,
p300
aVTim uses his thoughts
p301
aVto control an advanced prosthetic arm.
p302
aVAnd his thoughts
p303
aVmade him reach for Katie.
p304
aVThis is the first time
p305
aVa human has controlled a robot
p306
aVwith thought alone.
p307
aVAnd it is the first time
p308
aVthat Tim has held Katie's hand
p309
aVin seven years.
p310
aVThat moment mattered
p311
aVto Tim and Katie,
p312
aVand this green goo
p313
aVmay someday matter to you.
p314
aVThis green goo
p315
aVis perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
p316
aVIt was made in tobacco plants.
p317
aVTobacco plants
p318
aVcan make millions of doses of vaccine
p319
aVin weeks instead of months,
p320
aVand it might just be
p321
aVthe first healthy use of tobacco ever.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd if it seems far-fetched
p324
aVthat tobacco plants could make people healthy,
p325
aVwhat about gamers that could solve problems
p326
aVthat experts can't solve?
p327
aVLast September,
p328
aVthe gamers of Foldit
p329
aVsolved the three-dimensional structure
p330
aVof the retroviral protease
p331
aVthat contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.
p332
aVNow understanding this structure
p333
aVis very important for developing treatments.
p334
aVFor 15 years,
p335
aVit was unsolved
p336
aVin the scientific community.
p337
aVThe gamers of Foldit
p338
aVsolved it in 15 days.
p339
aVNow they were able to do so
p340
aVby working together.
p341
aVThey were able to work together
p342
aVbecause they're connected by the Internet.
p343
aVAnd others, also connected to the Internet,
p344
aVused it as an instrument of democracy.
p345
aVAnd together
p346
aVthey changed the fate of their nation.
p347
aa(lp348
VThe Internet is home to two billion people,
p349
aVor 30 percent of the world's population.
p350
aVIt allows us to contribute
p351
aVand to be heard
p352
aVas individuals.
p353
aVIt allows us to amplify
p354
aVour voices and our power
p355
aVas a group.
p356
aVBut it too had humble beginnings.
p357
aVIn 1969, the internet was but a dream,
p358
aVa few sketches on a piece of paper.
p359
aVAnd then on October 29th,
p360
aVthe first packet-switched message was sent
p361
aVfrom UCLA to SRI.
p362
aVThe first two letters of the word "Login,"
p363
aVthat's all that made it through \u2014
p364
aVan L and an O \u2014
p365
aVand then a buffer overflow crashed the system.
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aVTwo letters,
p368
aVan L and an O,
p369
aVnow a worldwide force.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo who are these scientists and engineers
p372
aVat a magical place called DARPA?
p373
aVThey are nerds,
p374
aVand they are heroes among us.
p375
aVThey challenge existing perspectives
p376
aVat the edges of science
p377
aVand under the most demanding of conditions.
p378
aVThey remind us
p379
aVthat we can change the world
p380
aVif we defy the impossible
p381
aVand we refuse to fear failure.
p382
aVThey remind us
p383
aVthat we all have nerd power.
p384
aVSometimes we just forget.
p385
aa(lp386
VYou see, there was a time
p387
aVwhen you weren't afraid of failure,
p388
aVwhen you were a great artist or a great dancer
p389
aVand you could sing, you were good at math,
p390
aVyou could build things, you were an astronaut,
p391
aVan adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,
p392
aVyou could jump higher, run faster,
p393
aVkick harder than anyone.
p394
aVYou believed in impossible things
p395
aVand you were fearless.
p396
aVYou were totally and completely in touch
p397
aVwith your inner superhero.
p398
aVScientists and engineers
p399
aVcan indeed change the world.
p400
aVSo can you.
p401
aVYou were born to.
p402
aVSo go ahead,
p403
aVask yourself,
p404
aVwhat would you attempt to do
p405
aVif you knew you could not fail?
p406
aa(lp407
VNow I want to say,
p408
aVthis is not easy.
p409
aVIt's hard to hold onto this feeling,
p410
aVreally hard.
p411
aVI guess in some way,
p412
aVI sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.
p413
aVDoubt and fear always creep in.
p414
aVWe think someone else, someone smarter than us,
p415
aVsomeone more capable,
p416
aVsomeone with more resources will solve that problem.
p417
aVBut there isn't anyone else;
p418
aVthere's just you.
p419
aVAnd if we're lucky,
p420
aVin that moment,
p421
aVsomeone steps into that doubt and fear,
p422
aVtakes a hand and says,
p423
aV"Let me help you believe."
p424
aa(lp425
VJason Harley did that for me.
p426
aVJason started at DARPA
p427
aVon March 18th, 2010.
p428
aVHe was with our transportation team.
p429
aVI saw Jason nearly every day,
p430
aVsometimes twice a day.
p431
aVAnd more so than most,
p432
aVhe saw the highs and the lows,
p433
aVthe celebrations and the disappointments.
p434
aVAnd on one particularly dark day for me,
p435
aVJason sat down
p436
aVand he wrote an email.
p437
aVHe was encouraging,
p438
aVbut firm.
p439
aVAnd when he hit send,
p440
aVhe probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.
p441
aVIt mattered to me.
p442
aVIn that moment
p443
aVand still today
p444
aVwhen I doubt,
p445
aVwhen I feel afraid,
p446
aVwhen I need to reconnect
p447
aVwith that feeling,
p448
aVI remember his words,
p449
aVthey were so powerful.
p450
aa(lp451
VText: "There is only time enough to iron your cape
p452

p467
aV(Applause)
p468
aVThank you. Thank you.
p469
aa(lp470
V(Applause)
p471
aa(lp472
VChris Anderson: Regina, thank you.
p473
aVI have a couple of questions.
p474
aVSo that glider of yours,
p475
aVthe Mach 20 glider,
p476
aVthe first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.
p477
aa(lp478
VRD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?)
p479
aVYeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?)
p480
aVWe didn't fly it into the Pacific.
p481
aVNo, there are multiple portions of the trajectory
p482
aVthat are demanding
p483
aVin terms of really flying at that speed.
p484
aVAnd so in the second flight,
p485
aVwe were able to get three minutes
p486
aVof fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.
p487
aa(lp488
VCA: I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service
p489
aVfrom New York to Long Beach anytime soon.
p490
aa(lp491
VRD: It might be a little warm.
p492
aa(lp493
VCA: What do you picture that glider being used for?
p494
aa(lp495
VRD: Well our responsibility
p496
aVis to develop the technology for this.
p497
aVHow it's ultimately used
p498
aVwill be determined by the military.
p499
aVNow the purpose of the vehicle though,
p500
aVthe purpose of the technology,
p501
aVis to be able to reach anywhere in the world
p502
aVin less than 60 minutes.
p503
aa(lp504
VCA: And to carry a payload
p505
aVof more than a few pounds? (RD: Yeah.)
p506
aVLike what's the payload it could carry?
p507
aa(lp508
VRD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
p509
aVWe've got to fly it first.
p510
aa(lp511
VCA: But not necessarily just a camera?
p512
aa(lp513
VRD: No, not necessarily just a camera.
p514
aa(lp515
VCA: It's amazing.
p516
aVThe hummingbird?
p517
aa(lp518
VRD: Yeah?
p519
aa(lp520
VCA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight
p521
aVwith a plane kind of trying to flap its wings
p522
aVand failing horribly,
p523
aVand there haven't been that many planes built since
p524
aVthat flap wings.
p525
aVWhy did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry
p526
aVand copy a hummingbird?
p527
aVIsn't that a very expensive solution
p528
aVfor a small maneuverable flying object?
p529
aa(lp530
VRD: So I mean, in part,
p531
aVwe wondered if it was possible to do it.
p532
aVAnd you have to revisit these questions
p533
aVover time.
p534
aVThe folks at AeroVironment
p535
aVtried 300 or more different wing designs,
p536
aV12 different forms of the avionics.
p537
aVIt took them 10 full prototypes
p538
aVto get something that would actually fly.
p539
aVBut there's something really interesting
p540
aVabout a flying machine
p541
aVthat looks like something you'd recognize.
p542
aVSo we often talk about stealth
p543
aVas a means for avoiding any type of sensing,
p544
aVbut when things looks just natural,
p545
aVyou also don't see them.
p546
aa(lp547
VCA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.
p548
aVIt's partly the look. (RD: Sure.)
p549
aVIt's actually, "Look at that cute hummingbird
p550
aVflying into my headquarters."
p551
aV(Laughter)
p552
aVBecause I think, as well as the awe of looking at that,
p553
aVI'm sure some people here are thinking,
p554
aVtechnology catches up so quick,
p555
aVhow long is it
p556
aVbefore some crazed geek with a little remote control
p557
aVflies one through a window of the White House?
p558
aVI mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?
p559
aa(lp560
VRD: Well look, our singular mission
p561
aVis the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.
p562
aVThat's what we do.
p563
aVIt would be inconceivable
p564
aVfor us to do that work
p565
aVif we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do
p566
aVat the same time.
p567
aVIt's just the nature of what we do.
p568
aVNow our responsibility
p569
aVis to push that edge.
p570
aVAnd we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible
p571
aVof how the technology is developed
p572
aVand ultimately used,
p573
aVbut we can't simply close our eyes
p574
aVand pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.
p575
aa(lp576
VCA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.
p577
aVAnd you persuade people
p578
aVto go to these great feats of invention,
p579
aVbut at a personal level,
p580
aVin a way I can't imagine doing your job.
p581
aVDo you wake up in the night sometimes,
p582
aVjust asking questions
p583
aVabout the possibly unintended consequences
p584
aVof your team's brilliance?
p585
aa(lp586
VRD: Sure.
p587
aVI think you couldn't be human
p588
aVif you didn't ask those questions.
p589
aa(lp590
VCA: How do you answer them?
p591
aa(lp592
VRD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.
p593
aVI think that we learn
p594
aVas time goes on.
p595
aVMy job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.
p596
aVI work with some of the most amazing people.
p597
aVAnd with that exhilaration,
p598
aVcomes a really deep sense
p599
aVof responsibility.
p600
aVAnd so you have on the one hand
p601
aVthis tremendous lift
p602
aVof what's possible
p603
aVand this tremendous seriousness
p604
aVof what it means.
p605
aa(lp606
VCA: Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.
p607
aVThank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.)
