VWell, this is about state budgets.
p4
aVThis is probably the most boring topic
p5
aVof the whole morning.
p6
aVBut I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic
p7
aVthat we need to care about.
p8
aVState budgets
p9
aVare big, big money \u2014
p10
aVI'll show you the numbers \u2014
p11
aVand they get very little scrutiny.
p12
aVThe understanding is very low.
p13
aVMany of the people involved
p14
aVhave special interests or short-term interests
p15
aVthat get them not thinking
p16
aVabout what the implications of the trends are.
p17
aVAnd these budgets
p18
aVare the key for our future;
p19
aVthey're the key for our kids.
p20
aVMost education funding \u2014
p21
aVwhether it's K through 12,
p22
aVor the great universities or community colleges \u2014
p23
aVmost of the money for those things
p24
aVis coming out of these state budgets.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut we have a problem.
p27
aVHere's the overall picture.
p28
aVU.S. economy is big \u2014
p29
aV14.7 trillion.
p30
aVNow out of that pie,
p31
aVthe government spends 36 percent.
p32
aVSo this is combining the federal level,
p33
aVwhich is the largest,
p34
aVthe state level and the local level.
p35
aVAnd it's really in this combined way
p36
aVthat you get an overall sense of what's going on,
p37
aVbecause there's a lot of complex things
p38
aVlike Medicaid and research money
p39
aVthat flow across those boundaries.
p40
aVBut we're spending 36 percent.
p41
aVWell what are we taking in?
p42
aVSimple business question.
p43
aVAnswer is 26 percent.
p44
aVNow this leaves 10 percent deficit,
p45
aVsort of a mind-blowing number.
p46
aVAnd some of that, in fact, is due to the fact
p47
aVthat we've had an economic recession.
p48
aVReceipts go down,
p49
aVsome spending programs go up,
p50
aVbut most of it is not because of that.
p51
aVMost of it is because of ways
p52
aVthat the liabilities are building up
p53
aVand the trends,
p54
aVand that creates a huge challenge.
p55
aVIn fact, this is the forecast picture.
p56
aVThere are various things in here:
p57
aVI could say we might raise more revenue,
p58
aVor medical innovation will make the spending even higher.
p59
aVIt is an increasingly difficult picture,
p60
aVeven assuming the economy does quite well \u2014
p61
aVprobably better than it will do.
p62
aVThis is what you see
p63
aVat this overall level.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow how did we get here?
p66
aVHow could you have a problem like this?
p67
aVAfter all, at least on paper,
p68
aVthere's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.
p69
aVOnly one state says
p70
aVthey don't have to balance the budget.
p71
aVBut what this means actually
p72
aVis that there's a pretense.
p73
aVThere's no real, true balancing going on,
p74
aVand in a sense, the games they play to hide that
p75
aVactually obscure the topic so much
p76
aVthat people don't see things
p77
aVthat are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.
p78
aVWhen Jerry Brown was elected,
p79
aVthis was the challenge that was put to him.
p80
aVThat is, through various gimmicks and things,
p81
aVa so-called balanced budget
p82
aVhad led him to have 25 billion missing
p83
aVout of the 76 billion in proposed spending.
p84
aVNow he's put together some thoughts:
p85
aVAbout half of that he'll cut,
p86
aVanother half,
p87
aVperhaps in a very complex set of steps,
p88
aVtaxes will be approved.
p89
aVBut even so,
p90
aVas you go out into those future years,
p91
aVvarious pension costs, health costs go up enough,
p92
aVand the revenue does not go up enough.
p93
aVSo you get a big squeeze.
p94
aa(lp95
VWhat were those things that allowed us to hide this?
p96
aVWell, some really nice little tricks.
p97
aVAnd these were somewhat noticed.
p98
aVThe paper said, "It's not really balanced.
p99
aVIt's got holes.
p100
aVIt perpetuates deficit spending.
p101
aVIt's riddled with gimmicks."
p102
aVAnd really when you get down to it,
p103
aVthe guys at Enron never would have done this.
p104
aVThis is so blatant,
p105
aVso extreme.
p106
aVIs anyone paying attention
p107
aVto some of the things these guys do?
p108
aVThey borrow money.
p109
aVThey're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.
p110
aVThey make you pay more in withholding
p111
aVjust to help their cash flow out.
p112
aVThey sell off the assets.
p113
aVThey defer the payments.
p114
aVThey sell off the revenues from tobacco.
p115
aVAnd California's not unique.
p116
aVIn fact, there's about five states that are worse
p117
aVand only really four states
p118
aVthat don't face this big challenge.
p119
aVSo it's systemic across the entire country.
p120
aVIt really comes from the fact
p121
aVthat certain long-term obligations \u2014
p122
aVhealth care, where innovation makes it more expensive,
p123
aVearly retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,
p124
aVand just generosity \u2014
p125
aVthat these mis-accounting things
p126
aVallow to develop over time,
p127
aVthat you've got a problem.
p128
aVThis is the retiree health care benefits.
p129
aVThree million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability \u2014
p130
aVmuch worse than the car companies.
p131
aVAnd everybody looked at that
p132
aVand knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.
p133
aVThe forecast for the medical piece alone
p134
aVis to go from 26 percent of the budget
p135
aVto 42 percent.
p136
aa(lp137
VWell what's going to give?
p138
aVWell in order to accommodate that,
p139
aVyou would have to cut education spending in half.
p140
aVIt really is this young versus the old
p141
aVto some degree.
p142
aVIf you don't change that revenue picture,
p143
aVif you don't solve what you're doing in health care,
p144
aVyou're going to be deinvesting in the young.
p145
aVThe great University of California university system,
p146
aVthe great things that have gone on,
p147
aVwon't happen.
p148
aVSo far it's meant layoffs,
p149
aVincreased class sizes.
p150
aVWithin the education community there's this discussion of,
p151
aV"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,
p152
aVor the less good teachers who get laid off?"
p153
aVAnd there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,
p154
aVwhere do you do that? How much effect does that have?
p155
aVAnd unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,
p156
aVwell maybe you think that's okay.
p157
aVIn fact, no, education spending should not be cut.
p158
aVThere's ways, if it's temporary,
p159
aVto minimize the impact,
p160
aVbut it's a problem.
p161
aVIt's also really a problem for where we need to go.
p162
aVTechnology has a role to play.
p163
aVWell we need money to experiment with that,
p164
aVto get those tools in there.
p165
aVThere's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,
p166
aVmeasuring them, giving them feedback,
p167
aVtaking videos in the classroom.
p168
aVThat's something I think is very, very important.
p169
aVWell you have to allocate dollars
p170
aVfor that system
p171
aVand for that incentive pay.
p172
aVIn a situation where you have growth,
p173
aVyou put the new money into this.
p174
aVOr even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.
p175
aVBut with the type of cuts we're talking about,
p176
aVit will be far, far harder
p177
aVto get these incentives for excellence,
p178
aVor to move over
p179
aVto use technology in the new way.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo what's going on?
p182
aVWhere's the brain trust
p183
aVthat's in error here?
p184
aVWell there really is no brain trust.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVIt's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.
p187
aVJust look at this spending.
p188
aVCalifornia will spend over 100 billion,
p189
aVMicrosoft, 38,
p190
aVGoogle, about 19.
p191
aVThe amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,
p192
aVboth inside Google and Microsoft
p193
aVand outside, with analysts and people of various opinions \u2014
p194
aVshould they have spent on that?
p195
aVNo, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? \u2014
p196
aVit really is quite phenomenal.
p197
aVEverybody has an opinion.
p198
aVThere's great feedback.
p199
aVAnd the numbers are used to make decisions.
p200
aVIf you go over the education spending and the health care spending \u2014
p201
aVparticularly these long-term trends \u2014
p202
aVyou don't have that type of involvement
p203
aVon a number that's more important
p204
aVin terms of equity, in terms of learning.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo what do we need to do?
p207
aVWe need better tools.
p208
aVWe can get some things out on the Internet.
p209
aVI'm going to use my website
p210
aVto put up some things that will give the basic picture.
p211
aVWe need lots more.
p212
aVThere's a few good books,
p213
aVone about school spending and where the money comes from \u2014
p214
aVhow that's changed over time, and the challenge.
p215
aVWe need better accounting.
p216
aVWe need to take the fact
p217
aVthat the current employees, the future liabilities they create,
p218
aVthat should come out of the current budget.
p219
aVWe need to understand why they've done the pension accounting
p220
aVthe way they have.
p221
aVIt should be more like private accounting.
p222
aVIt's the gold standard.
p223
aVAnd finally, we need to really reward politicians.
p224
aVWhenever they say there's these long-term problems,
p225
aVwe can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?
p226
aVWe just shot you."
p227
aVIn fact, there are some like these:
p228
aVErskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,
p229
aVwho have gone through and given proposals
p230
aVfor this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.
p231
aVBut in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.
p232
aVIn fact, the week afterwards,
p233
aVsome tax cuts were done
p234
aVthat made the situation even worse
p235
aVthan their assumptions.
p236
aVSo we need these pieces.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow I think this is a solvable problem.
p239
aVIt's a great country with lots of people.
p240
aVBut we have to draw those people in,
p241
aVbecause this is about education.
p242
aVAnd just look at what happened with the tuitions
p243
aVwith the University of California
p244
aVand project that out for another three, four, five years \u2014
p245
aVit's unaffordable.
p246
aVAnd that's the kind of thing \u2014
p247
aVthe investment in the young \u2014
p248
aVthat makes us great, allows us to contribute.
p249
aVIt allows us to do the art,
p250
aVthe biotechnology, the software
p251
aVand all those magic things.
p252
aVAnd so the bottom line is
p253
aVwe need to care about state budgets
p254
aVbecause they're critical for our kids and our future.
