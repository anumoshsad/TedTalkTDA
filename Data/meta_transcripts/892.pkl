VIt's a great pleasure to be here.
p4
aVIt's a great pleasure to speak after
p5
aVBrian Cox from CERN.
p6
aVI think CERN is the home
p7
aVof the Large Hadron Collider.
p8
aVWhat ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?
p9
aVWhere is the Small Hadron Collider?
p10
aVBecause the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.
p11
aVNow, the Small Hadron Collider
p12
aVis in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.
p13
aVYou know when the Large Hadron Collider started,
p14
aVand it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,
p15
aVit was the Small Hadron Collider team
p16
aVwho sabotaged it
p17
aVbecause they were so jealous.
p18
aVThe whole Hadron Collider family
p19
aVneeds unlocking.
p20
aa(lp21
VThe lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way \u2014
p22
aVall those fantastic pictures \u2014
p23
aVis this really:
p24
aVthat vantage point determines everything that you see.
p25
aVWhat Brian was saying was
p26
aVscience has opened up successively different vantage points
p27
aVfrom which we can see ourselves,
p28
aVand that's why it's so valuable.
p29
aVSo the vantage point you take
p30
aVdetermines virtually everything that you will see.
p31
aVThe question that you will ask
p32
aVwill determine much of the answer that you get.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd so if you ask this question:
p35
aVWhere would you look to see the future of education?
p36
aVThe answer that we've traditionally given to that
p37
aVis very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:
p38
aVYou go to Finland.
p39
aVFinland is the best place in the world to see school systems.
p40
aVThe Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,
p41
aVbut by golly, they are qualified.
p42
aVAnd they have absolutely amazing education systems.
p43
aVSo we all troop off to Finland,
p44
aVand we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland
p45
aVand its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,
p46
aVand then we struggle to imagine how we might
p47
aVbring lessons back.
p48
aa(lp49
VWell, so, for this last year,
p50
aVwith the help of Cisco who sponsored me,
p51
aVfor some balmy reason, to do this,
p52
aVI've been looking somewhere else.
p53
aVBecause actually radical innovation does sometimes
p54
aVcome from the very best,
p55
aVbut it often comes from places
p56
aVwhere you have huge need \u2014
p57
aVunmet, latent demand \u2014
p58
aVand not enough resources for traditional solutions to work \u2014
p59
aVtraditional, high-cost solutions,
p60
aVwhich depend on professionals,
p61
aVwhich is what schools and hospitals are.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I ended up in places like this.
p64
aVThis is a place called Monkey Hill.
p65
aVIt's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.
p66
aVMost of the population growth of the next 50 years
p67
aVwill be in cities.
p68
aVWe'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year
p69
aVfor the next 30 years.
p70
aVAlmost all of that growth will be in the developed world.
p71
aVAlmost all of that growth will be
p72
aVin places like Monkey Hill.
p73
aVThis is where you'll find the fastest growing
p74
aVyoung populations of the world.
p75
aVSo if you want recipes to work \u2014
p76
aVfor virtually anything \u2014 health, education,
p77
aVgovernment politics
p78
aVand education \u2014
p79
aVyou have to go to these places.
p80
aVAnd if you go to these places, you meet people like this.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis is a guy called Juanderson.
p83
aVAt the age of 14,
p84
aVin common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,
p85
aVhe dropped out of school.
p86
aVIt was boring.
p87
aVAnd Juanderson, instead, went into
p88
aVwhat provided kind of opportunity and hope
p89
aVin the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.
p90
aVAnd by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,
p91
aVhe was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.
p92
aVHe was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.
p93
aVHe employed 200 people.
p94
aVHe was going to be dead by the age of 25.
p95
aVAnd luckily, he met this guy,
p96
aVwho is Rodrigo Baggio,
p97
aVthe owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.
p98
aV1994, Rodrigo started something
p99
aVcalled CDI,
p100
aVwhich took computers
p101
aVdonated by corporations,
p102
aVput them into community centers in favelas
p103
aVand created places like this.
p104
aVWhat turned Juanderson around
p105
aVwas technology for learning
p106
aVthat made learning fun and accessible.
p107
aa(lp108
VOr you can go to places like this.
p109
aVThis is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.
p110
aVMillions of people living here,
p111
aVstretched over many kilometers.
p112
aVAnd there I met these two,
p113
aVAzra on the left, Maureen on the right.
p114
aVThey just finished their Kenyan certificate
p115
aVof secondary education.
p116
aVThat name should tell you that the Kenyan education system
p117
aVborrows almost everything
p118
aVfrom Britain, circa 1950,
p119
aVbut has managed to make it even worse.
p120
aVSo there are schools in slums like this.
p121
aVThey're places like this.
p122
aVThat's where Maureen went to school.
p123
aVThey're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.
p124
aVAnd the education they got was pitiful.
p125
aVIt was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns
p126
aVin another slum called Nakuru.
p127
aVHalf the children in this classroom have no parents
p128
aVbecause they've died through AIDS.
p129
aVThe other half have one parent
p130
aVbecause the other parent has died through AIDS.
p131
aVSo the challenges of education
p132
aVin this kind of place
p133
aVare not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.
p134
aVThey are to stay alive, to earn a living,
p135
aVto not become HIV positive.
p136
aVThe one technology that spans rich and poor
p137
aVin places like this
p138
aVis not anything to do with industrial technology.
p139
aVIt's not to do with electricity or water.
p140
aVIt's the mobile phone.
p141
aVIf you want to design from scratch
p142
aVvirtually any service in Africa,
p143
aVyou would start now with the mobile phone.
p144
aVOr you could go to places like this.
p145
aa(lp146
VThis is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,
p147
aVwhich is a very developed slum
p148
aVabout 25 minutes outside New Delhi,
p149
aVwhere I met these characters
p150
aVwho showed me around for the day.
p151
aVThe remarkable thing about these girls,
p152
aVand the sign of the kind of social revolution
p153
aVsweeping through the developing world
p154
aVis that these girls are not married.
p155
aVTen years ago, they certainly would have been married.
p156
aVNow they're not married, and they want to go on
p157
aVto study further, to have a career.
p158
aVThey've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,
p159
aVwho have never ever done homework.
p160
aVAll across the developing world there are millions of parents \u2014
p161
aVtens, hundreds of millions \u2014
p162
aVwho for the first time
p163
aVare with children doing homework and exams.
p164
aVAnd the reason they carry on studying
p165
aVis not because they went to a school like this.
p166
aVThis is a private school.
p167
aVThis is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.
p168
aVThis is the best you can get
p169
aVin Hyderabad in Indian education.
p170
aVThe reason they went on studying was this.
p171
aa(lp172
VThis is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum
p173
aVby a revolutionary social entrepreneur
p174
aVcalled Sugata Mitra
p175
aVwho has conducted the most radical experiments,
p176
aVshowing that children, in the right conditions,
p177
aVcan learn on their own with the help of computers.
p178
aVThose girls have never touched Google.
p179
aVThey know nothing about Wikipedia.
p180
aVImagine what their lives would be like
p181
aVif you could get that to them.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo if you look, as I did,
p184
aVthrough this tour,
p185
aVand by looking at about a hundred case studies
p186
aVof different social entrepreneurs
p187
aVworking in these very extreme conditions,
p188
aVlook at the recipes that they come up with for learning,
p189
aVthey look nothing like school.
p190
aVWhat do they look like?
p191
aVWell, education is a global religion.
p192
aVAnd education, plus technology,
p193
aVis a great source of hope.
p194
aVYou can go to places like this.
p195
aa(lp196
VThis is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.
p197
aVMost of the children there have parents who are illiterate.
p198
aVMany of them don't have electricity at home.
p199
aVBut they find it completely obvious
p200
aVto use computers, websites,
p201
aVmake videos, so on and so forth.
p202
aVWhen you go to places like this
p203
aVwhat you see is that
p204
aVeducation in these settings
p205
aVworks by pull, not push.
p206
aVMost of our education system is push.
p207
aVI was literally pushed to school.
p208
aVWhen you get to school, things are pushed at you:
p209
aVknowledge, exams,
p210
aVsystems, timetables.
p211
aVIf you want to attract people like Juanderson
p212
aVwho could, for instance,
p213
aVbuy guns, wear jewelry,
p214
aVride motorbikes and get girls
p215
aVthrough the drugs trade,
p216
aVand you want to attract him into education,
p217
aVhaving a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.
p218
aVThat isn't really going to attract him.
p219
aVYou need to pull him.
p220
aVAnd so education needs to work by pull, not push.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd so the idea of a curriculum
p223
aVis completely irrelevant in a setting like this.
p224
aVYou need to start education
p225
aVfrom things that make a difference
p226
aVto them in their settings.
p227
aVWhat does that?
p228
aVWell, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.
p229
aVOne is to deliver extrinsic motivation,
p230
aVthat education has a payoff.
p231
aVOur education systems all work
p232
aVon the principle that there is a payoff,
p233
aVbut you have to wait quite a long time.
p234
aVThat's too long if you're poor.
p235
aVWaiting 10 years for the payoff from education
p236
aVis too long when you need to meet daily needs,
p237
aVwhen you've got siblings to look after
p238
aVor a business to help with.
p239
aVSo you need education to be relevant and help people
p240
aVto make a living there and then, often.
p241
aVAnd you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo time and again, I found people like this.
p244
aVThis is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,
p245
aVin Belo Horizonte,
p246
aVin the third largest city in Brazil.
p247
aVHe's invented more than 200 games
p248
aVto teach virtually any subject under the sun.
p249
aVIn the schools and communities
p250
aVthat Taio works in,
p251
aVthe day always starts in a circle
p252
aVand always starts from a question.
p253
aVImagine an education system that started from questions,
p254
aVnot from knowledge to be imparted,
p255
aVor started from a game, not from a lesson,
p256
aVor started from the premise
p257
aVthat you have to engage people first
p258
aVbefore you can possibly teach them.
p259
aVOur education systems,
p260
aVyou do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,
p261
aVsport, drama, music.
p262
aVThese things, they teach through.
p263
aVThey attract people to learning
p264
aVbecause it's really a dance project
p265
aVor a circus project
p266
aVor, the best example of all \u2014
p267
aVEl Sistema in Venezuela \u2014
p268
aVit's a music project.
p269
aVAnd so you attract people through that into learning,
p270
aVnot adding that on after
p271
aVall the learning has been done
p272
aVand you've eaten your cognitive greens.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo El Sistema in Venezuela
p275
aVuses a violin as a technology of learning.
p276
aVTaio Rocha uses making soap
p277
aVas a technology of learning.
p278
aVAnd what you find when you go to these schemes
p279
aVis that they use people and places
p280
aVin incredibly creative ways.
p281
aVMasses of peer learning.
p282
aVHow do you get learning to people
p283
aVwhen there are no teachers,
p284
aVwhen teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,
p285
aVand even if you do get teachers,
p286
aVwhat they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?
p287
aVWell, you create your own teachers.
p288
aVYou create peer-to-peer learning,
p289
aVor you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.
p290
aVBut you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people
p291
aVthrough technology, people and places that are different.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo this is a school in a bus
p294
aVon a building site
p295
aVin Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.
p296
aVPune has 5,000 building sites.
p297
aVIt has 30,000 children
p298
aVon those building sites.
p299
aVThat's one city.
p300
aVImagine that urban explosion
p301
aVthat's going to take place across the developing world
p302
aVand how many thousands of children
p303
aVwill spend their school years on building sites.
p304
aVWell, this is a very simple scheme
p305
aVto get the learning to them through a bus.
p306
aVAnd they all treat learning,
p307
aVnot as some sort of academic, analytical activity,
p308
aVbut as that's something that's productive,
p309
aVsomething you make,
p310
aVsomething that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo I met this character, Steven.
p313
aVHe'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets
p314
aVbecause his parents had died of AIDS.
p315
aVAnd he was finally brought back into school,
p316
aVnot by the offer of GCSEs,
p317
aVbut by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,
p318
aVa practical making skill.
p319
aVSo the trendiest schools in the world,
p320
aVHigh Tech High and others,
p321
aVthey espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.
p322
aVHere, there isn't really an option.
p323
aVLearning has to be productive
p324
aVin order for it to make sense.
p325
aa(lp326
VAnd finally, they have a different model of scale,
p327
aVand it's a Chinese restaurant model
p328
aVof how to scale.
p329
aVAnd I learned it from this guy,
p330
aVwho is an amazing character.
p331
aVHe's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur
p332
aVin education in the world.
p333
aVHis name is Madhav Chavan,
p334
aVand he created something called Pratham.
p335
aVAnd Pratham runs preschool play groups
p336
aVfor, now, 21 million children in India.
p337
aVIt's the largest NGO in education in the world.
p338
aVAnd it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.
p339
aVHe's a complete revolutionary.
p340
aVHe's actually a trade union organizer by background,
p341
aVand that's how he learned the skills
p342
aVto build his organization.
p343
aa(lp344
VWhen they got to a certain stage,
p345
aVPratham got big enough to attract
p346
aVsome pro bono support from McKinsey.
p347
aVMcKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,
p348
aV"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?
p349
aVYou should turn it into McDonald's.
p350
aVAnd what you do when you go to any new site
p351
aVis you kind of roll out a franchise.
p352
aVAnd it's the same wherever you go.
p353
aVIt's reliable and people know exactly where they are.
p354
aVAnd there will be no mistakes."
p355
aVAnd Madhav said,
p356
aV"Why do we have to do it that way?
p357
aVWhy can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"
p358
aa(lp359
VThere are Chinese restaurants everywhere,
p360
aVbut there is no Chinese restaurant chain.
p361
aVYet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.
p362
aVThey know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different
p363
aVand the colors will be different and the name will be different.
p364
aVYou know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.
p365
aVThese people work with the Chinese restaurant model \u2014
p366
aVsame principles, different applications and different settings \u2014
p367
aVnot the McDonald's model.
p368
aVThe McDonald's model scales.
p369
aVThe Chinese restaurant model spreads.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo mass education
p372
aVstarted with social entrepreneurship
p373
aVin the 19th century.
p374
aVAnd that's desperately what we need again
p375
aVon a global scale.
p376
aVAnd what can we learn from all of that?
p377
aVWell, we can learn a lot
p378
aVbecause our education systems
p379
aVare failing desperately in many ways.
p380
aVThey fail to reach the people
p381
aVthey most need to serve.
p382
aVThey often hit their target but miss the point.
p383
aVImprovement is increasingly
p384
aVdifficult to organize;
p385
aVour faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.
p386
aVAnd this is just a very simple way of
p387
aVunderstanding what kind of innovation,
p388
aVwhat kind of different design we need.
p389
aa(lp390
VThere are two basic types of innovation.
p391
aVThere's sustaining innovation,
p392
aVwhich will sustain an existing institution or an organization,
p393
aVand disruptive innovation
p394
aVthat will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.
p395
aVThere are formal settings \u2014
p396
aVschools, colleges, hospitals \u2014
p397
aVin which innovation can take place,
p398
aVand informal settings \u2014 communities,
p399
aVfamilies, social networks.
p400
aVAlmost all our effort goes in this box,
p401
aVsustaining innovation in formal settings,
p402
aVgetting a better version
p403
aVof the essentially Bismarckian school system
p404
aVthat developed in the 19th century.
p405
aVAnd as I said, the trouble with this is that,
p406
aVin the developing world
p407
aVthere just aren't teachers to make this model work.
p408
aVYou'd need millions and millions of teachers
p409
aVin China, India, Nigeria
p410
aVand the rest of developing world to meet need.
p411
aVAnd in our system, we know
p412
aVthat simply doing more of this won't eat into
p413
aVdeep educational inequalities,
p414
aVespecially in inner cities
p415
aVand former industrial areas.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.
p418
aVWe need more reinvention.
p419
aVAnd all around the world now you see
p420
aVmore and more schools reinventing themselves.
p421
aVThey're recognizably schools, but they look different.
p422
aVThere are Big Picture schools
p423
aVin the U.S. and Australia.
p424
aVThere are Kunskapsskolan schools
p425
aVin Sweden.
p426
aVOf 14 of them,
p427
aVonly two of them are in schools.
p428
aVMost of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.
p429
aVThere is an amazing school in Northen Queensland
p430
aVcalled Jaringan.
p431
aVAnd they all have the same kind of features:
p432
aVhighly collaborative, very personalized,
p433
aVoften pervasive technology,
p434
aVlearning that starts from questions
p435
aVand problems and projects,
p436
aVnot from knowledge and curriculum.
p437
aVSo we certainly need more of that.
p438
aa(lp439
VBut because so many of the issues in education
p440
aVaren't just in school,
p441
aVthey're in family and community,
p442
aVwhat you also need, definitely,
p443
aVis more on the right hand side.
p444
aVYou need efforts to supplement schools.
p445
aVThe most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,
p446
aVthe family-based learning system
p447
aVto support and encourage people in schools.
p448
aVThe most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,
p449
aVwhich over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,
p450
aVhas, through a mixture of schooling
p451
aVand family and community projects,
p452
aVattempted to transform not just education in schools,
p453
aVbut the entire culture and aspiration
p454
aVof about 10,000 families in Harlem.
p455
aVWe need more of that
p456
aVcompletely new and radical thinking.
p457
aVYou can go to places an hour away, less,
p458
aVfrom this room,
p459
aVjust down the road, which need that,
p460
aVwhich need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.
p461
aa(lp462
VAnd finally, you need transformational innovation
p463
aVthat could imagine getting learning to people
p464
aVin completely new and different ways.
p465
aVSo we are on the verge, 2015,
p466
aVof an amazing achievement,
p467
aVthe schoolification of the world.
p468
aVEvery child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school
p469
aVwill be able to have one in 2015.
p470
aVIt's an amazing thing.
p471
aVBut it is,
p472
