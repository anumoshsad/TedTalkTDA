VWhen I was first learning to meditate,
p4
aVthe instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath,
p5
aVand when my mind wandered, to bring it back.
p6
aa(lp7
VSounded simple enough.
p8
aVYet I'd sit on these silent retreats,
p9
aVsweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.
p10
aVI'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.
p11
aVActually, it was exhausting.
p12
aVThe instruction was simple enough
p13
aVbut I was missing something really important.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo why is it so hard to pay attention?
p16
aVWell, studies show
p17
aVthat even when we're really trying to pay attention to something \u2014
p18
aVlike maybe this talk \u2014
p19
aVat some point,
p20
aVabout half of us will drift off into a daydream,
p21
aVor have this urge to check our Twitter feed.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo what's going on here?
p24
aVIt turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved
p25
aVlearning processes currently known in science,
p26
aVone that's conserved
p27
aVback to the most basic nervous systems known to man.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis reward-based learning process
p30
aVis called positive and negative reinforcement,
p31
aVand basically goes like this.
p32
aVWe see some food that looks good,
p33
aVour brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"
p34
aVWe eat the food, we taste it \u2014
p35
aVit tastes good.
p36
aVAnd especially with sugar,
p37
aVour bodies send a signal to our brain that says,
p38
aV"Remember what you're eating and where you found it."
p39
aVWe lay down this context-dependent memory
p40
aVand learn to repeat the process next time.
p41
aVSee food,
p42
aVeat food, feel good,
p43
aVrepeat.
p44
aVTrigger, behavior, reward.
p45
aa(lp46
VSimple, right?
p47
aVWell, after a while, our creative brains say,
p48
aV"You know what?
p49
aVYou can use this for more than just remembering where food is.
p50
aVYou know, next time you feel bad,
p51
aVwhy don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"
p52
aVWe thank our brains for the great idea,
p53
aVtry this and quickly learn
p54
aVthat if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad,
p55
aVwe feel better.
p56
aa(lp57
VSame process,
p58
aVjust a different trigger.
p59
aVInstead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,
p60
aVthis emotional signal \u2014 feeling sad \u2014
p61
aVtriggers that urge to eat.
p62
aa(lp63
VMaybe in our teenage years,
p64
aVwe were a nerd at school,
p65
aVand we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think,
p66
aV"Hey, I want to be cool."
p67
aVSo we start smoking.
p68
aVThe Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.
p69
aVSee cool,
p70
aVsmoke to be cool,
p71
aVfeel good. Repeat.
p72
aVTrigger, behavior, reward.
p73
aVAnd each time we do this,
p74
aVwe learn to repeat the process
p75
aVand it becomes a habit.
p76
aVSo later,
p77
aVfeeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette
p78
aVor to eat something sweet.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, with these same brain processes,
p81
aVwe've gone from learning to survive
p82
aVto literally killing ourselves with these habits.
p83
aVObesity and smoking
p84
aVare among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo back to my breath.
p87
aVWhat if instead of fighting our brains,
p88
aVor trying to force ourselves to pay attention,
p89
aVwe instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...
p90
aVbut added a twist?
p91
aVWhat if instead we just got really curious
p92
aVabout what was happening in our momentary experience?
p93
aa(lp94
VI'll give you an example.
p95
aVIn my lab,
p96
aVwe studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.
p97
aVNow, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath,
p98
aVthey could try to force themselves to quit smoking.
p99
aVAnd the majority of them had tried this before and failed \u2014
p100
aVon average, six times.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, with mindfulness training,
p103
aVwe dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.
p104
aVIn fact, we even told them to smoke.
p105
aVWhat? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,
p106
aVjust be really curious about what it's like when you do."
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd what did they notice?
p109
aVWell here's an example from one of our smokers.
p110
aVShe said, "Mindful smoking:
p111
aVsmells like stinky cheese
p112
aVand tastes like chemicals,
p113
aVYUCK!"
p114
aVNow, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her,
p115
aVthat's why she joined our program.
p116
aVWhat she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked
p117
aVwas that smoking tastes like shit.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
p122
aVShe moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her
p123
aVto knowing it in her bones,
p124
aVand the spell of smoking was broken.
p125
aVShe started to become disenchanted with her behavior.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, the prefrontal cortex,
p128
aVthat youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,
p129
aVit understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.
p130
aVAnd it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior,
p131
aVto help us stop smoking,
p132
aVto help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.
p133
aVWe call this cognitive control.
p134
aVWe're using cognition to control our behavior.
p135
aVUnfortunately,
p136
aVthis is also the first part of our brain
p137
aVthat goes offline when we get stressed out,
p138
aVwhich isn't that helpful.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, we can all relate to this in our own experience.
p141
aVWe're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids
p142
aVwhen we're stressed out or tired,
p143
aVeven though we know it's not going to be helpful.
p144
aVWe just can't help ourselves.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhen the prefrontal cortex goes offline,
p147
aVwe fall back into our old habits,
p148
aVwhich is why this disenchantment is so important.
p149
aVSeeing what we get from our habits
p150
aVhelps us understand them at a deeper level \u2014
p151
aVto know it in our bones
p152
aVso we don't have to force ourselves to hold back
p153
aVor restrain ourselves from behavior.
p154
aVWe're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd this is what mindfulness is all about:
p157
aVSeeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors,
p158
aVbecoming disenchanted on a visceral level
p159
aVand from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.
p160
aa(lp161
VThis isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.
p162
aVBut over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly
p163
aVthe results of our actions,
p164
aVwe let go of old habits and form new ones.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe paradox here
p167
aVis that mindfulness is just about being really interested
p168
aVin getting close and personal
p169
aVwith what's actually happening in our bodies and minds
p170
aVfrom moment to moment.
p171
aVThis willingness to turn toward our experience
p172
aVrather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.
p173
aVAnd this willingness to turn toward our experience
p174
aVis supported by curiosity,
p175
aVwhich is naturally rewarding.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat does curiosity feel like?
p178
aVIt feels good.
p179
aVAnd what happens when we get curious?
p180
aVWe start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations \u2014
p181
aVoh, there's tightness, there's tension,
p182
aVthere's restlessness \u2014
p183
aVand that these body sensations come and go.
p184
aVThese are bite-size pieces of experiences
p185
aVthat we can manage from moment to moment
p186
aVrather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving
p187
aVthat we choke on.
p188
aa(lp189
VIn other words, when we get curious,
p190
aVwe step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns,
p191
aVand we step into being.
p192
aVWe become this inner scientist
p193
aVwhere we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.
p196
aVBut in one study, we found that mindfulness training
p197
aVwas twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
p198
aVSo it actually works.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd when we studied the brains of experienced meditators,
p201
aVwe found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing
p202
aVcalled the default mode network
p203
aVwere at play.
p204
aVNow, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network,
p205
aVcalled the posterior cingulate cortex,
p206
aVis activated not necessarily by craving itself
p207
aVbut when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in,
p208
aVand it takes us for a ride.
p209
aa(lp210
VIn contrast, when we let go \u2014
p211
aVstep out of the process
p212
aVjust by being curiously aware of what's happening \u2014
p213
aVthis same brain region quiets down.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs
p216
aVthat target these core mechanisms
p217
aVand, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction
p218
aVto help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns
p219
aVof smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?
p222
aVWe can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips
p223
aVin the contexts that matter most.
p224
aVSo we can help them
p225
aVtap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware
p226
aVright when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo if you don't smoke or stress eat,
p229
aVmaybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored,
p230
aVor you're trying to distract yourself from work,
p231
aVor maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving,
p232
aVsee if you can tap into this natural capacity,
p233
aVjust be curiously aware
p234
aVof what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.
p235
aVIt will just be another chance
p236
aVto perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...
p237
aVor step out of it.
p238
aa(lp239
VInstead of see text message, compulsively text back,
p240
aVfeel a little bit better \u2014
p241
aVnotice the urge,
p242
aVget curious,
p243
aVfeel the joy of letting go
p244
aVand repeat.
p245
aa(lp246
VThank you.
