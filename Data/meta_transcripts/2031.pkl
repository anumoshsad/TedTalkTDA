VI don't know if you've noticed,
p4
aVbut there's been a spate of books
p5
aVthat have come out lately
p6
aVcontemplating or speculating
p7
aVon the cognition and emotional life of dogs.
p8
aVDo they think, do they feel and, if so, how?
p9
aVSo this afternoon, in my limited time,
p10
aVI wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that
p11
aVby introducing you to two dogs,
p12
aVboth of whom have taken the command "speak"
p13
aVquite literally.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe first dog is the first to go,
p16
aVand he is contemplating an aspect
p17
aVof his relationship to his owner,
p18
aVand the title is "A Dog on His Master."
p19
aa(lp20
V"As young as I look,
p21
aVI am growing older faster than he.
p22
aVSeven to one is the ratio, they tend to say.
p23
aVWhatever the number, I will pass him one day
p24
aVand take the lead,
p25
aVthe way I do on our walks in the woods,
p26
aVand if this ever manages to cross his mind,
p27
aVit would be the sweetest shadow
p28
aVI have ever cast on snow or grass."

p31
aa(lp32
VThank you.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd our next dog
p35
aVspeaks in something called the revenant,
p36
aVwhich means a spirit that comes back
p37
aVto visit you.
p38
aa(lp39
V"I am the dog you put to sleep,
p40
aVas you like to call the needle of oblivion,
p41
aVcome back to tell you this simple thing:
p42
aVI never liked you."
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aV"When I licked your face,
p45
aVI thought of biting off your nose.
p46
aVWhen I watched you toweling yourself dry,
p47
aVI wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.
p48
aVI resented the way you moved,
p49
aVyour lack of animal grace,
p50
aVthe way you would sit in a chair to eat,
p51
aVa napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.
p52
aVI would have run away
p53
aVbut I was too weak,
p54
aVa trick you taught me
p55
aVwhile I was learning to sit and heel
p56
aVand, greatest of insults,
p57
aVshake hands without a hand.
p58
aVI admit the sight of the leash would excite me,
p59
aVbut only because it meant I was about to smell things
p60
aVyou had never touched.
p61
aVYou do not want to believe this,
p62
aVbut I have no reason to lie:
p63
aVI hated the car, hated the rubber toys,
p64
aVdisliked your friends, and worse, your relatives.
p65
aVThe jingling of my tags drove me mad.
p66
aVYou always scratched me in the wrong place."
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aV"All I ever wanted from you was food and water
p69
aVin my bowls.
p70
aVWhile you slept, I watched you breathe
p71
aVas the moon rose in the sky.
p72
aVIt took all of my strength
p73
aVnot to raise my head and howl.
p74
aVNow, I am free of the collar,
p75
aVfree of the yellow raincoat,
p76
aVmonogrammed sweater,
p77
aVthe absurdity of your lawn,
p78
aVand that is all you need to know about this place,
p79
aVexcept what you already supposed
p80
aVand are glad it did not happen sooner,
p81
aVthat everyone here can read and write,
p82
aVthe dogs in poetry,
p83
aVthe cats and all the others
p84
aVin prose."
p85
aa(lp86
VThank you.
