VThe kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do
p4
aVis almost like the weatherman.
p5
aVWe are always chasing storms.
p6
aVWe want to see and measure storms \u2014 brainstorms, that is.
p7
aVAnd we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,
p8
aVbut we rarely see or listen to one.
p9
aVSo I always like to start these talks
p10
aVby actually introducing you to one of them.
p11
aa(lp12
VActually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron \u2014
p13
aVa hundred brain cells simultaneously \u2014
p14
aVwe could measure the electrical sparks
p15
aVof a hundred cells in the same animal,
p16
aVthis is the first image we got,
p17
aVthe first 10 seconds of this recording.
p18
aVSo we got a little snippet of a thought,
p19
aVand we could see it in front of us.
p20
aa(lp21
VI always tell the students
p22
aVthat we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer,
p23
aVbecause we are dealing with a system
p24
aVthat is only comparable in terms of number of cells
p25
aVto the number of galaxies that we have in the universe.
p26
aVAnd here we are, out of billions of neurons,
p27
aVjust recording, 10 years ago, a hundred.
p28
aVWe are doing a thousand now.
p29
aVAnd we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature.
p30
aVBecause, if you don't know yet,
p31
aVeverything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms,
p32
aVcomes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains
p33
aVand define our memories, our beliefs,
p34
aVour feelings, our plans for the future.
p35
aVEverything that we ever do,
p36
aVeverything that every human has ever done, do or will do,
p37
aVrequires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd the sound of a brainstorm, if you've never heard one,
p40
aVis somewhat like this.
p41
aVYou can put it louder if you can.
p42
aVMy son calls this "making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."
p43
aVThis is a brain.
p44
aVThis is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker
p45
aVand you listen to a hundred brain cells firing,
p46
aVyour brain will sound like this \u2014 my brain, any brain.
p47
aVAnd what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time
p48
aVis to actually listen to these symphonies, these brain symphonies,
p49
aVand try to extract from them the messages they carry.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn particular, about 12 years ago
p52
aVwe created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces.
p53
aVAnd you have a scheme here that describes how it works.
p54
aVThe idea is, let's have some sensors that listen to these storms, this electrical firing,
p55
aVand see if you can, in the same time that it takes
p56
aVfor this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal \u2014
p57
aVabout half a second \u2014
p58
aVlet's see if we can read these signals,
p59
aVextract the motor messages that are embedded in it,
p60
aVtranslate it into digital commands
p61
aVand send it to an artificial device
p62
aVthat will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time.
p63
aVAnd see if we can measure how well we can translate that message
p64
aVwhen we compare to the way the body does that.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd if we can actually provide feedback,
p67
aVsensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator
p68
aVthat is now under the control of the brain,
p69
aVback to the brain,
p70
aVhow the brain deals with that,
p71
aVof receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
p74
aVWe started with a superstar monkey called Aurora
p75
aVthat became one of the superstars of this field.
p76
aVAnd Aurora liked to play video games.
p77
aVAs you can see here,
p78
aVshe likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.
p79
aVAnd as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.
p80
aVSo even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross
p81
aVwith the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick,
p82
aVAurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.
p83
aVAnd if she's doing that,
p84
aVbecause every time she crosses that target with the little cursor,
p85
aVshe gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice.
p86
aVAnd I can tell you, any monkey will do anything for you
p87
aVif you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice.
p88
aVActually any primate will do that.
p89
aVThink about that.
p90
aa(lp91
VWell, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw,
p92
aVand doing a thousand trials a day
p93
aVand getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice,
p94
aVwe are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head
p95
aVand sending them to a robotic arm
p96
aVthat was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making.
p97
aVBecause the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface
p98
aVand have Aurora play the game just by thinking,
p99
aVwithout interference of her body.
p100
aVHer brainstorms would control an arm
p101
aVthat would move the cursor and cross the target.
p102
aVAnd to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.
p103
aVShe played the game without moving her body.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo every trajectory that you see of the cursor now,
p106
aVthis is the exact first moment she got that.
p107
aVThat's the exact first moment
p108
aVa brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate
p109
aVand could act outside, in that outside world,
p110
aVjust by controlling an artificial device.
p111
aVAnd Aurora kept playing the game, kept finding the little target
p112
aVand getting the orange juice that she wanted to get, that she craved for.
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.
p115
aVThe robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later,
p116
aVafter the first video that I showed to you,
p117
aVis under the control of Aurora's brain
p118
aVand is moving the cursor to get to the target.
p119
aVAnd Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm,
p120
aVbut she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases.
p121
aVShe can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game.
p122
aVBy all purposes and means,
p123
aVAurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device
p124
aVas an extension of her body.
p125
aVThe model of the self that Aurora had in her mind
p126
aVhas been expanded to get one more arm.
p127
aa(lp128
VWell, we did that 10 years ago.
p129
aVJust fast forward 10 years.
p130
aVJust last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device.
p131
aVYou can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.
p132
aVAnd you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them,
p133
aVor you can train them to assume in a virtual world
p134
aVthe first-person perspective of that avatar
p135
aVand use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd what we did basically was to train the animals
p138
aVto learn how to control these avatars
p139
aVand explore objects that appear in the virtual world.
p140
aVAnd these objects are visually identical,
p141
aVbut when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects,
p142
aVthey send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object
p143
aVthat goes back directly to the monkey's brain,
p144
aVinforming the brain what it is the avatar is touching.
p145
aVAnd in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation
p146
aVand acquires a new sensory pathway \u2014 like a new sense.
p147
aVAnd you truly liberate the brain now
p148
aVbecause you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.
p149
aVAnd the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain
p150
aVwithout the interference of the skin.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo what you see here is this is the design of the task.
p153
aVYou're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets.
p154
aVAnd he has to select one because only one carries the reward,
p155
aVthe orange juice that they want to get.
p156
aVAnd he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist.
p157
aVAnd that's exactly what they do.
p158
aa(lp159
VThis is a complete liberation of the brain
p160
aVfrom the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task.
p161
aVThe animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets.
p162
aVAnd he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain.
p163
aVAnd the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.
p164
aVThe legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey.
p165
aVAnd by the way, they don't read English anyway,
p166
aVso they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position.
p167
aVAnd yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination,
p168
aVand they can press it and select it.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo when we look at the brains of these animals,
p171
aVon the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells
p172
aVshowing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms,
p173
aVof this sample of neurons in the brain
p174
aVwhen the animal is using a joystick.
p175
aVAnd that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows.
p176
aVThe basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions.
p177
aVThe bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving
p178
aVand the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar.
p179
aVAs fast as we can reset our computers,
p180
aVthe brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool,
p181
aVas if this too was a part of that primate's body.
p182
aVThe brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo that suggests to us that our sense of self
p185
aVdoes not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies,
p186
aVbut it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.
p187
aVOur violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing \u2014
p188
aVthey all become assimilated by this voracious, amazing, dynamic system called the brain.
p189
aa(lp190
VHow far can we take it?
p191
aVWell, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit.
p192
aVWe had an animal running on a treadmill
p193
aVat Duke University on the East Coast of the United States,
p194
aVproducing the brainstorms necessary to move.
p195
aVAnd we had a robotic device, a humanoid robot,
p196
aVin Kyoto, Japan at ATR Laboratories
p197
aVthat was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain,
p198
aVa human brain, or a primate brain.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey
p201
aVwas transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk
p202
aVwhile footage of this walking was sent back to Duke,
p203
aVso that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.
p204
aVSo she could be rewarded, not by what her body was doing
p205
aVbut for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet
p206
aVcontrolled by her brain activity.
p207
aa(lp208
VFunny thing, that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less
p209
aVthan it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head, the head of the monkey,
p210
aVand reach its own muscle.
p211
aVThe monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger, across the planet.
p212
aVThis is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.
p213
aVThis is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan
p214
aVunder the control of the brain activity of a primate.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo where are we taking all this?
p217
aVWhat are we going to do with all this research,
p218
aVbesides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears?
p219
aVWell the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology
p220
aVand try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world.
p221
aVMillions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms
p222
aVinto action, into movement.
p223
aVAlthough their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements,
p224
aVthey cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo our idea is to create a bypass,
p227
aVis to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals,
p228
aVlarger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again,
p229
aVbypass the lesion using computational microengineering
p230
aVand send it to a new body, a whole body called an exoskeleton,
p231
aVa whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd you can see an image produced by this consortium.
p234
aVThis is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project
p235
aVthat is putting together scientists from Europe,
p236
aVfrom here in the United States, and in Brazil
p237
aVtogether to work to actually get this new body built \u2014
p238
aVa body that we believe, through the same plastic mechanisms
p239
aVthat allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface
p240
aVand that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life.
p241
aVThis same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients,
p242
aVnot only to imagine again the movements that they want to make
p243
aVand translate them into movements of this new body,
p244
aVbut for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo I was told about 10 years ago
p247
aVthat this would never happen, that this was close to impossible.
p248
aVAnd I can only tell you that as a scientist,
p249
aVI grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s
p250
aVwatching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon.
p251
aVAnd I was five years old,
p252
aVand I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job;
p253
aVafter all, they were very proficient \u2014
p254
aVbut just seeing that as a kid
p255
aVmade me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me,
p256
aVthat "impossible is just the possible
p257
aVthat someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true."
p258
aa(lp259
VSo they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk.
p260
aVI think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice.
p261
aa(lp262
VThank you.
