VWhat if I told you there was a new technology
p4
aVthat, when placed in the hands of doctors and nurses,
p5
aVimproved outcomes for children and adults, patients of all ages;
p6
aVreduced pain and suffering,
p7
aVreduced time in the operating rooms,
p8
aVreduced anesthetic times,
p9
aVhad the ultimate dose-response curve
p10
aVthat the more you did it,
p11
aVthe better it benefitted patients?
p12
aVHere's a kicker: it has no side effects,
p13
aVand it's available no matter where care is delivered.
p14
aVI can tell you as an ICU doctor at Boston Children's Hospital,
p15
aVthis would be a game changer for me.
p16
aVThat technology is lifelike rehearsal.
p17
aVThis lifelike rehearsal is being delivered through medical simulation.
p18
aa(lp19
VI thought I would start with a case,
p20
aVjust to really describe the challenge ahead,
p21
aVand why this technology is not just going to improve health care
p22
aVbut why it's critical to health care.
p23
aVThis is a child that's born, young girl.
p24
aV"Day of life zero," we call it,
p25
aVthe first day of life, just born into the world.
p26
aVAnd just as she's being born,
p27
aVwe notice very quickly that she is deteriorating.
p28
aVHer heart rate is going up, her blood pressure is going down,
p29
aVshe's breathing very, very fast.
p30
aVAnd the reason for this is displayed in this chest X-ray.
p31
aa(lp32
VThat's called a babygram,
p33
aVa full X-ray of a child's body, a little infant's body.
p34
aVAs you look on the top side of this,
p35
aVthat's where the heart and lungs are supposed to be.
p36
aVAs you look at the bottom end, that's where the abdomen is,
p37
aVand that's where the intestines are supposed to be.
p38
aVAnd you can see how there's sort of that translucent area
p39
aVthat made its way up into the right side of this child's chest.
p40
aVAnd those are the intestines \u2014 in the wrong place.
p41
aVAs a result, they're pushing on the lungs
p42
aVand making it very difficult for this poor baby to breathe.
p43
aa(lp44
VThe fix for this problem
p45
aVis to take this child immediately to the operating room,
p46
aVbring those intestines back into the abdomen,
p47
aVlet the lungs expand
p48
aVand allow this child to breathe again.
p49
aVBut before she can go to the operating room,
p50
aVshe must get whisked away to the ICU, where I work.
p51
aVI work with surgical teams.
p52
aVWe gather around her,
p53
aVand we place this child on heart-lung bypass.
p54
aVWe put her to sleep,
p55
aVwe make a tiny little incision in the neck,
p56
aVwe place catheters into the major vessels of the neck \u2014
p57
aVand I can tell you that these vessels are about the size of a pen,
p58
aVthe tip of a pen \u2014
p59
aVand then we have blood drawn from the body,
p60
aVwe bring it through a machine, it gets oxygenated,
p61
aVand it goes back into the body.
p62
aVWe save her life,
p63
aVand get her safely to the operating room.
p64
aa(lp65
VHere's the problem:
p66
aVthese disorders \u2014
p67
aVwhat is known is congenital diaphragmatic hernia \u2014
p68
aVthis hole in the diaphragm that has allowed these intestines to sneak up \u2014
p69
aVthese disorders are rare.
p70
aVEven in the best hands in the world,
p71
aVthere is still a challenge to get the volume \u2014
p72
aVthe natural volume of these patients \u2014
p73
aVin order to get our expertise curve at 100 percent.
p74
aVThey just don't present that often.
p75
aVSo how do you make the rare common?
p76
aa(lp77
VHere's the other problem:
p78
aVin the health care system that I trained for over 20 years,
p79
aVwhat currently exists,
p80
aVthe model of training is called the apprenticeship model.
p81
aVIt's been around for centuries.
p82
aVIt's based on this idea that you see a surgery maybe once,
p83
aVmaybe several times,
p84
aVyou then go do that surgery,
p85
aVand then ultimately you teach that surgery to the next generation.
p86
aVAnd implicit in this model \u2014
p87
aVI don't need to tell you this \u2014
p88
aVis that we practice on the very patients that we are delivering care to.
p89
aVThat's a problem.
p90
aVI think there's a better approach.
p91
aVMedicine may very well be the last high-stakes industry
p92
aVthat does not practice prior to game time.
p93
aVI want to describe to you a better approach through medical simulation.
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, the first thing we did is we went to other high-stakes industries
p96
aVthat had been using this type of methodology for decades.
p97
aVThis is nuclear power.
p98
aVNuclear power runs scenarios on a regular basis
p99
aVin order to practice what they hope will never occur.
p100
aVAnd as we're all very familiar, the airline industry \u2014
p101
aVwe all get on planes now, comforted by the idea
p102
aVthat pilots and crews have trained on simulators much like these,
p103
aVtraining on scenarios that we hope will never occur,
p104
aVbut we know if they did,
p105
aVthey would be prepared for the worst.
p106
aVIn fact, the airline industry has gone as far as to create fuselages
p107
aVof simulation environments,
p108
aVbecause of the importance of the team coming together.
p109
aVThis is an evacuation drill simulator.
p110
aVSo again, if that ever were to happen, these rare, rare events,
p111
aVthey're ready to act on the drop of a dime.
p112
aa(lp113
VI guess the most compelling for me in some ways is the sports industry \u2014
p114
aVarguably high stakes.
p115
aVYou think about a baseball team: baseball players practice.
p116
aVI think it's a beautiful example of progressive training.
p117
aVThe first thing they do is go out to spring training.
p118
aVThey go to a spring training camp,
p119
aVperhaps a simulator in baseball.
p120
aVThey're not on the real field, but they're on a simulated field,
p121
aVand they're playing in the pregame season.
p122
aVThen they make their way to the field during the season games,
p123
aVand what's the first thing they do before they start the game?
p124
aVThey go into the batting cage and do batting practice for hours,
p125
aVhaving different types of pitches being thrown at them,
p126
aVhitting ball after ball as they limber their muscles,
p127
aVgetting ready for the game itself.
p128
aVAnd here's the most phenomenal part of this,
p129
aVand for all of you who watch any sport event,
p130
aVyou will see this phenomenon happen.
p131
aVThe batter gets into the batter's box,
p132
aVthe pitcher gets ready to pitch.
p133
aVRight before the pitch is thrown,
p134
aVwhat does that batter do?
p135
aVThe batter steps out of the box
p136
aVand takes a practice swing.
p137
aVHe wouldn't do it any other way.
p138
aa(lp139
VI want to talk to you about how we're building practice swings like this
p140
aVin medicine.
p141
aVWe are building batting cages for the patients that we care about
p142
aVat Boston Children's.
p143
aVI want to use this case that we recently built.
p144
aVIt's the case of a four-year-old who had a progressively enlarging head,
p145
aVand as a result,
p146
aVhad loss of developmental milestones, neurologic milestones,
p147
aVand the reason for this problem is here \u2014
p148
aVit's called hydrocephalus.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo, a quick study in neurosurgery.
p151
aVThere's the brain,
p152
aVand you can see the cranium surrounding the brain.
p153
aVWhat surrounds the brain, between the brain and cranium,
p154
aVis something called cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,
p155
aVwhich acts as a shock absorber.
p156
aVIn your heads right now,
p157
aVthere is cerebrospinal fluid just bathing your brains
p158
aVand making its way around.
p159
aVIt's produced in one area and flows through,
p160
aVand then is re-exchanged.
p161
aVAnd this beautiful flow pattern occurs for all of us.
p162
aVBut unfortunately in some children,
p163
aVthere's a blockage of this flow pattern,
p164
aVmuch like a traffic jam.
p165
aVAs a result, the fluid accumulates,
p166
aVand the brain is pushed aside.
p167
aVIt has difficulty growing.
p168
aVAs a result, the child loses neurologic milestones.
p169
aVThis is a devastating disease in children.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe cure for this is surgery.
p172
aVThe traditional surgery is to take a bit of the cranium off,
p173
aVa bit of the skull,
p174
aVdrain this fluid out, stick a drain in place,
p175
aVand then eventually bring this drain internal to the body.
p176
aVBig operation.
p177
aVBut some great news is that advances in neurosurgical care
p178
aVhave allowed us to develop minimally invasive approaches
p179
aVto this surgery.
p180
aVThrough a small pinhole, a camera can be inserted,
p181
aVled into the deep brain structure,
p182
aVand cause a little hole in a membrane that allows all that fluid to drain,
p183
aVmuch like it would in a sink.
p184
aVAll of a sudden, the brain is no longer under pressure,
p185
aVcan re-expand
p186
aVand we cure the child through a single-hole incision.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut here's the problem:
p189
aVhydrocephalus is relatively rare.
p190
aVAnd there are no good training methods
p191
aVto get really good at getting this scope to the right place.
p192
aVBut surgeons have been quite creative about this, even our own.
p193
aVAnd they've come up with training models.
p194
aVHere's the current training model.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VI kid you not.
p199
aVThis is a red pepper, not made in Hollywood;
p200
aVit's real red pepper.
p201
aVAnd what surgeons do is they stick a scope into the pepper,
p202
aVand they do what is called a "seedectomy."
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThey use this scope to remove seeds using a little tweezer.
p207
aVAnd that is a way to get under their belts
p208
aVthe rudimentary components of doing this surgery.
p209
aVThen they head right into the apprenticeship model,
p210
aVseeing many of them as they present themselves,
p211
aVthen doing it, and then teaching it \u2014
p212
aVwaiting for these patients to arrive.
p213
aVWe can do a lot better.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe are manufacturing reproductions of children
p216
aVin order for surgeons and surgical teams to rehearse
p217
aVin the most relevant possible ways.
p218
aVLet me show you this.
p219
aVHere's my team
p220
aVin what's called the SIM Engineering Division of the Simulator Program.
p221
aVThis is an amazing team of individuals.
p222
aVThey are mechanical engineers;
p223
aVyou're seeing here, illustrators.
p224
aVThey take primary data from CT scans and MRIs,
p225
aVtranslate it into digital information,
p226
aVanimate it,
p227
aVput it together into the components of the child itself,
p228
aVsurface-scan elements of the child that have been casted as needed,
p229
aVdepending on the surgery itself,
p230
aVand then take this digital data and be able to output it
p231
aVon state-of-the-art, three-dimensional printing devices
p232
aVthat allow us to print the components
p233
aVexactly to the micron detail of what the child's anatomy will look like.
p234
aVYou can see here,
p235
aVthe skull of this child being printed
p236
aVin the hours before we performed this surgery.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut we could not do this work
p239
aVwithout our dear friends on the West Coast in Hollywood, California.
p240
aVThese are individuals that are incredibly talented
p241
aVat being able to recreate reality.
p242
aVIt was not a long leap for us.
p243
aVThe more we got into this field,
p244
aVthe more it became clear to us that we are doing cinematography.
p245
aVWe're doing filmmaking,
p246
aVit's just that the actors are not actors.
p247
aVThey're real doctors and nurses.
p248
aVSo these are some photos of our dear friends at Fractured FX
p249
aVin Hollywood California,
p250
aVan Emmy-Award-winning special effects firm.
p251
aVThis is Justin Raleigh and his group \u2014
p252
aVthis is not one of our patients \u2014
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
Vbut kind of the exquisite work that these individuals do.
p257
aVWe have now collaborated and fused our experience,
p258
aVbringing their group to Boston Children's Hospital,
p259
aVsending our group out to Hollywood, California
p260
aVand exchanging around this
p261
aVto be able to develop these type of simulators.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhat I'm about to show you is a reproduction of this child.
p264
aVYou'll notice here that every hair on the child's head is reproduced.
p265
aVAnd in fact, this is also that reproduced child \u2014
p266
aVand I apologize for any queasy stomachs,
p267
aVbut that is a reproduction and simulation
p268
aVof the child they're about to operate on.
p269
aVHere's that membrane we had talked about,
p270
aVthe inside of this child's brain.
p271
aVWhat you're going to be seeing here is, on one side, the actual patient,
p272
aVand on the other side, the simulator.
p273
aVAs I mentioned, a scope, a little camera, needs to make its way down,
p274
aVand you're seeing that here.
p275
aVIt needs to make a small hole in this membrane
p276
aVand allow this fluid to seep out.
p277
aVI won't do a quiz show to see who thinks which side is which,
p278
aVbut on the right is the simulator.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo surgeons can now produce training opportunities,
p281
aVdo these surgeries as many times as they want,
p282
aVto their heart's content, until they feel comfortable.
p283
aVAnd then, and only then, bring the child into the operating room.
p284
aVBut we don't stop here.
p285
aVWe know that a key step to this is not just the skill itself,
p286
aVbut combining that skill with a team who's going to deliver that care.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow we turn to Formula One.
p289
aVAnd here is an example of a technician putting on a tire
p290
aVand doing that time and time again on this car.
p291
aVBut that is very quickly going to be incorporated
p292
aVwithin team-training experiences,
p293
aVnow as a full team orchestrating the exchange of tires
p294
aVand getting this car back on the speedway.
p295
aVWe've done that step in health care,
p296
aVso now what you're about to see is a simulated operation.
p297
aVWe've taken the simulator I just described to you,
p298
aVwe've brought it into the operating room at Boston Children's Hospital,
p299
aVand these individuals \u2014 these native teams, operative teams \u2014
p300
aVare doing the surgery before the surgery.
p301
aVOperate twice;
p302
aVcut once.
p303
aVLet me show that to you.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Video) Surgical team member 1: You want the head down or head up?
p306
aa(lp307
VSTM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?
p308
aa(lp309
VSTM 3: And then lower the whole table down a little bit?
p310
aa(lp311
VSTM 4: Table coming down.
p312
aa(lp313
VSTM 3: All right, this is behaving like a vessel.
p314
aVCould we have the scissors back, please?
p315
aa(lp316
VSTM 5: I'm taking my gloves, 8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.
p317
aa(lp318
VSTM 6: Great! Thank you.
p319
aa(lp320
VPeter Weinstock: It's really amazing.
p321
aVThe second step to this, which is critical,
p322
aVis we take these teams out immediately and debrief them.
p323
aVWe use the same technologies
p324
aVthat are used in Lean and Six Sigma in the military,
p325
aVand we bring them out and talk about what went right,
p326
aVbut more importantly,
p327
aVwe talk about what didn't go well,
p328
aVand how we're going to fix it.
p329
aVThen we bring them right back in and do it again.
p330
aVDeliberative batting practice in the moments when it matters most.
p331
aa(lp332
VLet's go back to this case now.
p333
aVSame child,
p334
aVbut now let me describe how we care for this child
p335
aVat Boston Children's Hospital.
p336
aVThis child was born at three o'clock in the morning.
p337
aVAt two o'clock in the morning,
p338
aVwe assembled the team,
p339
aVand took the reproduced anatomy
p340
aVthat we would gain out of scans and images,
p341
aVand brought that team to the virtual bedside,
p342
aVto a simulated bedside \u2014
p343
aVthe same team that's going to operate on this child in the hours ahead \u2014
p344
aVand we have them do the procedure.
p345
aVLet me show you a moment of this.
p346
aVThis is not a real incision.
p347
aVAnd the baby has not yet been born.
p348
aVImagine this.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo now the conversations that I have with families
p351
aVin the intensive care unit at Boston Children's Hospital
p352
aVare totally different.
p353
aVImagine this conversation:
p354
aV"Not only do we take care of this disorder frequently in our ICU,
p355
aVand not only have we done surgeries
p356
aVlike the surgery we're going to do on your child,
p357
aVbut we have done your child's surgery.
p358
aVAnd we did it two hours ago.
p359
aVAnd we did it 10 times.
p360
aVAnd now we're prepared to take them back to the operating room."
p361
aa(lp362
VSo a new technology in health care:
p363
aVlifelike rehearsal.
p364
aVPracticing prior to game time.
p365
aa(lp366
VThank you.
