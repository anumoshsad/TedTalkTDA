VWhat do you guys think?
p4
aVFor those who watched Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk,
p5
aVI am a typical example  of what he describes
p6
aVas "the body as a form of transport for the head,"
p7
aVa university professor.
p8
aa(lp9
VYou might think it was not fair
p10
aVthat I've been lined up to speak after these first two talks
p11
aVto speak about science.
p12
aVI can't move my body to the beat,
p13
aVand after a scientist who became a philosopher,
p14
aVI have to talk about hard science.
p15
aVIt could be a very dry subject.
p16
aVYet, I feel honored.
p17
aVNever in my career,
p18
aVand it's been a long career,
p19
aVhave I had the opportunity to start a talk
p20
aVfeeling so inspired, like this one.
p21
aa(lp22
VUsually, talking about science
p23
aVis like exercising in a dry place.
p24
aVHowever, I've had the pleasure
p25
aVof being invited to come here to talk about water.
p26
aVThe words "water" and "dry" do not match, right?
p27
aVIt is even better to talk about water in the Amazon,
p28
aVwhich is the splendid cradle  of life. Fresh life.
p29
aVSo this is what inspired me.
p30
aVThat's why I'm here, although I'm carrying
p31
aVmy head over here.
p32
aVI am trying, or will try to convey this inspiration.
p33
aVI hope this story will inspire you and that you'll spread the word.
p34
aa(lp35
VWe know that there is controversy.
p36
aVThe Amazon is the "lung of the world,"
p37
aVbecause of its massive power to have vital gases exchanged
p38
aVbetween the forest and the atmosphere.
p39
aVWe also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity.
p40
aVWhile many believe it,
p41
aVfew know it.
p42
aVIf you go out there, in this marsh,
p43
aVyou'll be amazed at the \u2014
p44
aVYou can barely see the animals.
p45
aVThe Indians say, "The forest has more eyes than leaves."
p46
aVThat is true, and I will try to show you something.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut today, I'm going to use a different approach,
p49
aVone that is inspired by these two initiatives here,
p50
aVa harmonic one and a philosophical one.
p51
aVI'll try to use an approach that's slightly materialistic,
p52
aVbut it also attempts to convey that, in nature, there is
p53
aVextraordinary philosophy and harmony.
p54
aVThere'll be no music in my presentation,
p55
aVbut I hope you'll all notice the music of the reality I'm going to show you.
p56
aVI'm going to talk about physiology \u2014 not about lungs,
p57
aVbut other analogies with human physiology,
p58
aVespecially the heart.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe'll start
p61
aVby thinking that water is like blood.
p62
aVThe circulation in our body distributes fresh blood,
p63
aVwhich feeds, nurtures and supports us,
p64
aVand brings the used blood back to be renewed.
p65
aVIn the Amazon, things happen similarly.
p66
aVWe'll start by talking about the power of all these processes.
p67
aVThis is an image
p68
aVof rain in motion.
p69
aVWhat you see there is the years passing in seconds.
p70
aVRains all over the world. What do you see?
p71
aVThe equatorial region, in general,
p72
aVand the Amazon specifically,
p73
aVis extremely important for the world's climate.
p74
aVIt's a powerful engine.
p75
aVThere is a frantic evaporation taking place here.
p76
aa(lp77
VIf we take a look at this other image,
p78
aVwhich shows the water vapor flow,
p79
aVyou have dry air in black, moist air in gray,
p80
aVand clouds in white.
p81
aVWhat you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon.
p82
aVWhat phenomenon \u2014 if it's not a desert,
p83
aVwhat phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere
p84
aVwith such power  that it can be seen from space?
p85
aVWhat phenomenon is this?
p86
aVIt could be a geyser.
p87
aVA geyser is underground water heated by magma,
p88
aVexploding into the atmosphere
p89
aVand transferring this water  into the atmosphere.
p90
aVThere are no geysers in the Amazon, unless I am wrong.
p91
aVI don't know of any.
p92
aVBut we have something that plays the same role,
p93
aVwith much more elegance though:
p94
aVthe trees, our good old friends
p95
aVthat, like geysers,
p96
aVcan transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere.
p97
aa(lp98
VThere are 600 billion trees in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.
p99
aVThat is done with an extraordinary sophistication.
p100
aVThey don't need the heat of magma.
p101
aVThey use sunlight to do this process.
p102
aVSo, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,
p103
aVa big tree manages to transfer 1,000 liters of water
p104
aVthrough its transpiration \u2014
p105
aV1,000 liters.
p106
aVIf we take all the Amazon,
p107
aVwhich is a very large area,
p108
aVand add it up to all that water that is released by transpiration,
p109
aVwhich is the sweat of the forest,
p110
aVwe'll get to an incredible number:
p111
aV20 billion metric tons of water.
p112
aVIn one day.
p113
aa(lp114
VDo you know how much that is?
p115
aVThe Amazon River, the largest river on Earth,
p116
aVone fifth of all the fresh water
p117
aVthat leaves the continents of the whole world and ends up in the oceans,
p118
aVdumps 17 billion metric tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.
p119
aVThis river of vapor
p120
aVthat comes up from the forest and goes into the atmosphere
p121
aVis greater than the Amazon River.
p122
aVJust to give you an idea.
p123
aVIf we could take a gigantic kettle,
p124
aVthe kind you could plug into a power socket, an electric one,
p125
aVand put those 20 billion metric tons of water in it,
p126
aVhow much power would you need to have this water evaporated?
p127
aVAny idea? A really big kettle.
p128
aVA gigantic kettle, right?
p129
aV50 thousand Itaipus.
p130
aVItaipu is still the largest hydroelectric plant in the world.
p131
aVand Brazil is very proud of it
p132
aVbecause it provides more  than 30 percent of the power
p133
aVthat is consumed in Brazil.
p134
aVAnd the Amazon is here, doing this for free.
p135
aVIt's a vivid and extremely powerful plant, providing environmental services.
p136
aa(lp137
VRelated to this subject,
p138
aVwe are going to talk about what I call the paradox of chance,
p139
aVwhich is curious.
p140
aVIf you look at the world map \u2014
p141
aVit's easy to see this \u2014
p142
aVyou'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone,
p143
aVand deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude,
p144
aV30 degrees south latitude, aligned.
p145
aVLook over there, in the southern hemisphere, the Atacama;
p146
aVNamibia and Kalahari in Africa; the Australian desert.
p147
aVIn the northern hemisphere, the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.
p148
aVThere is an exception, and it's curious:
p149
aVIt's the quadrangle that ranges from Cuiabá to Buenos Aires,
p150
aVand from São Paulo to the Andes.
p151
aVThis quadrangle was supposed to be a desert.
p152
aVIt's on the line of deserts.
p153
aVWhy isn't it? That's why I call it the paradox of chance.
p154
aVWhat do we have in South America that is different?
p155
aa(lp156
VIf we could use the analogy
p157
aVof the blood circulating in our bodies,
p158
aVlike the water circulating in the landscape,
p159
aVwe see that rivers are veins,
p160
aVthey drain the landscape, they drain the tissue of nature.
p161
aVWhere are the arteries?
p162
aVAny guess?
p163
aVWhat takes \u2014
p164
aVHow does water get to irrigate the tissues of nature
p165
aVand bring everything back through rivers?
p166
aVThere is a new type of river,
p167
aVwhich originates in the blue sea,
p168
aVwhich flows through the green ocean \u2014
p169
aVit not only flows, but it is also pumped by the green ocean \u2014
p170
aVand then it falls on our land.
p171
aVAll our economy, that quadrangle,
p172
aV70 percent of South America's  GDP comes from that area.
p173
aVIt depends on this river.
p174
aVThis river flows invisibly above us.
p175
aVWe are floating here on this floating hotel,
p176
aVon one of the largest rivers on Earth, the Negro River.
p177
aVIt's a bit dry and rough, but we are floating here,
p178
aVand there is this invisible river running above us.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis river has a pulse.
p181
aVHere it is, pulsing.
p182
aVThat's why we also talk about the heart.
p183
aVYou can see the different seasons there.
p184
aVThere's the rainy season. In the Amazon, we used to have two seasons,
p185
aVthe humid season and the even more humid season.
p186
aVNow we have a dry season.
p187
aVYou can see the river covering that region
p188
aVwhich, otherwise, would be a desert. And it is not.
p189
aa(lp190
VWe, scientists \u2014 You see that I'm struggling here
p191
aVto move my head from one side to the other.
p192
aVScientists study how it works, why, etc.
p193
aVand these studies are generating a series of discoveries,
p194
aVwhich are absolutely fabulous,
p195
aVto raise our awareness of the wealth,
p196
aVthe complexity, and the wonder that we have,
p197
aVthe symphony we have in this process.
p198
aVOne of them is: How is rain formed?
p199
aVAbove the Amazon, there is clean air,
p200
aVas there is clean air above the ocean.
p201
aVThe blue sea has clean air above it and forms pretty few clouds;
p202
aVthere's almost no rain there.
p203
aVThe green ocean has the same clean air, but forms a lot of rain.
p204
aVWhat is happening here that is different?
p205
aa(lp206
VThe forest emits smells,
p207
aVand these smells are condensation nuclei,
p208
aVwhich form drops in the atmosphere.
p209
aVThen, clouds are formed and there is torrential rain.
p210
aVThe sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.
p211
aVThis relation between a living thing, which is the forest,
p212
aVand a nonliving thing, which is the atmosphere,
p213
aVis ingenious in the Amazon,
p214
aVbecause the forest provides water and seeds,
p215
aVand the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back,
p216
aVguaranteeing the forest's survival.
p217
aa(lp218
VThere are other factors as well.
p219
aVWe've talked a little about the heart,
p220
aVand let's now talk about another function: the liver!
p221
aVWhen humid air, high humidity and radiation are combined
p222
aVwith these organic compounds,
p223
aVwhich I call exogenous vitamin C, generous vitamin C in the form of gas,
p224
aVthe plants release antioxidants
p225
aVwhich react with pollutants.
p226
aVYou can rest assured
p227
aVthat you are breathing the purest air on Earth, here in the Amazon,
p228
aVbecause the plants take care of this characteristic as well.
p229
aVThis benefits the very way plants work,
p230
aVwhich is another ingenious cycle.
p231
aa(lp232
VSpeaking of fractals,
p233
aVand their relation with the way we work,
p234
aVwe can establish other comparisons.
p235
aVAs in the upper airways of our lungs,
p236
aVthe air in the Amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.
p237
aVThe dust in the air that we breathe is cleaned by our airways.
p238
aVThis keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall.
p239
aVWhen there are fires in the Amazon,
p240
aVthe smoke stops the rain,  it stops raining,
p241
aVthe forest dries up and catches fire.
p242
aVThere is another fractal analogy.
p243
aVLike in the veins and arteries,
p244
aVthe rain water is a feedback.
p245
aVIt returns to the atmosphere.
p246
aVLike endocrinal glands and hormones,
p247
aVthere are those gases which I told you about before,
p248
aVthat are formed and released into the atmosphere, like hormones,
p249
aVwhich help in the formation of rain.
p250
aVLike the liver and the kidneys, as I've said, cleaning the air.
p251
aVAnd, finally, like the heart:
p252
aVpumping water from outside, from the sea,
p253
aVinto the forest.
p254
aVWe call it the biotic moisture pump,
p255
aVa new theory that is explained in a very simple way.
p256
aa(lp257
VIf there is a desert in the continent
p258
aVwith a nearby sea,
p259
aVevaporation's greater on the sea,
p260
aVand it sucks the air above the desert.
p261
aVThe desert is trapped in this condition. It will always be dry.
p262
aVIf you have the opposite situation, a forest,
p263
aVthe evaporation, as we showed, is much greater, because of the trees,
p264
aVand this relation is reversed.
p265
aVThe air above the sea is sucked into the continent
p266
aVand humidity is imported.
p267
aVThis satellite image was taken one month ago \u2014
p268
aVthat's Manaus down there, we're down there \u2014
p269
aVand it shows this process.
p270
aVIt's not a common little river that flows into a canal.
p271
aVIt's a mighty river that irrigates South America,
p272
aVamong other things.
p273
aVThis image shows those paths,
p274
aVall the hurricanes that have been recorded.
p275
aVYou can see that, in the red square, there hardly are any hurricanes.
p276
aVThat is no accident.
p277
aVThis pump that sucks the moisture into the continent
p278
aValso speeds up the air above the sea,
p279
aVand this prevents hurricane formations.
p280
aa(lp281
VTo close this part and sum up,
p282
aVI'd like to talk about something a little different.
p283
aVI have several colleagues
p284
aVwho worked in the development of these theories.
p285
aVThey think, and so do I,
p286
aVthat we can save planet Earth.
p287
aVI'm not talking only about the Amazon.
p288
aVThe Amazon teaches us a lesson
p289
aVon how pristine nature works.
p290
aVWe didn't understand these processes before
p291
aVbecause the rest of the world is messed up.
p292
aVWe could understand it here, though.
p293
aVThese colleagues propose that, yes, we can
p294
aVsave other areas,
p295
aVincluding deserts.
p296
aVIf we could establish forests in those other areas,
p297
aVwe can reverse climate change,
p298
aVincluding global warming.
p299
aa(lp300
VI have a dear colleague in India,
p301
aVwhose name is Suprabha Seshan, and she has a motto.
p302
aVHer motto is, "Gardening back the biosphere,"
p303
aV"Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.
p304
aVShe does a wonderful job rebuilding ecosystems.
p305
aVWe need to do this.
p306
aVHaving closed this quick introduction,
p307
aVwe see the reality that we have out here,
p308
aVwhich is drought, this climate change,
p309
aVthings that we already knew.
p310
aa(lp311
VI'd like to tell you a short story.
p312
aVOnce, about four years ago,
p313
aVI attended a declamation, of a text by Davi Kopenawa,
p314
aVa wise representative of the Yanomami people,
p315
aVand it went more or less like this:
p316
aV"Doesn't the white man know
p317
aVthat, if he destroys the forest, there will be no more rain?
p318
aVAnd that, if there's no more rain,
p319
aVthere'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"
p320
aVI heard that, and my eyes welled up
p321
aVand I went, "Oh, my!
p322
aVI've been studying this for 20 years, with a super computer,
p323
aVdozens, thousands of scientists,
p324
aVand we are starting to get to this conclusion, which he already knows!"
p325
aVA critical point is the Yanomami have never deforested.
p326
aVHow could they know the rain would end?
p327
aVThis bugged me and I was befuddled.
p328
aVHow could he know that?
p329
aa(lp330
VSome months later, I met him at another event and said,
p331
aV"Davi, how did you know that if the forest was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"
p332
aVHe replied: "The spirit of the forest told us."
p333
aVFor me, this was a game changer,
p334
aVa radical change.
p335
aVI said, "Gosh!
p336
aVWhy am I doing all this science
p337
aVto get to a conclusion that he already knows?"
p338
aVThen, something  absolutely critical hit me,
p339
aVwhich is,
p340
aVseeing is believing.
p341
aVOut of sight, out of mind.
p342
aVThis is a need the previous speaker pointed out:
p343
aVWe need to see things \u2014
p344
aVI mean, we, Western society,
p345
aVwhich is becoming global, civilized \u2014
p346
aVwe need to see.
p347
aVIf we don't see, we don't register the information.
p348
aVWe live in ignorance.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, I propose the following \u2014
p351
aVof course, the astronomer wouldn't like the idea \u2014
p352
aVbut let's turn the Hubble telescope upside down.
p353
aVAnd let's make it look down here,
p354
aVrather than to the far reaches of the universe.
p355
aVThe universe is wonderful,
p356
aVbut we have a practical reality,
p357
aVwhich is we live in an unknown cosmos,
p358
aVand we're ignorant about it.
p359
aVWe're trampling on this wonderful cosmos
p360
aVthat shelters us and houses us.
p361
aVTalk to any astrophysicist.
p362
aVThe Earth is a statistical improbability.
p363
aVThe stability and comfort that we enjoy, despite the droughts of the Negro River,
p364
aVand all the heat and cold and typhoons, etc.,
p365
aVthere is nothing like it in the universe, that we know of.
p366
aa(lp367
VThen, let's turn Hubble in our direction,
p368
aVand let's look at the Earth.
p369
aVLet's start with the Amazon!
p370
aVLet's dive,
p371
aVlet's reach out the reality we live in every day,
p372
aVand look carefully at it, since that's what we need.
p373
aVDavi Kopenawa doesn't need this.
p374
aVHe has something already that I think I missed.
p375
aVI was educated by television.
p376
aVI think that I missed this,
p377
aVan ancestral record,
p378
aVa valuation of what I don't know, what I haven't seen.
p379
aVHe is not a doubting Thomas.
p380
aVHe believes,  with veneration and reverence,
p381
aVin what his ancestors and the spirits taught him.
p382
aVWe can't do it, so let's look into the forest.
p383
aVEven with Hubble up there \u2014
p384
aVthis is a bird's-eye view, right?
p385
aVEven when this happens,
p386
aVwe also see something that we don't know.
p387
aVThe Spanish called it the green inferno.
p388
aVIf you go out there into the bushes and get lost,
p389
aVand, let's say, if you head west,
p390
aVit's 900 kilometers to Colombia,
p391
aVand another 1,000 to somewhere else.
p392
aVSo, you can figure out why they called it the green inferno.
p393
aa(lp394
VBut go and look at what is in there.
p395
aVIt is a live carpet.
p396
aVEach color you see is a tree species.
p397
aVEach tree, each tree top,
p398
aVhas up to 10,000 species of insects in it,
p399
aVlet alone the millions of species of fungi, bacteria, etc.
p400
aVAll invisible.
p401
aVAll of it is an even stranger cosmos to us
p402
aVthan the galaxies billions of light years away from the Earth,
p403
aVwhich Hubble brings to our newspapers everyday.
p404
aa(lp405
VI'm going to end my talk here \u2014
p406
aVI have a few seconds left \u2014
p407
aVby showing you this wonderful being.
p408
aVWhen we see the morpho butterfly in the forest,
p409
aVwe feel like someone's left open the door to heaven,
p410
aVand this creature escaped from there, because it's so beautiful.
p411
aVHowever, I cannot finish
p412
aVwithout showing you a tech side.
p413
aVWe are tech-arrogant.
p414
aVWe deprive nature of its technology.
p415
aVA robotic hand is technological,
p416
aVmine is biological,
p417
aVand we don't think about it anymore.
p418
aa(lp419
VLet's then look at the morpho butterfly,
p420
aVan example of an invisible technological competence of life,
p421
aVwhich is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet,
p422
aVand let's zoom in on it. Again, Hubble is there.
p423
aVLet's get into the butterfly's wings.
p424
aVScholars have tried to explain: Why is it blue?
p425
aVLet's zoom in on it.
p426
aVWhat you see is that the architecture of the invisible humiliates
p427
aVthe best architects in the world.
p428
aVAll of this on a tiny scale.
p429
aVBesides its beauty and functioning, there is another side to it.
p430
aVIn nature,
p431
aVall that is organized in extraordinary structures has a function.
p432
aVThis function of the morpho butterfly \u2014 it is not blue;
p433
aVit does not have blue pigments.
p434
aVIt has photonic crystals on its surface, according to people who studied it,
p435
aVwhich are extremely  sophisticated crystals.
p436
aVOur technology had nothing like that at the time.
p437
aVHitachi has now made a monitor
p438
aVthat uses this technology,
p439
aVand it is used in optical fibers to transmit \u2014
p440
aVJanine Benyus, who's been here several times, talks about it: biomimetics.
p441
aVMy time's up.
p442
aa(lp443
VThen, I'll wrap it up with what is at the base of this capacity,
p444
aVof this competence of biodiversity,
p445
aVproducing all these wonderful services:
