VThe electricity powering the lights in this theater
p4
aVwas generated just moments ago.
p5
aVBecause the way things stand today,
p6
aVelectricity demand must be in constant balance
p7
aVwith electricity supply.
p8
aVIf in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,
p9
aVsome tens of megawatts of wind power
p10
aVstopped pouring into the grid,
p11
aVthe difference would have to be made up
p12
aVfrom other generators immediately.
p13
aVBut coal plants, nuclear plants
p14
aVcan't respond fast enough.
p15
aVA giant battery could.
p16
aVWith a giant battery,
p17
aVwe'd be able to address the problem of intermittency
p18
aVthat prevents wind and solar
p19
aVfrom contributing to the grid
p20
aVin the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.
p21
aa(lp22
VYou see, the battery
p23
aVis the key enabling device here.
p24
aVWith it, we could draw electricity from the sun
p25
aVeven when the sun doesn't shine.
p26
aVAnd that changes everything.
p27
aVBecause then renewables
p28
aVsuch as wind and solar
p29
aVcome out from the wings,
p30
aVhere to center stage.
p31
aVToday I want to tell you about such a device.
p32
aVIt's called the liquid metal battery.
p33
aVIt's a new form of energy storage
p34
aVthat I invented at MIT
p35
aValong with a team of my students
p36
aVand post-docs.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.
p39
aVThe OED defines spectrum
p40
aVas "The entire range of wavelengths
p41
aVof electromagnetic radiation,
p42
aVfrom the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays
p43
aVof which the range of visible light
p44
aVis only a small part."
p45
aVSo I'm not here today only to tell you
p46
aVhow my team at MIT has drawn out of nature
p47
aVa solution to one of the world's great problems.
p48
aVI want to go full spectrum and tell you how,
p49
aVin the process of developing
p50
aVthis new technology,
p51
aVwe've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies
p52
aVthat can serve as lessons for innovation,
p53
aVideas worth spreading.
p54
aVAnd you know,
p55
aVif we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,
p56
aVwe can't just conserve our way out;
p57
aVwe can't just drill our way out;
p58
aVwe can't bomb our way out.
p59
aVWe're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,
p60
aVwe're going to invent our way out,
p61
aVworking together.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VNow let's get started.
p66
aVThe battery was invented about 200 years ago
p67
aVby a professor, Alessandro Volta,
p68
aVat the University of Padua in Italy.
p69
aVHis invention gave birth to a new field of science,
p70
aVelectrochemistry,
p71
aVand new technologies
p72
aVsuch as electroplating.
p73
aVPerhaps overlooked,
p74
aVVolta's invention of the battery
p75
aVfor the first time also
p76
aVdemonstrated the utility of a professor.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVUntil Volta, nobody could imagine
p79
aVa professor could be of any use.
p80
aa(lp81
VHere's the first battery \u2014
p82
aVa stack of coins, zinc and silver,
p83
aVseparated by cardboard soaked in brine.
p84
aVThis is the starting point
p85
aVfor designing a battery \u2014
p86
aVtwo electrodes,
p87
aVin this case metals of different composition,
p88
aVand an electrolyte,
p89
aVin this case salt dissolved in water.
p90
aVThe science is that simple.
p91
aVAdmittedly, I've left out a few details.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow I've taught you
p94
aVthat battery science is straightforward
p95
aVand the need for grid-level storage
p96
aVis compelling,
p97
aVbut the fact is
p98
aVthat today there is simply no battery technology
p99
aVcapable of meeting
p100
aVthe demanding performance requirements of the grid \u2014
p101
aVnamely uncommonly high power,
p102
aVlong service lifetime
p103
aVand super-low cost.
p104
aVWe need to think about the problem differently.
p105
aVWe need to think big,
p106
aVwe need to think cheap.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo let's abandon the paradigm
p109
aVof let's search for the coolest chemistry
p110
aVand then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve
p111
aVby just making lots and lots of product.
p112
aVInstead, let's invent
p113
aVto the price point of the electricity market.
p114
aVSo that means
p115
aVthat certain parts of the periodic table
p116
aVare axiomatically off-limits.
p117
aVThis battery needs to be made
p118
aVout of earth-abundant elements.
p119
aVI say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,
p120
aVmake it out of dirt \u2014
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVpreferably dirt
p123
aVthat's locally sourced.
p124
aVAnd we need to be able to build this thing
p125
aVusing simple manufacturing techniques and factories
p126
aVthat don't cost us a fortune.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo about six years ago,
p129
aVI started thinking about this problem.
p130
aVAnd in order to adopt a fresh perspective,
p131
aVI sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.
p132
aVIn fact, I looked to a technology
p133
aVthat neither stores nor generates electricity,
p134
aVbut instead consumes electricity,
p135
aVhuge amounts of it.
p136
aVI'm talking about the production of aluminum.
p137
aVThe process was invented in 1886
p138
aVby a couple of 22-year-olds \u2014
p139
aVHall in the United States and Heroult in France.
p140
aVAnd just a few short years following their discovery,
p141
aValuminum changed
p142
aVfrom a precious metal costing as much as silver
p143
aVto a common structural material.
p144
aa(lp145
VYou're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
p146
aVIt's about 50 feet wide
p147
aVand recedes about half a mile \u2014
p148
aVrow after row of cells
p149
aVthat, inside, resemble Volta's battery,
p150
aVwith three important differences.
p151
aVVolta's battery works at room temperature.
p152
aVIt's fitted with solid electrodes
p153
aVand an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.
p154
aVThe Hall-Heroult cell
p155
aVoperates at high temperature,
p156
aVa temperature high enough
p157
aVthat the aluminum metal product is liquid.
p158
aVThe electrolyte
p159
aVis not a solution of salt and water,
p160
aVbut rather salt that's melted.
p161
aVIt's this combination of liquid metal,
p162
aVmolten salt and high temperature
p163
aVthat allows us to send high current through this thing.
p164
aVToday, we can produce virgin metal from ore
p165
aVat a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.
p166
aVThat's the economic miracle
p167
aVof modern electrometallurgy.
p168
aa(lp169
VIt is this that caught and held my attention
p170
aVto the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery
p171
aVthat could capture this gigantic economy of scale.
p172
aVAnd I did.
p173
aVI made the battery all liquid \u2014
p174
aVliquid metals for both electrodes
p175
aVand a molten salt for the electrolyte.
p176
aVI'll show you how.
p177
aVSo I put low-density
p178
aVliquid metal at the top,
p179
aVput a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,
p180
aVand molten salt in between.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo now,
p183
aVhow to choose the metals?
p184
aVFor me, the design exercise
p185
aValways begins here
p186
aVwith the periodic table,
p187
aVenunciated by another professor,
p188
aVDimitri Mendeleyev.
p189
aVEverything we know
p190
aVis made of some combination
p191
aVof what you see depicted here.
p192
aVAnd that includes our own bodies.
p193
aVI recall the very moment one day
p194
aVwhen I was searching for a pair of metals
p195
aVthat would meet the constraints
p196
aVof earth abundance,
p197
aVdifferent, opposite density
p198
aVand high mutual reactivity.
p199
aVI felt the thrill of realization
p200
aVwhen I knew I'd come upon the answer.
p201
aVMagnesium for the top layer.
p202
aVAnd antimony
p203
aVfor the bottom layer.
p204
aVYou know, I've got to tell you,
p205
aVone of the greatest benefits of being a professor:
p206
aVcolored chalk.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VSo to produce current,
p211
aVmagnesium loses two electrons
p212
aVto become magnesium ion,
p213
aVwhich then migrates across the electrolyte,
p214
aVaccepts two electrons from the antimony,
p215
aVand then mixes with it to form an alloy.
p216
aVThe electrons go to work
p217
aVin the real world out here,
p218
aVpowering our devices.
p219
aVNow to charge the battery,
p220
aVwe connect a source of electricity.
p221
aVIt could be something like a wind farm.
p222
aVAnd then we reverse the current.
p223
aVAnd this forces magnesium to de-alloy
p224
aVand return to the upper electrode,
p225
aVrestoring the initial constitution of the battery.
p226
aVAnd the current passing between the electrodes
p227
aVgenerates enough heat to keep it at temperature.
p228
aa(lp229
VIt's pretty cool,
p230
aVat least in theory.
p231
aVBut does it really work?
p232
aVSo what to do next?
p233
aVWe go to the laboratory.
p234
aVNow do I hire seasoned professionals?
p235
aVNo, I hire a student
p236
aVand mentor him,
p237
aVteach him how to think about the problem,
p238
aVto see it from my perspective
p239
aVand then turn him loose.
p240
aVThis is that student, David Bradwell,
p241
aVwho, in this image,
p242
aVappears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.
p243
aVWhat I didn't tell David at the time
p244
aVwas I myself wasn't convinced it would work.
p245
aa(lp246
VBut David's young and he's smart
p247
aVand he wants a Ph.D.,
p248
aVand he proceeds to build \u2014
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVHe proceeds to build
p251
aVthe first ever liquid metal battery
p252
aVof this chemistry.
p253
aVAnd based on David's initial promising results,
p254
aVwhich were paid
p255
aVwith seed funds at MIT,
p256
aVI was able to attract major research funding
p257
aVfrom the private sector
p258
aVand the federal government.
p259
aVAnd that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,
p260
aVa mix of graduate students, post-docs
p261
aVand even some undergraduates.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I was able to attract really, really good people,
p264
aVpeople who share my passion
p265
aVfor science and service to society,
p266
aVnot science and service for career building.
p267
aVAnd if you ask these people
p268
aVwhy they work on liquid metal battery,
p269
aVtheir answer would hearken back
p270
aVto President Kennedy's remarks
p271
aVat Rice University in 1962
p272
aVwhen he said \u2014 and I'm taking liberties here \u2014
p273
aV"We choose to work on grid-level storage,
p274
aVnot because it is easy,
p275
aVbut because it is hard."
p276
aa(lp277
V(Applause)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.
p280
aVWe start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
p281
aVI called it the shotglass.
p282
aVWe've operated over 400 of these,
p283
aVperfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries \u2014
p284
aVnot just magnesium and antimony.
p285
aVAlong the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.
p286
aVI call it the hockey puck.
p287
aVAnd we got the same remarkable results.
p288
aVAnd then it was onto the saucer.
p289
aVThat's 200 watt-hours.
p290
aVThe technology was proving itself
p291
aVto be robust and scalable.
p292
aVBut the pace wasn't fast enough for us.
p293
aVSo a year and a half ago,
p294
aVDavid and I,
p295
aValong with another research staff-member,
p296
aVformed a company
p297
aVto accelerate the rate of progress
p298
aVand the race to manufacture product.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo today at LMBC,
p301
aVwe're building cells 16 inches in diameter
p302
aVwith a capacity of one kilowatt-hour \u2014
p303
aV1,000 times the capacity
p304
aVof that initial shotglass cell.
p305
aVWe call that the pizza.
p306
aVAnd then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
p307
aVIt's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
p308
aVWe call that the bistro table,
p309
aVbut it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.
p310
aVAnd one variant of the technology
p311
aVhas us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,
p312
aVaggregating the modules into a giant battery
p313
aVthat fits in a 40-foot shipping container
p314
aVfor placement in the field.
p315
aVAnd this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours \u2014
p316
aVtwo million watt-hours.
p317
aVThat's enough energy
p318
aVto meet the daily electrical needs
p319
aVof 200 American households.
p320
aVSo here you have it, grid-level storage:
p321
aVsilent, emissions-free,
p322
aVno moving parts,
p323
aVremotely controlled,
p324
aVdesigned to the market price point
p325
aVwithout subsidy.
p326
aa(lp327
VSo what have we learned from all this?
p328
aV(Applause)
p329
aVSo what have we learned from all this?
p330
aVLet me share with you
p331
aVsome of the surprises, the heterodoxies.
p332
aVThey lie beyond the visible.
p333
aVTemperature:
p334
aVConventional wisdom says set it low,
p335
aVat or near room temperature,
p336
aVand then install a control system to keep it there.
p337
aVAvoid thermal runaway.
p338
aVLiquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature
p339
aVwith minimum regulation.
p340
aVOur battery can handle the very high temperature rises
p341
aVthat come from current surges.
p342
aVScaling: Conventional wisdom says
p343
aVreduce cost by producing many.
p344
aVLiquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost
p345
aVby producing fewer, but they'll be larger.
p346
aVAnd finally, human resources:
p347
aVConventional wisdom says
p348
aVhire battery experts,
p349
aVseasoned professionals,
p350
aVwho can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.
p351
aVTo develop liquid metal battery,
p352
aVI hired students and post-docs and mentored them.
p353
aVIn a battery,
p354
aVI strive to maximize electrical potential;
p355
aVwhen mentoring,
p356
aVI strive to maximize human potential.
p357
aVSo you see,
p358
aVthe liquid metal battery story
p359
aVis more than an account
p360
aVof inventing technology,
p361
aVit's a blueprint
p362
aVfor inventing inventors, full-spectrum.
