VOur ability to create and sustain economic growth
p4
aVis the defining challenge of our time.
p5
aa(lp6
VOf course there are other challenges \u2014
p7
aVhealth care, disease burdens and pandemics,
p8
aVenvironmental challenges
p9
aVand, of course, radicalized terrorism.
p10
aVHowever,
p11
aVto the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge,
p12
aVit will take us a long way
p13
aVto solving the challenges that I've just elucidated.
p14
aa(lp15
VMore importantly,
p16
aVunless and until we solve economic growth
p17
aVand create sustainable, long-term economic growth,
p18
aVwe'll be unable to address
p19
aVthe seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today,
p20
aVwhether it's health care, education or economic development.
p21
aa(lp22
VThe fundamental question is this:
p23
aVHow are we going to create economic growth
p24
aVin advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe
p25
aVat a time when they continue to struggle
p26
aVto create economic growth after the financial crisis?
p27
aa(lp28
VThey continue to underperform
p29
aVand to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth:
p30
aVcapital, labor and productivity.
p31
aVIn particular,
p32
aVthese developed economies continue to see debts and deficits,
p33
aVthe decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor
p34
aVand they also see productivity stalling.
p35
aa(lp36
VIn a similar vein,
p37
aVhow are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets,
p38
aVwhere 90 percent of the world's population lives
p39
aVand where, on average,
p40
aV70 percent of the population is under the age of 25?
p41
aVIn these countries,
p42
aVit is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year
p43
aVin order to put a dent in poverty
p44
aVand to double per capita incomes in one generation.
p45
aVAnd yet today,
p46
aVthe largest emerging economies \u2014
p47
aVcountries with at least 50 million people \u2014
p48
aVcontinue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark.
p49
aVWorse than that,
p50
aVcountries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China
p51
aVare falling below that seven percent number
p52
aVand, in many cases, actually regressing.
p53
aa(lp54
VEconomic growth matters.
p55
aVWith economic growth,
p56
aVcountries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle
p57
aVof upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards.
p58
aVWithout growth, countries contract and atrophy,
p59
aVnot just in the annals of economic statistics
p60
aVbut also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived.
p61
aVEconomic growth matters powerfully for the individual.
p62
aVIf growth wanes,
p63
aVthe risk to human progress
p64
aVand the risk of political and social instability rises,
p65
aVand societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe context matters.
p68
aVAnd countries in emerging markets
p69
aVdo not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition.
p72
aVThere are some people here
p73
aVwho will turn around and be quite disillusioned
p74
aVby what's happened around the world
p75
aVand basically ascribe that to economic growth.
p76
aVYou worry about the overpopulation of the planet.
p77
aVAnd looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections
p78
aVthat the world will have 11 billion people on the planet
p79
aVbefore it plateaus in 2100,
p80
aVyou're concerned about what that does to natural resources \u2014
p81
aVarable land, potable water, energy and minerals.
p82
aVYou are also concerned about the degradation of the environment.
p83
aVAnd you worry about how man,
p84
aVembodied in the corporate globalist,
p85
aVhas become greedy and corrupt.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut I'm here to tell you today that economic growth
p88
aVhas been the backbone of changes in living standards
p89
aVof millions of people around the world.
p90
aVAnd more importantly,
p91
aVit's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe definition of capitalism, very simply put,
p94
aVis that the factors of production,
p95
aVsuch as trade and industry, capital and labor,
p96
aVare left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's really essential here that we understand
p99
aVthat fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se
p100
aVbut what has happened to capitalism.
p101
aVAnd to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term,
p102
aVwe're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
p103
aa(lp104
VEconomic growth needs capitalism,
p105
aVbut it needs it to work properly.
p106
aVAnd as I mentioned a moment ago,
p107
aVthe core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors.
p108
aVAnd even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy.
p109
aVCapitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
p110
aVWhen in practical experience,
p111
aVcapitalism is much more of a spectrum.
p112
aVAnd we have countries such as China,
p113
aVwhich have practiced more state capitalism,
p114
aVand we have countries like the Unites States
p115
aVwhich are more market capitalist.
p116
aa(lp117
VOur efforts to critique the capitalist system, however,
p118
aVhave tended to focus on countries like China
p119
aVthat are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
p120
aa(lp121
VHowever, there is a real reason and real concern
p122
aVfor us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism,
p123
aVparticularly those embodied by the United States.
p124
aVThis is really important
p125
aVbecause this type of capitalism
p126
aVhas increasingly been afforded the critique
p127
aVthat it is now fostering corruption
p128
aVand, worse still,
p129
aVit's increasing income inequality \u2014
p130
aVthe idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe two really critical questions that we need to address
p133
aVis how can we fix capitalism
p134
aVso that it can help create economic growth
p135
aVbut at the same time can help to address social ills.
p136
aa(lp137
VIn order to think about that framing, we have to ask ourselves,
p138
aVhow does capitalism work today?
p139
aVVery simplistically,
p140
aVcapitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility maximizer \u2014
p141
aVa selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants.
p142
aVAnd only after they've maximized their utility
p143
aVdo they then decide it's important
p144
aVto provide support to other social contracts.
p145
aVOf course, in this system governments do tax,
p146
aVand they use part of their revenues to fund social programs,
p147
aVrecognizing that government's role is not just regulation
p148
aVbut also to be arbiter of social goods.
p149
aVBut nevertheless,
p150
aVthis framework \u2014
p151
aVthis two-stage framework \u2014
p152
aVis the basis from which we must now start
p153
aVto think about how we can improve the capitalist model.
p154
aa(lp155
VI would argue that there are two sides to this challenge.
p156
aVFirst of all,
p157
aVwe can draw on the right-wing policies
p158
aVto see what could be beneficial for us
p159
aVto think about how we can improve capitalism.
p160
aa(lp161
VIn particular,
p162
aVright-leaning policies
p163
aVhave tended to focus on things like conditional transfers,
p164
aVwhere we pay and reward people for doing the things
p165
aVthat we actually think can help enhance economic growth.
p166
aVFor example,
p167
aVsending children to school,
p168
aVparents could earn money for that,
p169
aVor getting their children inoculated or immunized,
p170
aVparents could get paid for doing that.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, quite apart from the debate
p173
aVon whether or not we should be paying people
p174
aVto do what we think they should do anyway,
p175
aVthe fact of the matter is that pay for performance
p176
aVhas actually yielded some positive results
p177
aVin places like Mexico,
p178
aVin Brazil
p179
aVand also in pilot programs in New York.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut there are also benefits
p182
aVand significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
p183
aVArguments that government should expand its role and responsibility
p184
aVso that it's not so narrowly defined
p185
aVand that government should be much more of an arbiter
p186
aVof the factors of production
p187
aVhave become commonplace with the success of China.
p188
aVBut also we've started to have debates
p189
aVabout how the role of the private sector
p190
aVshould move away from just being a profit motive
p191
aVand really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs.
p192
aVThings like the corporate social responsibility programs,
p193
aValbeit small in scale,
p194
aVare moving in that right direction.
p195
aVOf course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines
p196
aVbetween government, NGOs and private sector.
p197
aa(lp198
VTwo very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States,
p199
aVwhen the infrastructure rollout
p200
aVwas really about public-private partnerships.
p201
aVMore recently, of course,
p202
aVthe advent of the Internet has also proven to the world
p203
aVthat public and private can work together for the betterment of society.
p204
aa(lp205
VMy fundamental message to you is this:
p206
aVWe cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges
p207
aVby being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological.
p208
aVIn order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth
p209
aVand solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today,
p210
aVwe're going to have to be more broad-minded
p211
aVabout what might work.
p212
aa(lp213
VUltimately,
p214
aVwe have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth.
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VBruno Giussani: I want to ask a couple of questions, Dambisa,
p221
aVbecause one could react to your last sentence
p222
aVby saying growth is also an ideology,
p223
aVit's possibly the dominant ideology of our times.
p224
aVWhat do you say to those who react that way?
p225
aa(lp226
VDM: Well, I think that that's completely legitimate,
p227
aVand I think that we're already having that discussion.
p228
aVThere's a lot of work going on around happiness
p229
aVand other metrics being used for measuring people's success
p230
aVand improvements in living standards.
p231
aVAnd so I think that we should be open
p232
aVto what could deliver improvements in people's living standards
p233
aVand continue to reduce poverty around the world.
p234
aa(lp235
VBG: So you're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth,
p236
aVbut the only way for that happen
p237
aVwithout compromising the capacity of the earth,
p238
aVto take us on a long journey,
p239
aVis for economic growth
p240
aVsomehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources.
p241
aVDo you see that happening?
p242
aa(lp243
VDM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity.
p244
aVI think if we start to constrain ourselves
p245
aVusing the finite, scarce and depleting resources
p246
aVthat we know today,
p247
aVwe could get quite negative
p248
aVand quite concerned about the way the world is.
p249
aa(lp250
VHowever, we've seen the Club of Rome,
p251
aVwe've seen previous claims
p252
aVthat the world would be running out of resources,
p253
aVand it's not to argue that those things are not valid.
p254
aVBut I think, with ingenuity we could see desalination,
p255
aVI think we could reinvest in energy,
p256
aVso that we can actually get better outcomes.
p257
aVAnd so in that sense,
p258
aVI'm much more optimistic about what humans can do.
p259
aa(lp260
VBG: The thing that strikes me
p261
aVabout your proposals for rehabilitating growth
p262
aVand taking a different direction
p263
aVis that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism \u2014
p264
aVwith putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive
p265
aVor developing a bigger role for business in social issues.
p266
aVIs that what you're suggesting?
p267
aa(lp268
VDM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.
p269
aVI think it is absolutely the case
p270
aVthat traditional models of economic growth
p271
aVare not working the way we would like them to.
p272
aVAnd I think it's no accident
p273
aVthat today the largest economy in the world, the United States,
p274
aVhas democracy,
p275
aVliberal democracy, as it's core political stance
p276
aVand it has free market capitalism \u2014
p277
aVto the extent that it is free \u2014
p278
aVfree market capitalism as its economic stance.
p279
aVThe second largest economy is China.
p280
aVIt has deprioritized democracy
p281
aVand it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model.
p282
aVThese two countries, completely different political models
p283
aVand completely different economic models,
p284
aVand yet they have the same income inequality number
p285
aVmeasured as a Gini coefficient.
p286
aa(lp287
VI think those are the debates we should have,
p288
aVbecause it's not clear at all
p289
aVwhat model we should be adopting,
p290
aVand I think there needs to be much more discourse
p291
aVand much more humility about what we know and what we don't know.
p292
aa(lp293
VBG: One last question. The COP21 is going on in Paris.
p294
aVIf you could send a tweet
p295
aVto all the heads of state and heads of delegations there,
p296
aVwhat would you say?
p297
aa(lp298
VDM: Again, I would be very much about being open-minded.
p299
aVAs you're aware,
p300
aVthe issues around the environmental concerns
p301
aVhave been on the agenda many times now \u2014
p302
aVin Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm \u2014
p303
aVand we keep revisiting these issues
p304
aVpartly because there is not a fundamental agreement,
p305
aVin fact there's a schism
p306
aVbetween what the developed countries believe and want
p307
aVand what emerging market countries want.
p308
aVEmerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth
p309
aVso that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries.
p310
aVDeveloped countries recognize
p311
aVthat they have a real, important responsibility
p312
aVnot only just to manage their CO2 emissions
p313
aVand some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world,
p314
aVbut also as trendsetters in R&D.
p315
aVAnd so they have to come to the table as well.
p316
aVBut in essence, it cannot be a situation
p317
aVwhere we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets
p318
aVwithout developed countries themselves
p319
aValso taking quite a swipe at what they're doing
p320
aVboth in demand and supply in developed markets.
p321
aa(lp322
