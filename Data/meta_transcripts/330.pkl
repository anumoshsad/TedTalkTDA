VSo what's image got do with it?
p4
aVAnd I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send
p5
aVa lot of subliminal messages,
p6
aVbecause I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
p7
aVthat have come up.
p8
aVBut I'm going to try and do something different,
p9
aVand try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,
p10
aVand try and put a face to a lot of the issues
p11
aVthat we've been talking about.
p12
aVSo, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,
p13
aVas you can see.
p14
aVWe're not the only ones.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd you know, it's amazing.
p21
aVI mean, we need a whole conference
p22
aVjust devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
p23
aVJust think about that, you know?
p24
aVAnd this is typically what we've been talking about,
p25
aVthe role that the media plays in focusing
p26
aVjust on the negative stuff.
p27
aVNow, why is that a problem?
p28
aVA typical disaster story:
p29
aVdisease, corruption, poverty.
p30
aVAnd some of you might be standing here thinking,
p31
aVsaying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,
p32
aVand all you privileged people come here, saying,
p33
aV'Forget the poor people.
p34
aVLet's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "
p35
aVAnd they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans
p36
aVwho really need help."
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?
p39
aVAnd it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
p40
aVWe start with poverty.
p41
aVI didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,
p42
aVbut I know what it is to grow up without having money,
p43
aVor being able to support family.
p44
aVEuvin was talking about bellwether signs.
p45
aVThe bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
p46
aVYou know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
p47
aVWhen things were bad, we had porridge.
p48
aVAnd like many African families,
p49
aVmy parents could never save
p50
aVbecause they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,
p51
aVand things were always dicey.
p52
aVNow, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,
p53
aVand they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,
p54
aVwhich was free.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd they adopted a very interesting
p57
aVapproach to education, which was
p58
aVthey were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
p59
aVSo they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,
p60
aVwhich set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
p61
aVAnd what happened was,
p62
aVbecause they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,
p63
aVI got kicked out pretty much every term.
p64
aVYou know, someone would come in with a list
p65
aVof the people who haven't paid school fees,
p66
aVand when they started getting pretty strict,
p67
aVyou had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
p68
aVAnd I remember thinking, I mean,
p69
aVwhy don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
p70
aVBecause you know, as a kid
p71
aVyou're embarrassed and
p72
aVyou're sensitive, and everyone knows
p73
aVyou guys don't have money.
p74
aVBut they kept at it,
p75
aVand I now understand why they did what they did.
p76
aa(lp77
VThey talk about corruption.
p78
aVIn Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
p79
aVAnd there's national schools, which are like the best schools,
p80
aVand provincial schools.
p81
aVMy dream school at that time was Kenya High School,
p82
aVa national school.
p83
aVI missed the cutoff by one point.
p84
aVAnd I was so disappointed, and I was like,
p85
aV"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
p86
aVAnd my father said, "OK, listen.
p87
aVLet's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
p88
aVYou know, it's just one point. I mean,
p89
aVmaybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
p90
aVSo we went to the school,
p91
aVand because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,
p92
aVand because my father didn't have the right last name,
p93
aVhe was treated like dirt.
p94
aVAnd I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,
p95
aVyou know, who do you think you are?
p96
aVAnd, you know, you must be joking if you think
p97
aVyou can get a slot.
p98
aVAnd I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,
p99
aVand who had done much, much worse than I did,
p100
aVand they had slots there.
p101
aVAnd there's nothing worse than seeing your parent
p102
aVbeing humiliated in front of you, you know?
p103
aVAnd we left, and I swore to myself,
p104
aVand I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have
p105
aVto beg for anything in my life."
p106
aVThey called me two weeks later, they're like,
p107
aVoh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
VFinal story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.
p112
aVDisease.
p113
aVMy father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
p114
aVHe never told anyone that he had AIDS,
p115
aVhis fear of the stigma was so strong.
p116
aVAnd I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
p117
aVAnd I was in the States at the time,
p118
aVand they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
p119
aVAnd he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
p120
aVAnd so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
p121
aVBecause of doctor-patient privilege,
p122
aVthey couldn't really tell us what was going on.
p123
aVBut they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
p124
aVAnd when I went online and looked at the infectious \u2014
p125
aVread about the disease,
p126
aVI pretty much realized what was going on.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe first time he got sick, he recovered.
p129
aVBut what happened was that he had to be on medication
p130
aVthat, at that time \u2014 Diflucan, which in the States
p131
aVis used for yeast infections \u2014 cost 30 dollars a pill.
p132
aVHe had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
p133
aVYou know, so money ran out.
p134
aVHe got sick again.
p135
aVAnd up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,
p136
aVand he used to import, bring him, could
p137
aVget him a generic version of it.
p138
aVAnd that kept him going.
p139
aVBut the money ran out.
p140
aVHe got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
p141
aVAt that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,
p142
aVand we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash
p143
aVfor him to start the treatment until Monday.
p144
aVThe hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
p145
aVAnd finally, we figured, well, OK,
p146
aVwe'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
p147
aVAt least he'll get treated
p148
aVwhile we try to figure out the money situation.
p149
aVAnd he died when the ambulance was coming
p150
aVto the hospital to take him.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd, you know, now, imagine if \u2014 and I could go on and on \u2014
p153
aVimagine if this is all you know about me.
p154
aVHow would you look at me?
p155
aVWith pity, you know. Sadness.
p156
aVAnd this is how you look at Africa.
p157
aVThis is the damage it causes.
p158
aVYou don't see the other side of me.
p159
aVYou don't see the blogger,
p160
aVyou don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,
p161
aVthe vibrant person, you know?
p162
aVAnd I just wanted to personalize that.
p163
aVBecause we talk about it in big terms,
p164
aVand you wonder, you know, so what?
p165
aVBut it's damaging.
p166
aVAnd I'm not unique, right?
p167
aVImagine if all you knew about William
p168
aVwas the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
p169
aVAnd you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
p170
aVAnd I was just moved.
p171
aVI was actually crying during his presentation.
p172
aVHe was like, I try and I make.
p173
aVI was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.
p178
aVWhen you focus just on the disasters \u2014
p179
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p180
aV\u2014 we're ignoring the potential.
p181
aVSo, what is to be done?
p182
aVFirst of all,
p183
aVAfricans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
p184
aVWe heard about that yesterday.
p185
aVWe had some of them this morning.
p186
aVAnd this is an example, you know,
p187
aVblogging is one way of doing that.
p188
aVAfrigator is an aggregator of African blogs
p189
aVthat was developed in South Africa.
p190
aVSo we need to start getting better.
p191
aVIf no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
p192
aVAnd going back to the point I was trying to make,
p193
aVthis is the Swahili Wikipedia.
p194
aVSwahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
p195
aVIt only has five contributors.
p196
aVFour of them are white males \u2014 non-native speakers.
p197
aVThe other person is \u2014 Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up \u2014
p198
aVis a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
p199
aVHe's the only African who's contributing to this.
p200
aa(lp201
VPeople, please. We can't whine and complain
p202
aVthe West is doing this.
p203
aVWhat are we doing?
p204
aVWhere are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
p205
aVWhy are we not generating our own content?
p206
aVYou know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
p207
aVReuters now integrates African blogs
p208
aVinto their coverage of Africa.
p209
aVSo, that's a start,
p210
aVand we've heard of all their other initiatives.
p211
aVThe cheetah generation.
p212
aVThe aid approach, you know, is flawed.
p213
aVAnd after all the hoopla of Live 8,
p214
aVwe're still not anywhere in the picture.
p215
aVNo, you're not.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VBut the point I'm trying to make, though,
p220
aVis that it's not enough for us to criticize.
p221
aVAnd for those of you in the diaspora
p222
aVwho are struggling with where should I be,
p223
aVshould I move back,
p224
aVshould I stay?
p225
aVYou know, just jump.
p226
aVThe continent needs you.
p227
aVAnd I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
p228
aVI walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,
p229
aVCovington and Burling, six figures.
p230
aVWith two paychecks, or three paychecks,
p231
aVI could solve a lot of my family's problems.
p232
aVBut I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
p233
aVand because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
p234
aVAnd because I'm needed here, you know?
p235
aVI probably can win a prize for the most ways
p236
aVto use a Harvard Law School degree
p237
aVbecause of all the things I'm doing.
p238
aa(lp239
VOne is because I'm pretty aggressive,
p240
aVand I try and find, you know, opportunities.
p241
aVBut there is such a need, you know?
p242
aVI'm a corporate lawyer most of the time
p243
aVfor an organization called Enablis
p244
aVthat supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
p245
aVWe're now moving into East Africa.
p246
aVAnd we give them business development services,
p247
aVas well as financing loan and equity.
p248
aVI've also set up a project in Kenya,
p249
aVand what we do is we track the performance
p250
aVof Kenyan MPs.
p251
aVMy partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
p252
aVIt costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
p253
aVEverything else on there is a labor of love.
p254
aVWe've manually entered all the data there.
p255
aVAnd you can get profiles of each MP,
p256
aVquestions they've asked in parliament.
p257
aVWe have a comment function,
p258
aVwhere people can ask their MPs questions.
p259
aVThere are some MPs who participate,
p260
aVand come back and ask.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd basically, we started this because we were tired
p263
aVof complaining about our politicians.
p264
aVYou know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
p265
aVYou're not just going to be accountable
p266
aVout of the goodness of your heart.
p267
aVAnd we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
p268
aVWhat are they doing?
p269
aVYou know, they're not going to change
p270
aVjust out of nowhere.
p271
aVSo we need new policies, we need \u2014
p272
aVwhere's that coming from, you know?
p273
aVAnother thing is that these leaders
p274
aVare a reflection of our society.
p275
aVWe talk about African governments
p276
aVlike they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
p277
aVThey come from us.
p278
aVAnd what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
p279
aVAnd how can we change that?
p280
aVSo Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start
p281
aVinspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
p282
aVWhere do we go from here?
p283
aVI believe in the power of ideas.
p284
aVI believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,
p287
aVand keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,
p288
aVbecause it can make a difference.
p289
aVThe other thing I want to urge you to do
p290
aVis take an interest in the individual.
p291
aVI've had lots of conversations about things I think
p292
aVneed to be happening in Africa.
p293
aVPeople are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,
p294
aVI'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
p295
aVAnd when I talk about my ideas, they're like,
p296
aV"BBut it's not scalable, you know.
p297
aVGive me something I can do with Paypal."
p298
aVIt's not that easy, you know?
p299
aVAnd sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,
p300
aVin the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,
p301
aVit can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,
p302
aVbecause usually the individual in Africa
p303
aVcarries a lot of people behind them.
p304
aVPractically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,
p305
aVmy mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
p306
aVMy sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
p307
aVI was helping her pay her tuition.
p308
aVMy cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
p309
aVI was paying her school fees.
p310
aa(lp311
VA cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,
p312
aVso we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
p313
aVYou know, she's now my baby sister.
p314
aVAnd because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,
p315
aVI am able to lift all those people.
p316
aVSo, don't underestimate that.
p317
aVAn example. This man changed my life.
p318
aVHe's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
p319
aVHe's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
p320
aVAnd because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,
p321
aVbecause he took an interest.
p322
aVI was taking a class of his, and he was just like,
p323
aVthis is an overeager student,
p324
aVwhich we don't normally get in the United States,
p325
aVbecause everyone else is cynical and jaded.
p326
aVHe called me to his office and said,
p327
aV"What do you want to do when you grow up?"
p328
aVI said, "I want to be a lawyer."
p329
aVAnd he was like, "Why? You know,
p330
aVwe don't need another lawyer in the United States."
p331
aVAnd he tried to talk me out of it,
p332
aVbut it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,
p333
aVI'm poli-sci Ph.D.
p334
aVBut, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,
p335
aVwhat I need to do to help you out."
p336
aa(lp337
VIt was like, "Where do you want to go?"
p338
aVAnd to me at that time university \u2014
p339
aVI was at University of Pitts for undergrad,
p340
aVand that was like heaven, OK,
p341
aVbecause compared to what could have been in Kenya.
p342
aVSo I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
p343
aVHe was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,
p344
aVyou have all these things going for you."
p345
aVAnd I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,
p346
aVand you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
p347
aVLike, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard
p348
aVfor applying to law school.
p349
aVAnd, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
p350
aVAnd he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,
p351
aVyou're that good, OK?
p352
aVAnd if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
p353
aVAnd he built me up, you know?
p354
aVAnd this is just an illustration.
p355
aa(lp356
VYou can meet other individuals here.
p357
aVWe just need a push.
p358
aVThat's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
p359
aVBasically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
p360
aVA gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity
p361
aVof us having to leave the continent
p362
aVso that we can fulfill our potential.
p363
aVYou know, my vision is that my daughter,
p364
aVand any other African child being born today,
p365
aVcan be whoever they want to be here,
p366
aVwithout having to leave.
p367
aVAnd they can have the possibility of transcending
p368
aVthe circumstances under which they were born.
p369
aVThat's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
p370
aVThat you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,
p371
aVand you can move.
p372
aVJust because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,
p373
aVthat doesn't define who you are.
p374
aVFor most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,
p375
aVand the circumstances under which you were born,
p376
aVdetermine the rest of your life.
p377
aVI would like to see that change,
p378
aVand the change starts with us.
p379
aVAnd as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
p380
aVThank you.
