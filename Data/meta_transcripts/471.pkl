VThis is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs
p4
aVI'm going to show you today.
p5
aVIt was taken 18 years ago.
p6
aVI was 19 years old at the time.
p7
aVI had just returned
p8
aVfrom one of the deepest dives I'd ever made at that time \u2014
p9
aVa little over 200 feet.
p10
aVAnd I had caught this little fish.
p11
aVIt turns out that particular one was the first of its kind
p12
aVever taken alive.
p13
aVI'm not just an ichthyologist, I'm a bona fide fish nerd.
p14
aVAnd to a fish nerd, this is some pretty exciting stuff.
p15
aVMore exciting was the fact that the person who took this photo
p16
aVis a guy named Jack Randall,
p17
aVthe greatest living ichthyologist on earth \u2014
p18
aVthe Grand Poobah of fish nerds, if you will.
p19
aVAnd so, it was really exciting to me to have this moment in time.
p20
aVIt set the course for the rest of my life.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut really, the most significant, most profound thing about this picture
p23
aVis it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed
p24
aVfrom the neck down.
p25
aVI made a really stupid kind of mistake
p26
aVthat most 19-year-old males do when they think they're immortal,
p27
aVand I got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed,
p28
aVand had to be flown back for treatment.
p29
aVI learned two really important things that day.
p30
aVThe first thing I learned \u2014 well, I'm mortal. That's a really big one.
p31
aVAnd the second thing I learned was that I knew, with profound certainty,
p32
aVthat this is exactly what I was going to do for the rest of my life.
p33
aVI had to focus all my energies
p34
aVtowards going to find new species of things
p35
aVdown on deep coral reefs.
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of:
p38
aVthese big, hard, elaborate corals,
p39
aVlots of bright, colorful fishes and things.
p40
aVBut this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
p41
aVIf you look at this diagram of a coral reef,
p42
aVwe know a lot about that part up near the top.
p43
aVThe reason we know so much about it
p44
aVis scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.
p45
aa(lp46
VThere is a problem with scuba, though,
p47
aVin that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go.
p48
aVIt turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
p49
aVI'll get into why that is in just a minute,
p50
aVbut the point is, scuba divers generally stay less than 100 feet deep,
p51
aVand very rarely go much below this, at least, not with any kind of sanity.
p52
aVSo to go deeper, most biologists have turned to submersibles.
p53
aVNow, submersibles are great, wonderful things,
p54
aVbut if you're going to spend 30,000 dollars a day to use one of these things
p55
aVand it's capable of going 2,000 feet,
p56
aVyou're not going to go farting around up here in a couple of hundred feet,
p57
aVyou're going to go way down deep.
p58
aVSo the bottom line is, almost all research using submersibles
p59
aVhas taken place well below 500 feet.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, it's pretty obvious at this point
p62
aVthere's a zone here in the middle.
p63
aVThat's the zone
p64
aVthat centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness.
p65
aVI want to find out what's in this zone; we know almost nothing about it.
p66
aVScuba divers can't get there, submarines go right on past it.
p67
aa(lp68
VIt took me a year to learn to walk again after my diving accident in Palau.
p69
aVDuring that year,
p70
aVI spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving
p71
aVand how to overcome these limitations.
p72
aVI'm just going to show you a basic idea.
p73
aVWe're all breathing air right now.
p74
aVAir is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,
p75
aV20 percent oxygen, 80 percent nitrogen.
p76
aVIt's in our lungs.
p77
aVAnd there's a phenomenon called Henry's law,
p78
aVthat says gases will dissolve into a fluid
p79
aVin proportion to the partial pressures you're exposing them to.
p80
aVSo, basically the gas dissolves into our body.
p81
aVThe oxygen is bound by metabolism, we use it for energy.
p82
aVThe nitrogen sort of floats around in our blood and tissues.
p83
aVThat's fine, it's how we're designed.
p84
aVThe problem happens when you go underwater.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe deeper you go underwater, the higher the pressure is.
p87
aVIf you were to go down to a depth of about 130 feet,
p88
aVwhich is the recommended limit for most scuba divers,
p89
aVyou'd get this pressure effect.
p90
aVThe effect of that pressure is you have an increased density of gas molecules
p91
aVin every breath you take.
p92
aVOver time, those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues
p93
aVand start to fill you up.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, if you were to go down to, say, 300 feet,
p96
aVyou don't have five times as many gas molecules in your lungs,
p97
aVyou've got 10 times as many gas molecules in your lungs.
p98
aVAnd, sure enough, they dissolve into your blood and tissues as well.
p99
aVAnd if you were to go down to where there's 15 times as much \u2014
p100
aVthe deeper you go, the more exacerbating the problem becomes.
p101
aVThe limitation of diving with air is all those dots in your body,
p102
aVall the nitrogen and all the oxygen.
p103
aa(lp104
VThere are three basic limitations of scuba diving.
p105
aVThe first limitation is the oxygen \u2014
p106
aVoxygen toxicity.
p107
aVNow, we all know the song: "Love is like oxygen.
p108
aVYou get too much, you get too high. Not enough, and you're gonna die."
p109
aVWell, in the context of diving, you get too much, you die also.
p110
aVYou die because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure.
p111
aVIt makes you convulse underwater \u2014 not a good thing to happen underwater.
p112
aVIt happens because there's too much concentration of oxygen in your body.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe nitrogen has two problems.
p115
aVOne of them is what Jacques Cousteau called "rapture of the deep."
p116
aVIt's nitrogen narcosis.
p117
aVIt makes you loopy; the deeper you go, the loopier you get.
p118
aVYou don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk.
p119
aVSo that's a real big problem.
p120
aVAnd of course, the third problem
p121
aVis the one I found out the hard way in Palau,
p122
aVwhich is the bends.
p123
aa(lp124
VOne thing I forgot to mention
p125
aVis that to obviate the problem of nitrogen narcosis \u2014
p126
aVall of those blue dots in our body \u2014
p127
aVyou remove the nitrogen and replace it with helium.
p128
aVHelium's a gas; there're a lot of reasons why helium's good,
p129
aVit's a tiny molecule, it's inert, it doesn't give you narcosis.
p130
aVSo that's the basic concept we use.
p131
aVBut the theory's relatively easy.
p132
aVThe tricky part is the implementation.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo this is how I began about 15 years ago.
p135
aVI'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts,
p136
aVbut you've got to start somewhere.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VAt the time, I wasn't the only one who didn't know what I was doing.
p141
aVAlmost nobody did.
p142
aVThis rig was actually used for a dive of 300 feet.
p143
aVBut over time we got better at it,
p144
aVand we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig
p145
aVwith four scuba tanks, five regulators and all the right gas mixtures,
p146
aVall that good stuff.
p147
aVIt was fine and dandy, it allowed us to go down and find new species.
p148
aa(lp149
VThis picture was taken at 300 feet, catching new species of fish.
p150
aVThe problem was it didn't allow us much time.
p151
aVFor all its bulk and size, it only gave us about 15 minutes at most
p152
aVdown at those sorts of depths.
p153
aVWe needed more time. There had to be a better way.
p154
aVAnd indeed, there is a better way.
p155
aa(lp156
VIn 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access
p157
aVto these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
p158
aVClosed-circuit rebreather: what makes it different from scuba,
p159
aVand why is it better?
p160
aVWell, there are three main advantages to a rebreather.
p161
aVOne, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.
p162
aVTwo, they allow you to stay underwater longer.
p163
aVThree, they allow you to go deeper.
p164
aVHow is it that they do that?
p165
aVIn order to really understand how they do that,
p166
aVyou have to look underneath the hood and see what's going on.
p167
aa(lp168
VThere are three basic systems to a closed-circuit rebreather.
p169
aVThe most fundamental is called the breathing loop.
p170
aVIt's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it;
p171
aVit's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around.
p172
aVThere's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth,
p173
aVand there's a counter lung, or in this case, two counter lungs.
p174
aVThe counter lungs aren't high tech, they're simply flexible bags.
p175
aVThey allow you to mechanically breathe, mechanically ventilate.
p176
aVWhen you exhale, it goes in the exhale counter lung;
p177
aVwhen you inhale, it comes from the inhale counter lung.
p178
aVIt's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop.
p179
aa(lp180
VThe other component on a breathing loop is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.
p181
aVNow, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide,
p182
aVand that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.
p183
aVThere's a chemical filter in there
p184
aVthat pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas,
p185
aVso that when it comes back to us, it's safe to breathe again.
p186
aVThat's the breathing loop in a nutshell.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe second main component of a closed-circuit rebreather
p189
aVis the gas system.
p190
aVThe primary purpose of the gas system is to provide oxygen,
p191
aVto replenish the oxygen that your body consumes.
p192
aVSo the main tank, the main critical thing,
p193
aVis this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here.
p194
aVBut if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder,
p195
aVwe wouldn't be able to go very deep,
p196
aVbecause we'd run into oxygen toxicity very quickly.
p197
aVSo we need another gas, something to dilute the oxygen with.
p198
aVAnd that, fittingly enough, is called the diluent gas supply.
p199
aVIn our applications, we generally put air inside this diluent gas supply,
p200
aVbecause it's a very cheap and easy source of nitrogen.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo that's where we get our nitrogen from.
p203
aVBut if we want to go deeper, of course, we need another gas supply,
p204
aVand helium is what we really need to go deep.
p205
aVUsually we'll have a slightly larger cylinder,
p206
aVmounted exterior on the rebreather, like this.
p207
aVThat's what we use to inject, as we start to do our deep dives.
p208
aVWe also have a second oxygen cylinder, solely as a backup;
p209
aVif there's a problem with our first oxygen supply,
p210
aVwe can continue to breathe.
p211
aVThe way you manage all these different gases and different gas supplies
p212
aVis this really high-tech, sophisticated gas block up on the front here,
p213
aVwhere it's easy to reach.
p214
aVIt's got the valves and knobs and things you need
p215
aVto inject the right gases at the right time.
p216
aa(lp217
VNormally, you don't have to do that,
p218
aVbecause all of it's done automatically
p219
aVwith the electronics, the third system of a rebreather.
p220
aVThe most critical part of a rebreather are the oxygen sensors.
p221
aVYou need three, so if one goes bad, you know which one it is.
p222
aVYou need voting logic.
p223
aVYou also have three microprocessors.
p224
aVAny one of those computers can run the entire system,
p225
aVso if you have to lose two of them,
p226
aVthere's back-up power supplies.
p227
aVAnd there are multiple displays, to get the information to the diver.
p228
aVThis is the high-tech gadgetry that allows us to do what we do
p229
aVon these deep dives.
p230
aVI can talk about it all day \u2014 just ask my wife \u2014
p231
aVbut I want to move on to something much more interesting.
p232
aa(lp233
VI'm going to take you on a deep dive,
p234
aVand show you what it's like to do one.
p235
aVWe start up on the boat,
p236
aVFor all this high-tech, expensive equipment,
p237
aVthis is still the best way to get in the water,
p238
aVjust flop over the side of the boat.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, as I showed you in the earlier diagram,
p241
aVthese reefs that we dive on start out near the surface
p242
aVand they go almost vertically, completely straight down.
p243
aVSo we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff,
p244
aVand then we start dropping, dropping, dropping.
p245
aVPeople ask if it takes a long time to get there.
p246
aVNo; it only takes a couple minutes to get down to three or four hundred feet,
p247
aVwhich is what we're aiming for.
p248
aVIt's like skydiving in slow motion. It's really very interesting.
p249
aVYou ever see "The Abyss,"
p250
aVwhere Ed Harris is sinking down along the side of the wall?
p251
aVThat's what it feels like. Amazing.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd down there, you find that the water is very clear, extremely clear,
p254
aVbecause there's hardly any plankton.
p255
aVWhen you turn on your light and look around the caves,
p256
aVyou're confronted with a tremendous amount of diversity,
p257
aVmuch more than anyone used to believe.
p258
aVNow, not all of it is new species \u2014
p259
aVthat fish you see with the white stripe, that's a known species.
p260
aVBut if you look carefully into the cracks and crevices,
p261
aVyou'll see little things scurrying all over the place.
p262
aVThere's a just unbelievable diversity.
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's not just fish, either.
p265
aVThese are crinoids, sponges, black corals. There're some more fishes.
p266
aVThose fishes that you see now are new species.
p267
aVThey're still new species,
p268
aVbecause I had a video camera instead of my net,
p269
aVso they're still waiting down there for someone to go find them.
p270
aVBut this is what it looks like.
p271
aVAnd this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.
p272
aVThis is Papua, New Guinea.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow little fishes and invertebrates aren't the only things we see down there.
p275
aVWe also see sharks,
p276
aVmuch more regularly than I would have expected to.
p277
aVWe're not quite sure why.
p278
aVWhat I want you to do now is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,
p279
aVwith all this high-tech gear on your back,
p280
aVyou're in a remote reef off Papua, New Guinea,
p281
aVthousands of miles from the nearest recompression chamber,
p282
aVand you're completely surrounded by sharks.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice) Look at those ...
p285
aa(lp286
VDiver 2: Uh, oh ...
p287
aVUh, oh!
p288
aa(lp289
VAudience: (Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
V(Video) Diver 1: I think we have their attention ...
p292
aa(lp293
VRichard Pyle: When you start talking like Donald Duck,
p294
aVthere's no situation in the world that can seem tense.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VSo we're down there \u2014 this is at 400 feet.
p299
aVThat's looking straight up, by the way, to give a sense of how far the surface is.
p300
aVAnd if you're a biologist and know about sharks,
p301
aVand you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here,
p302
aVthere's one question that sort of jumps to the forefront of your mind immediately,
p303
aVwhich is \u2014
p304
aa(lp305
V(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?
p306
aa(lp307
VDiver 2: Silvertip sharks.
p308
aa(lp309
VDiver 1: Oh.
p310
aa(lp311
VRP: There are actually three species of sharks here.
p312
aVThe silvertips are the ones with the white edges on the fins,
p313
aVand there're also gray reef sharks and hammerheads off in the distance.
p314
aVAnd yes, it's a little nerve-racking.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!
p317
aVThat little guy is frisky!
p318
aa(lp319
VAudience: (Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VNow, you've seen video like this on TV a lot, and it's very intimidating.
p322
aVI think it gives the wrong impression about sharks;
p323
aVthey're actually not very dangerous animals.
p324
aVThat's why we weren't worried much and were joking around.
p325
aVMore people are killed by pigs, by lightning strikes,
p326
aVmore people are killed at soccer games in England.
p327
aVThere's a lot of other ways you can die.
p328
aVAnd I'm not making that stuff up.
p329
aVCoconuts! You can get killed by a coconut more likely than killed by a shark.
p330
aVSo sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow, I don't know if any of you get US News and World Report \u2014
p333
aVI got the recent issue.
p334
aVThere's a cover story about the great explorers of our time.
p335
aVThe last article is entitled, "No New Frontiers."
p336
aVIt questions whether or not there really are any new frontiers out there,
p337
aVwhether there are any true, hardcore discoveries that can still be made.
p338
aVMy favorite line from the article:
p339
aV[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy with an extra spine in its dorsal fin."]
p340
aVI have to laugh; they don't call us fish nerds for nothing.
p341
aVWe actually do get excited about finding a new dorsal spine in a guppy.
p342
aVBut it's much more than that.
p343
aVI want to show you a few of the guppies we've found over the years.
p344
aa(lp345
VThis one \u2014 you can see how ugly it is.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Laughter)
p348
aa(lp349
VEven if you ignore the scientific value of this thing,
p350
aVlook at the monetary value of this thing.
p351
aVA couple of these were sold through the aquarium trade to Japan,
p352
aVwhere they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.
p353
aVThat's half a million dollars a pound.
p354
aa(lp355
VHere's another new angelfish we discovered.
p356
aVThis one we first discovered back in the air days \u2014 the bad old air days,
p357
aVwhen we were doing these kind of dives with air.
p358
aVWe were at 360 feet.
p359
aVI remember coming up from one of these deep dives and I had this fog,
p360
aVand the narcosis takes a little while to fade away, sort of like sobering up.
p361
aVI had this vague recollection of seeing this yellow fish with a black spot,
p362
aVand thought, "Damn, I should have caught one \u2014
p363
aVI think that's a new species."
p364
aVEventually, I looked in my bucket.
p365
aVSure enough, I had caught one, I just completely forgot.
p366
aVSo this one, we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to.
p367
aVThat's its official scientific name,
p368
aVin reference to its deep-dwelling habits.
p369
aa(lp370
VThis is another neat one.
p371
aVWhen we first found it,
p372
aVwe weren't even sure what family it belonged to,
p373
aVso we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,
p374
aVsince it looked like something from one of those books.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, this one's pretty cool.
p377
aVIf you go to Papua, New Guinea and go down 300 feet,
p378
aVyou'll see these big mounds.
p379
aVThis may be hard to see, but they're a couple meters in diameter.
p380
aVIf you look closely, you'll see there's a little white and gray fish
p381
aVthat hangs out near them.
p382
aVIt turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds,
p383
aVone pebble at a time.
p384
aVIt's extraordinary to find something like this.
p385
aVIt's not just new species, it's new behaviors, new ecology,
p386
aVall kind of new things.
p387
aa(lp388
VWhat I'm going to show you now, quickly,
p389
aVis a sampling of the new species we've discovered.
p390
aVWhat's extraordinary is not just the number of species we're finding \u2014
p391
aVthough as you can see, that's pretty amazing;
p392
aVthis is only half of what we've found \u2014
p393
aVwhat's extraordinary is how quickly we find them.
p394
aVWe're up to seven new species per hour of time we spend at that depth.
p395
aVIf you go to an Amazon jungle and fog a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,
p396
aVbut for fishes, there's nowhere in the world
p397
aVyou can get seven new species per hour of time.
p398
aa(lp399
VNow, we've done some back-of-the-envelope calculations,
p400
aVand we're predicting there are probably about 2,000 to 2,500 new species
p401
aVin the Indo-Pacific alone.
p402
aVThere are only five to six thousand known species,
p403
aVso a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known.
p404
aVWe thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity \u2014 evidently not.
p405
aa(lp406
VI'm going to just close on a very somber note.
p407
aVAt the beginning, I said I'd show you two extraordinary photographs.
p408
aVThis is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you.
p409
aVThis one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks.
p410
aVThis was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
p411
aVThe reason this photograph is extraordinary
p412
aVis because it captures a moment
p413
aVin the very last minute of a person's life.
p414
aVLess than 60 seconds after this picture was taken, this guy was dead.
p415
aVWhen we recovered his body, we figured out what had gone wrong.
p416
aVHe had made a very simple mistake;
p417
aVhe turned the wrong valve when he filled his cylinder.
p418
aVhe had 80 percent oxygen in his tank when he should have had 40.
p419
aVHe had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.

VThe reason I show this \u2014 not to put a downer on everything \u2014
p422
aVbut I just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general,
p423
aVwhich is that we all have two goals.
p424
aVThe first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet,
p425
aVwhich is to survive.
p426
aVI call it perpetuation: the survival of the species and survival of ourselves,
p427
aVAnd those are both about perpetuating the genome.
p428
aa(lp429
VThe second goal, for those of us who have mastered the first goal \u2014
p430
aVcall it spiritual fulfillment, call it financial success,
p431
aVyou can call it any number of different things.
p432
aVI call it seeking joy, this pursuit of happiness.
p433
aVSo, I guess my theme on this is this guy lived his life to the fullest,
p434
aVhe absolutely did.
p435
aVYou have to balance those two goals.
p436
aVIf you live your whole life in fear \u2014
p437
aVI mean, life is a sexually transmitted disease with 100 percent mortality.
p438
aVSo you can't live your life in fear.
p439

V(Laughter)
p441
aa(lp442
VI thought that was an old one!
p443
aa(lp444
V(Applause)
p445
aa(lp446
VBut at the same time, you don't want to get so focused on rule number two,
p447
aVgoal number two,
p448
aVthat you neglect goal number one.
p449
aVBecause once you're dead, you really can't enjoy anything after that.
p450
aVSo I wish you all the best of luck in maintaining that balance
p451
aVin your future endeavors.
p452
aa(lp453
