VSo I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.
p4
aVA year and a half ago,
p5
aVfour of the five people who are full time members
p6
aVat Ushahidi,
p7
aVwhich means "testimony" in Swahili,
p8
aVwere TED Fellows.
p9
aVA year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence.
p10
aVAnd in that time we prototyped and built,
p11
aVin about three days, a system that would allow
p12
aVanybody with a mobile phone
p13
aVto send in information and reports on what was happening around them.
p14
aVWe took what we knew about Africa,
p15
aVthe default device,
p16
aVthe mobile phone, as our common denominator,
p17
aVand went from there.
p18
aVWe got reports like this.
p19
aVThis is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.
p20
aVAnd our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
p21
aVIt was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people,
p22
aVand we put it on our map.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut then we decided we needed to do something more.
p25
aVWe needed to take what we had built
p26
aVand create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.
p27
aVAnd so there is a team of developers
p28
aVfrom all over Africa, who are part of this team now \u2014
p29
aVfrom Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.
p30
aVThere is even some from the U.S.
p31
aVWe're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world,
p32
aVas well as the developing world.
p33
aa(lp34
VWe are realizing that this is true.
p35
aVIf it works in Africa then it will work anywhere.
p36
aVAnd so we build for it in Africa first
p37
aVand then we move to the edges.
p38
aVIt's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
p39
aVIt's being used by NGOs all over East Africa,
p40
aVsmall NGOs doing their own little projects.
p41
aVJust this last month it was deployed by
p42
aVAl Jazeera in Gaza.
p43
aVBut that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm here to talk about the next big thing,
p46
aVbecause what we're finding out is that
p47
aVwe have this capacity to report
p48
aVeyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.
p49
aVWe're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently,
p50
aVwhere it's so much easier to report now
p51
aVthan it is to consume it.
p52
aVThere is so much information; what do you do?
p53
aVThis is the Twitter reports for over three days
p54
aVjust covering Mumbai.
p55
aVHow do you decide what is important?
p56
aVWhat is the veracity level of what you're looking at?
p57
aVSo what we find is that there is this
p58
aVgreat deal of wasted crisis information
p59
aVbecause there is just too much information for us to
p60
aVactually do anything with right now.
p61
aVAnd what we're actually really concerned with
p62
aVis this first three hours.
p63
aVWhat we are looking at is the first three hours.
p64
aVHow do we deal with that information that is coming in?
p65
aVYou can't understand what is actually happening.
p66
aVOn the ground and around the world
p67
aVpeople are still curious,
p68
aVand trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo what we built of course, Ushahidi,
p71
aVis crowdsourcing this information.
p72
aVYou see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload.
p73
aVSo you've got a lot of information. That's great.
p74
aVBut now what?
p75
aVSo we think that there is something interesting we can do here.
p76
aVAnd we have a small team who is working on this.
p77
aVWe think that we can actually create
p78
aVa crowdsourced filter.
p79
aVTake the crowd and apply them to the information.
p80
aVAnd by rating it and by rating
p81
aVthe different people who submit information,
p82
aVwe can get refined results
p83
aVand weighted results.
p84
aVSo that we have a better understanding
p85
aVof the probability of something being true or not.
p86
aVThis is the kind of innovation that is,
p87
aVquite frankly \u2014 it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.
p88
aVIt's coming from places that you wouldn't expect.
p89
aVFrom young, smart developers.
p90
aVAnd it's a community around it that has decided to build this.
p91
aVSo, thank you very much.
p92
aVAnd we are very happy to be part of the TED family.
