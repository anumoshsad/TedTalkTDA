VSo just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?
p4
aVNot very many of you.
p5
aVOkay. And actually of those hands,
p6
aVif you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?
p7
aVSo a couple.
p8
aVThat's okay.
p9
aVThat's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive \u2014
p10
aVthat I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,
p13
aVwhether you're eight or 80.
p14
aVAnd as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,
p15
aVbecause you have to build a small, portable robot
p16
aVthat's not only really affordable,
p17
aVbut it has to be something
p18
aVthat people actually want to take home and have around their kids.
p19
aVThis robot can't be creepy or uncanny.
p20
aVHe should be friendly and cute.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo meet Romo.
p23
aVRomo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love \u2014
p24
aVyour iPhone \u2014 as his brain.
p25
aVAnd by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,
p26
aVwe can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled
p27
aVand computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,
p28
aVwhich is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhen Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.
p31
aVSo he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.
p32
aVIf I duck down, he'll follow me.
p33
aVHe's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.
p34
aVIf I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.
p35
aVIf I come over here \u2014 (Laughs)
p36
aVHe's smart.
p37
aVAnd if I get too close to him,
p38
aVhe gets scared just like any other creature.
p39
aVSo in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.
p40
aVThanks, little guy.
p41
aV(Sneezing sound)
p42
aVBless you.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd if I want to explore the world \u2014 uh-oh, Romo's tired \u2014
p45
aVif I want to explore the world with Romo,
p46
aVI can actually connect him from any other iOS device.
p47
aVSo here's the iPad.
p48
aVAnd Romo will actually stream video to this device.
p49
aVSo I can see everything that Romo sees,
p50
aVand I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.
p51
aVNow this is a free app on the App Store,
p52
aVso if any of you guys had this app on your phones,
p53
aVwe could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I'll show you really quickly,
p56
aVRomo actually \u2014 he's streaming video,
p57
aVso you can see me and the entire TED audience.
p58
aVIf I get in front of Romo here.
p59
aVAnd if I want to control him, I can just drive.
p60
aVSo I can drive him around,
p61
aVand I can take pictures of you.
p62
aVI've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.
p63
aVSo I'll snap a picture.
p64
aVAnd in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad,
p65
aVI can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.
p66
aVSo there are all of you through Romo's eyes.
p67
aVAnd finally, because Romo is an extension of me,
p68
aVI can express myself through his emotions.
p69
aVSo I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited.
p70
aa(lp71
VBut the most important thing about Romo
p72
aVis that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.
p73
aVYou do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.
p74
aVIn fact, who would like to drive a robot?
p75
aVOkay. Awesome.
p76
aVHere you go.
p77
aVThank you, Scott.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd even cooler, you actually don't have to be
p80
aVin the same geographic location as the robot to control him.
p81
aVSo he actually streams two-way audio and video
p82
aVbetween any two smart devices.
p83
aVSo you can log in through the browser,
p84
aVand it's kind of like Skype on wheels.
p85
aVSo we were talking before about telepresence,
p86
aVand this is a really cool example.
p87
aVYou can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone,
p88
aVand her mom buys her a robot.
p89
aVThat girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot,
p90
aVsend an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.
p91
aVGrandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter
p92
aVfor fifteen minutes every single night,
p93
aVwhen otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year.
p94
aa(lp95
VThanks, Scott.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Applause)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.
p100
aVBut I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.
p101
aVThis is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.
p102
aVIt's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.
p103
aVThis allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code
p104
aVand create any behavior for this robot you want.
p105
aVYou do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.
p106
aVAnd you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser,
p107
aVwhich is what you see Romo doing on the left.
p108
aVAnd then if you have something you like,
p109
aVyou can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life,
p110
aVrun the program in real life.
p111
aVAnd then if you have something you're proud of,
p112
aVyou can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.
p113
aVSo all of these wi-fi\u2013enabled robots actually learn from each other.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train
p116
aVis that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.
p117
aVThey change from person to person.
p118
aVSo we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home,
p119
aVthat robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.
p122
aVTo be honest, I have no idea.
p123
aVBut what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars
p124
aVor a large humanoid robot away.
p125
aVThe future of personal robotics is happening today,
p126
aVand it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo
p127
aVand the creativity of people like yourselves.
p128
aVSo we can't wait to get you all robots,
p129
aVand we can't wait to see what you build.
p130
aa(lp131
VThank you.
