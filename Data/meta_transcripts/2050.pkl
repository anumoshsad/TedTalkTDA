VI would like to share with you a new model of higher education,
p4
aVa model that, once expanded,
p5
aVcan enhance the collective intelligence
p6
aVof millions of creative and motivated individuals
p7
aVthat otherwise would be left behind.
p8
aVLook at the world.
p9
aVPick a place and focus on it.
p10
aVYou will find humans chasing higher education.
p11
aVLet's meet some of them.
p12
aa(lp13
VPatrick.
p14
aVPatrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children.
p15
aVDuring the civil war,
p16
aVhe and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria.
p17
aVThere, in spite of his situation,
p18
aVhe graduated high school with nearly perfect grades.
p19
aVHe wanted to continue to higher education,
p20
aVbut due to his family living on the poverty line,
p21
aVhe was soon sent to South Africa
p22
aVto work and send back money to feed his family.
p23
aVPatrick never gave up his dream of higher education.
p24
aVLate at night, after work,
p25
aVhe surfed the net, looking for ways to study.
p26
aa(lp27
VMeet Debbie.
p28
aVDebbie is from Florida.
p29
aVHer parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings.
p30
aVDebbie has worked all her life,
p31
aVpays taxes, supports herself month to month,
p32
aVproud of the American dream,
p33
aVa dream that just won't be complete without higher education.
p34
aVBut Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education.
p35
aVShe can't pay the tuition.
p36
aVNeither could she leave work.
p37
aa(lp38
VMeet Wael.
p39
aVWael is from Syria.
p40
aVHe's experiencing firsthand
p41
aVthe misery, fear and failure imposed on his country.
p42
aVHe's a big believer in education.
p43
aVHe knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education,
p44
aVan opportunity to get ahead of the rest,
p45
aVhe has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down.
p46
aa(lp47
VThe higher education system
p48
aVfailed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,
p49
aVexactly as it is failing millions of potential students \u2014
p50
aVmillions that graduate high school,
p51
aVmillions that are qualified for higher education,
p52
aVmillions that want to study yet cannot access it for various reasons.
p53
aVFirst: financial.
p54
aVUniversities are expensive; we all know it.
p55
aVIn large parts of the world,
p56
aVhigher education is unattainable for an average citizen.
p57
aVThis is probably the biggest problem facing our society.
p58
aVHigher education stopped being a right for all
p59
aVand became a privilege for the few.
p60
aa(lp61
VSecond: cultural.
p62
aVStudents who are qualified for higher education
p63
aVcan afford \u2014 want to study \u2014 cannot,
p64
aVbecause it is not decent, it is not a place for a woman.
p65
aVThis is the story of countless women in Africa, for example,
p66
aVprevented from higher education because of cultural barriers.
p67
aVAnd here comes the third reason:
p68
aVUNESCO stated that in 2025,
p69
aV100 million students will be deprived of higher education,
p70
aVsimply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them,
p71
aVto meet the demand.
p72
aVThey will take a placement test, they will pass it,
p73
aVbut they still won't have access, because there are no places available.
p74
aa(lp75
VThese are the reasons I founded University of the People,
p76
aVa nonprofit, tuition-free, degree-granting university
p77
aVto give an alternative,
p78
aVto create an alternative, to those who have no other;
p79
aVan alternative that will be affordable and scalable,
p80
aVan alternative that will disrupt the current education system,
p81
aVand open the gates to higher education for every qualified student
p82
aVregardless of what they earn, where they live,
p83
aVor what society says about them.
p84
aVPatrick, Debbie and Wael
p85
aVare only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students
p86
aVfrom 143 countries.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Applause)
p89
aVThank you.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VWe didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
p94
aVWe just looked at what wasn't working
p95
aVand used the amazing power of the Internet
p96
aVto get around it.
p97
aVWe set out to build a model
p98
aVthat will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education.
p99
aVAnd that's how we did it.
p100
aVFirst, bricks and mortar cost money.
p101
aVUniversities have expenses that virtual universities don't.
p102
aVWe don't need to pass these expenses on to our students.
p103
aVThey don't exist.
p104
aVWe also don't need to worry about capacity.
p105
aVThere are no limits of seats in virtual university.
p106
aVActually, nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall.
p107
aVTextbooks are also something our students don't need to buy.
p108
aVBy using open educational resources
p109
aVand the generosity of professors
p110
aVwho are putting their material up free and accessible,
p111
aVwe don't need to send our students to buy textbooks.
p112
aVAll of our materials come free.
p113
aa(lp114
VEven professors,
p115
aVthe most expensive line in any university balance sheet,
p116
aVcome free to our students.
p117
aVOver 3,000 of them,
p118
aVincluding presidents, vice chancellors, professors and academic advisers
p119
aVfrom top universities such as NYU, Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,
p120
aVcame on board to help our students.
p121
aa(lp122
VFinally, is our belief in peer-to-peer learning.
p123
aVWe use this sound pedagogical model
p124
aVto encourage our students from all over the world
p125
aVto interact and study together,
p126
aVand also to reduce the time our professors need
p127
aVto labor over class assignments.
p128
aa(lp129
VIf the Internet has made us a global village,
p130
aVthis model can develop its future leadership.
p131
aVLook how we do it.
p132
aVWe only offer two programs:
p133
aVbusiness administration and computer science,
p134
aVthe two programs most in demand worldwide,
p135
aVthe two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job.
p136
aVWhen our students are accepted,
p137
aVthey are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students,
p138
aVto ensure that those who need personalized attention get it.
p139
aVMoreover, for every nine-week course, they meet a new peer,
p140
aVa whole new set of students from all over the world.
p141
aVEvery week, when they go into the classroom,
p142
aVthey find the lecture notes of the week,
p143
aVthe reading assignment, the homework assignment,
p144
aVand the discussion question, which is the core of our studies.
p145
aVEvery week, every student must contribute to the class discussion,
p146
aVand also must comment on the contribution of others.
p147
aVThis way, we open our students' minds,
p148
aVwe develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures.
p149
aVBy the end of each week, the students take a quiz,
p150
aVhand in their homework,
p151
aVwhich are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors,
p152
aVget a grade, move to the next week.
p153
aVBy the end of the course, they take the final exam,
p154
aVget a grade, and follow to the next course.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe open the gates for higher education for every qualified student.
p157
aVEvery student with a high school diploma,
p158
aVsufficient English and Internet connection
p159
aVcan study with us.
p160
aVWe don't use audio, we don't use video.
p161
aVBroadband is not necessary.
p162
aVAny student from any part of the world with any Internet connection
p163
aVcan study with us.
p164
aVWe are tuition free.
p165
aVAll we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams,
p166
aV100 dollars per exam.
p167
aVA full-time bachelor's degree student taking 40 courses
p168
aVwill pay 1,000 dollars a year,
p169
aV4,000 dollars for the entire degree.
p170
aVAnd for those who cannot afford even this,
p171
aVwe offer them a variety of scholarships.
p172
aVIt is our mission that nobody will be left behind
p173
aVfor financial reasons.
p174
aVWith 5,000 students in 2016, this model is financially sustainable.
p175
aa(lp176
VFive years ago, it was a vision.
p177
aVToday, it is a reality.
p178
aVLast month, we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model.
p179
aVUniversity of the People is now fully accredited.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VThank you.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VWith this accreditation, it's our time now to scale up.
p188
aVWe have demonstrated that our model works.
p189
aVI invite universities and, even more important,
p190
aVdeveloping countries' governments,
p191
aVto replicate this model
p192
aVto ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely.
p193
aVA new era is coming \u2014
p194
aVan era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model
p195
aVas we know it today,
p196
aVfrom being a privilege for the few
p197
aVto becoming a basic right, affordable and accessible for all.
p198
aa(lp199
VThank you.
