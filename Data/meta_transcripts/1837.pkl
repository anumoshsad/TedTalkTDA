VI think we're all aware
p4
aVthat the world today is full of problems.
p5
aVWe've been hearing them
p6
aVtoday and yesterday and every day for decades.
p7
aVSerious problems, big problems, pressing problems.
p8
aVPoor nutrition, access to water,
p9
aVclimate change, deforestation,
p10
aVlack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,
p11
aVnot enough healthcare, pollution.
p12
aVThere's problem after problem,
p13
aVand I think what really separates this time
p14
aVfrom any time I can remember in my brief time
p15
aVon Earth is the awareness of these problems.
p16
aVWe're all very aware.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhy are we having so much trouble
p19
aVdealing with these problems?
p20
aVThat's the question I've been struggling with,
p21
aVcoming from my very different perspective.
p22
aVI'm not a social problem guy.
p23
aVI'm a guy that works with business,
p24
aVhelps business make money.
p25
aVGod forbid.
p26
aVSo why are we having so many problems
p27
aVwith these social problems,
p28
aVand really is there any role for business,
p29
aVand if so, what is that role?
p30
aVI think that in order to address that question,
p31
aVwe have to step back and think about
p32
aVhow we've understood and pondered
p33
aVboth the problems and the solutions
p34
aVto these great social challenges that we face.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, I think many have seen business
p37
aVas the problem, or at least one of the problems,
p38
aVin many of the social challenges we face.
p39
aVYou know, think of the fast food industry,
p40
aVthe drug industry, the banking industry.
p41
aVYou know, this is a low point
p42
aVin the respect for business.
p43
aVBusiness is not seen as the solution.
p44
aVIt's seen as the problem now, for most people.
p45
aVAnd rightly so, in many cases.
p46
aVThere's a lot of bad actors out there
p47
aVthat have done the wrong thing,
p48
aVthat actually have made the problem worse.
p49
aVSo this perspective is perhaps justified.
p50
aa(lp51
VHow have we tended to see the solutions
p52
aVto these social problems,
p53
aVthese many issues that we face in society?
p54
aVWell, we've tended to see the solutions
p55
aVin terms of NGOs,
p56
aVin terms of government,
p57
aVin terms of philanthropy.
p58
aVIndeed, the kind of unique organizational entity
p59
aVof this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs
p60
aVand social organizations.
p61
aVThis is a unique, new organizational form
p62
aVthat we've seen grown up.
p63
aVEnormous innovation, enormous energy,
p64
aVenormous talent now has been mobilized
p65
aVthrough this structure
p66
aVto try to deal with all of these challenges.
p67
aVAnd many of us here are deeply involved in that.
p68
aa(lp69
VI'm a business school professor,
p70
aVbut I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.
p71
aVWhenever I got interested and became aware
p72
aVof a societal problem, that was what I did,
p73
aVform a nonprofit.
p74
aVThat was the way we've thought about how to deal
p75
aVwith these issues.
p76
aVEven a business school professor has thought about it that way.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut I think at this moment,
p79
aVwe've been at this for quite a while.
p80
aVWe've been aware of these problems for decades.
p81
aVWe have decades of experience
p82
aVwith our NGOs and with our government entities,
p83
aVand there's an awkward reality.
p84
aVThe awkward reality is we're not making
p85
aVfast enough progress.
p86
aVWe're not winning.
p87
aVThese problems still seem very daunting
p88
aVand very intractable,
p89
aVand any solutions we're achieving
p90
aVare small solutions.
p91
aVWe're making incremental progress.
p92
aa(lp93
VWhat's the fundamental problem we have
p94
aVin dealing with these social problems?
p95
aVIf we cut all the complexity away,
p96
aVwe have the problem of scale.
p97
aVWe can't scale.
p98
aVWe can make progress. We can show benefits.
p99
aVWe can show results. We can make things better.
p100
aVWe're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.
p101
aVWe can't scale.
p102
aVWe can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.
p103
aVWhy is that?
p104
aVBecause we don't have the resources.
p105
aVAnd that's really clear now.
p106
aVAnd that's clearer now than it's been for decades.
p107
aVThere's simply not enough money
p108
aVto deal with any of these problems at scale
p109
aVusing the current model.
p110
aVThere's not enough tax revenue,
p111
aVthere's not enough philanthropic donations,
p112
aVto deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.
p113
aVWe've got to confront that reality.
p114
aVAnd the scarcity of resources
p115
aVfor dealing with these problems is only growing,
p116
aVcertainly in the advanced world today,
p117
aVwith all the fiscal problems we face.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo if it's fundamentally a resource problem,
p120
aVwhere are the resources in society?
p121
aVHow are those resources really created,
p122
aVthe resources we're going to need to deal
p123
aVwith all these societal challenges?
p124
aVWell there, I think the answer is very clear:
p125
aVThey're in business.
p126
aVAll wealth is actually created by business.
p127
aVBusiness creates wealth
p128
aVwhen it meets needs at a profit.
p129
aVThat's how all wealth is created.
p130
aVIt's meeting needs at a profit
p131
aVthat leads to taxes
p132
aVand that leads to incomes
p133
aVand that leads to charitable donations.
p134
aVThat's where all the resources come from.
p135
aVOnly business can actually create resources.
p136
aVOther institutions can utilize them
p137
aVto do important work,
p138
aVbut only business can create them.
p139
aVAnd business creates them
p140
aVwhen it's able to meet a need at a profit.
p141
aVThe resources are overwhelmingly
p142
aVgenerated by business.
p143
aVThe question then is, how do we tap into this?
p144
aVHow do we tap into this?
p145
aVBusiness generates those resources
p146
aVwhen it makes a profit.
p147
aVThat profit is that small difference
p148
aVbetween the price and the cost it takes to produce
p149
aVwhatever solution business has created
p150
aVto whatever problem they're trying to solve.
p151
aVBut that profit is the magic.
p152
aVWhy? Because that profit allows whatever solution
p153
aVwe've created
p154
aVto be infinitely scalable.
p155
aVBecause if we can make a profit,
p156
aVwe can do it for 10, 100, a million,
p157
aV100 million, a billion.
p158
aVThe solution becomes self-sustaining.
p159
aVThat's what business does
p160
aVwhen it makes a profit.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow what does this all have to do
p163
aVwith social problems?
p164
aVWell, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit
p165
aVand redeploy it into social problems.
p166
aVBusiness should give more.
p167
aVBusiness should be more responsible.
p168
aVAnd that's been the path that we've been on
p169
aVin business.
p170
aVBut again, this path that we've been on
p171
aVis not getting us where we need to go.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, I started out as a strategy professor,
p174
aVand I'm still a strategy professor.
p175
aVI'm proud of that.
p176
aVBut I've also, over the years,
p177
aVworked more and more on social issues.
p178
aVI've worked on healthcare, the environment,
p179
aVeconomic development, reducing poverty,
p180
aVand as I worked more and more in the social field,
p181
aVI started seeing something
p182
aVthat had a profound impact on me
p183
aVand my whole life, in a way.
p184
aa(lp185
VThe conventional wisdom in economics
p186
aVand the view in business has historically been
p187
aVthat actually, there's a tradeoff
p188
aVbetween social performance and economic performance.
p189
aVThe conventional wisdom has been
p190
aVthat business actually makes a profit
p191
aVby causing a social problem.
p192
aVThe classic example is pollution.
p193
aVIf business pollutes, it makes more money
p194
aVthan if it tried to reduce that pollution.
p195
aVReducing pollution is expensive,
p196
aVtherefore businesses don't want to do it.
p197
aVIt's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.
p198
aVIt's too expensive to have a safe working environment,
p199
aVtherefore business makes more money
p200
aVif they don't have a safe working environment.
p201
aVThat's been the conventional wisdom.
p202
aVA lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.
p203
aVThey resisted environmental improvement.
p204
aVThey resisted workplace improvement.
p205
aVThat thinking has led to, I think,
p206
aVmuch of the behavior
p207
aVthat we have come to criticize in business,
p208
aVthat I come to criticize in business.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut the more deeply I got into all these social issues,
p211
aVone after another,
p212
aVand actually, the more I tried to address them
p213
aVmyself, personally, in a few cases,
p214
aVthrough nonprofits that I was involved with,
p215
aVthe more I found actually that the reality
p216
aVis the opposite.
p217
aVBusiness does not profit
p218
aVfrom causing social problems,
p219
aVactually not in any fundamental sense.
p220
aVThat's a very simplistic view.
p221
aVThe deeper we get into these issues,
p222
aVthe more we start to understand
p223
aVthat actually business profits
p224
aVfrom solving from social problems.
p225
aVThat's where the real profit comes.
p226
aVLet's take pollution.
p227
aVWe've learned today that actually
p228
aVreducing pollution and emissions
p229
aVis generating profit.
p230
aVIt saves money.
p231
aVIt makes the business more productive and efficient.
p232
aVIt doesn't waste resources.
p233
aVHaving a safer working environment actually,
p234
aVand avoiding accidents,
p235
aVit makes the business more profitable,
p236
aVbecause it's a sign of good processes.
p237
aVAccidents are expensive and costly.
p238
aVIssue by issue by issue, we start to learn
p239
aVthat actually there's no trade-off
p240
aVbetween social progress
p241
aVand economic efficiency
p242
aVin any fundamental sense.
p243
aVAnother issue is health.
p244
aVI mean, what we've found is actually
p245
aVhealth of employees is something
p246
aVthat business should treasure,
p247
aVbecause that health allows those employees
p248
aVto be more productive and come to work
p249
aVand not be absent.
p250
aVThe deeper work, the new work, the new thinking
p251
aVon the interface between business and social problems
p252
aVis actually showing that there's a fundamental,
p253
aVdeep synergy,
p254
aVparticularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.
p255
aVIn the very short run, you can sometimes
p256
aVfool yourself into thinking
p257
aVthat there's fundamentally opposing goals,
p258
aVbut in the long run, ultimately, we're learning
p259
aVin field after field that this is simply not true.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo how could we tap into
p262
aVthe power of business
p263
aVto address the fundamental problems
p264
aVthat we face?
p265
aVImagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,
p266
aVwe could scale.
p267
aVWe could tap into this enormous resource pool
p268
aVand this organizational capacity.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd guess what? That's happening now, finally,
p271
aVpartly because of people like you
p272
aVwho have raised these issues now
p273
aVfor year after year and decade after decade.
p274
aVWe see organizations like Dow Chemical
p275
aVleading the revolution away from trans fat
p276
aVand saturated fat with innovative new products.
p277
aVThis is an example of Jain Irrigation.
p278
aVThis is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology
p279
aVto thousands and millions of farmers,
p280
aVreducing substantially the use of water.
p281
aVWe see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria
p282
aVthat's figured out how to avoid
p283
aVtearing down old growth forest
p284
aVand using eucalyptus and getting much more yield
p285
aVper hectare of pulp
p286
aVand making much more paper than you could make
p287
aVby cutting down those old trees.
p288
aVYou see companies like Cisco that are training
p289
aVso far four million people in I.T. skills
p290
aVto actually, yes, be responsible,
p291
aVbut help expand the opportunity
p292
aVto disseminate I.T. technology
p293
aVand grow the whole business.
p294
aVThere's a fundamental opportunity for business today
p295
aVto impact and address these social problems,
p296
aVand this opportunity
p297
aVis the largest business opportunity
p298
aVwe see in business.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd the question is, how can we get business
p301
aVthinking to adapt this issue of shared value?
p302
aVThis is what I call shared value:
p303
aVaddressing a social issue with a business model.
p304
aVThat's shared value.
p305
aVShared value is capitalism,
p306
aVbut it's a higher kind of capitalism.
p307
aVIt's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,
p308
aVmeeting important needs,
p309
aVnot incrementally competing for
p310
aVtrivial differences in product attributes
p311
aVand market share.
p312
aVShared value is when we can create social value
p313
aVand economic value simultaneously.
p314
aVIt's finding those opportunities
p315
aVthat will unleash the greatest possibility we have
p316
aVto actually address these social problems
p317
aVbecause we can scale.
p318
aVWe can address shared value at multiple levels.
p319
aVIt's real. It's happening.
p320
aa(lp321
VBut in order to get this solution working,
p322
aVwe have to now change how business sees itself,
p323
aVand this is thankfully underway.
p324
aVBusinesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom
p325
aVthat they shouldn't worry about social problems,
p326
aVthat this was sort of something on the side,
p327
aVthat somebody else was doing it.
p328
aVWe're now seeing companies
p329
aVembrace this idea.
p330
aVBut we also have to recognize business
p331
aVis not going to do this as effectively
p332
aVas if we have NGOs and government
p333
aVworking in partnership with business.
p334
aVThe new NGOs that are really moving the needle
p335
aVare the ones that have found these partnerships,
p336
aVthat have found these ways to collaborate.
p337
aVThe governments that are making the most progress
p338
aVare the governments that have found ways
p339
aVto enable shared value in business
p340
aVrather than see government as the only player
p341
aVthat has to call the shots.
p342
aVAnd government has many ways in which it could impact
p343
aVthe willingness and the ability of companies
p344
aVto compete in this way.
p345
aa(lp346
VI think if we can get business seeing itself differently,
p347
aVand if we can get others seeing business differently,
p348
aVwe can change the world.
p349
aVI know it. I'm seeing it.
p350
aVI'm feeling it.
p351
aVYoung people, I think,
p352
aVmy Harvard Business School students, are getting it.
p353
aVIf we can break down this sort of divide,
p354
aVthis unease, this tension,
p355
aVthis sense that we're not
p356
aVfundamentally collaborating here
p357
aVin driving these social problems,
p358
aVwe can break this down,
p359
aVand we finally, I think,
p360
aVcan have solutions.
