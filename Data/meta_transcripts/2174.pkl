VI want to speak about  a forgotten conflict.
p4
aVIt's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.
p5
aVIt happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo,
p8
aVso let me give you a couple of key facts.
p9
aVThe Congolese conflict is the deadliest  conflict since World War II.
p10
aVIt has caused almost four million deaths.
p11
aVIt has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past 18 years.
p12
aVIt is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the world.
p13
aa(lp14
VThat's why I first went to Congo in 2001.
p15
aVI was a young humanitarian aid worker, and I met this woman who was my age.
p16
aVShe was called Isabelle.
p17
aVLocal militias had attacked Isabelle's village.
p18
aVThey had killed many men, raped many women.
p19
aVThey had looted everything.
p20
aVAnd then they wanted to take Isabelle,
p21
aVbut her husband stepped in,
p22
aVand he said, "No, please don't take Isabelle.
p23
aVTake me instead."
p24
aVSo he had gone to the forest with the militias,
p25
aVand Isabelle had never seen him again.
p26
aa(lp27
VWell, it's because of people like Isabelle and her husband
p28
aVthat I have devoted my career to studying this war
p29
aVthat we know so little about.
p30
aa(lp31
VAlthough there is one story about Congo that you may have heard.
p32
aVIt's a story about minerals and rape.
p33
aVPolicy statements and media reports
p34
aVboth usually focus on a primary cause of violence in Congo \u2014
p35
aVthe illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources \u2014
p36
aVand on a main consequence \u2014
p37
aVsexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, not that these two issues aren't important and tragic. They are.
p40
aVBut today I want to tell you  a different story.
p41
aVI want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause
p42
aVof the ongoing conflict.
p43
aVViolence in Congo is in large part driven by local bottom-up conflicts
p44
aVthat international peace efforts have failed to help address.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe story starts from the fact that not only is Congo notable
p47
aVfor being the world's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis,
p48
aVbut it is also home to some of the largest
p49
aVinternational peacebuilding efforts in the world.
p50
aVCongo hosts the largest
p51
aVand most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world.
p52
aVIt was also the site of the first European-led peacekeeping mission,
p53
aVand for its first cases ever,
p54
aVthe International Criminal Court chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.
p55
aVIn 2006, when Congo held the first  free national elections in its history,
p56
aVmany observers thought that an end to  violence in the region had finally come.
p57
aVThe international community lauded the  successful organization of these elections
p58
aVas finally an example of successful international intervention
p59
aVin a failed state.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut the eastern provinces
p62
aVhave continued to face massive population displacements
p63
aVand horrific human rights violations.
p64
aVShortly before I went back there last summer,
p65
aVthere was a horrible massacre in the province of South Kivu.
p66
aVThirty-three people were killed.
p67
aVThey were mostly women and children,
p68
aVand many of them were hacked to death.
p69
aVDuring the past eight years,
p70
aVfighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited
p71
aVfull-scale civil and international war.
p72
aVSo basically, every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace,
p73
aVthe conflict explodes again.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhy?
p76
aVWhy have the massive international efforts
p77
aVfailed to help Congo  achieve lasting peace and security?
p78
aVWell, my answer to this question revolves around two central observations.
p79
aVFirst, one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in Congo
p80
aVis fundamentally local \u2014
p81
aVand when I say local,
p82
aVI really mean at the level of the individual, the family,
p83
aVthe clan, the municipality, the community, the district,
p84
aVsometimes the ethnic group.
p85
aVFor instance, you remember the story of Isabelle that I told you.
p86
aVWell, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village
p87
aVwas because they wanted to take the land
p88
aVthat the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe second central observation is that international peace efforts
p91
aVhave failed to help address local conflicts
p92
aVbecause of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture.
p93
aVSo what I mean is that
p94
aVWestern and African diplomats,
p95
aVUnited Nations peacekeepers, donors,
p96
aVthe staff of most nongovernmental organizations
p97
aVthat work with the resolution of conflict,
p98
aVthey all share a specific way of seeing the world.
p99
aVAnd I was one of these people, and I shared this culture,
p100
aVso I know all too well how powerful it is.
p101
aVThroughout the world, and throughout conflict zones,
p102
aVthis common culture shapes the intervener's understanding
p103
aVof the causes of violence
p104
aVas something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres.
p105
aVIt shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
p106
aVas something again that requires top-down intervention
p107
aVto address national and international tensions.
p108
aVAnd it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors
p109
aVas engaging in national and international peace processes.
p110
aVEven more importantly, this common culture
p111
aVenables international peacebuilders to ignore the micro-level tensions
p112
aVthat often jeopardize the macro-level settlements.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo for instance, in Congo,
p115
aVbecause of how they are socialized and trained,
p116
aVUnited Nations officials, donors, diplomats,
p117
aVthe staff of most nongovernmental organizations,
p118
aVthey interpret continued fighting and massacres as a top-down problem.
p119
aVTo them, the violence they see
p120
aVis the consequence of tensions between President Kabila
p121
aVand various national opponents,
p122
aVand tensions between Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
p123
aVIn addition, these international  peacebuilders view local conflicts
p124
aVas simply the result of national and international tensions,
p125
aVinsufficient state authority,
p126
aVand what they call the Congolese people's so-called inherent penchant for violence.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe dominant culture also constructs intervention
p129
aVat the national and international levels
p130
aVas the only natural and legitimate task for United Nations staffers and diplomats.
p131
aVAnd it elevates the organization of general elections,
p132
aVwhich is now a sort of cure-all,
p133
aVas the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism
p134
aVover more effective state-building approaches.
p135
aVAnd that happens not only in Congo but also in many other conflict zones.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut let's dig deeper,
p138
aVinto the other main sources of violence.
p139
aVIn Congo, continuing violence
p140
aVis motivated not only by the national and international causes
p141
aVbut also by longstanding bottom-up agendas
p142
aVwhose main instigators are villagers, traditional chiefs,
p143
aVcommunity chiefs or ethnic leaders.
p144
aVMany conflicts revolve around political, social and economic stakes
p145
aVthat are distinctively local.
p146
aVFor instance, there is a lot of competition
p147
aVat the village or district level
p148
aVover who can be chief of village or chief of territory
p149
aVaccording to traditional law,
p150
aVand who can control the distribution of land
p151
aVand the exploitation of local mining sites.
p152
aVThis competition often results in localized fighting,
p153
aVfor instance in one village or territory,
p154
aVand quite frequently, it escalates into generalized fighting,
p155
aVso across a whole province,
p156
aVand even at times into neighboring countries.
p157
aa(lp158
VTake the conflict between Congolese  of Rwandan descent
p159
aVand the so-called indigenous  communities of the Kivus.
p160
aVThis conflict started in the 1930s during Belgian colonization,
p161
aVwhen both communities competed over access to land and to local power.
p162
aVThen, in 1960, after Congolese independence,
p163
aVit escalated because each camp tried to align with national politicians,
p164
aVbut still to advance their local agendas.
p165
aVAnd then, at the time of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
p166
aVthese local actors allied with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,
p167
aVbut still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the Kivus.
p168
aVAnd since then, these local disputes over land and local power
p169
aVhave fueled violence,
p170
aVand they have regularly jeopardized
p171
aVthe national and international settlements.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo we can wonder why in these circumstances
p174
aVthe international peacebuilders have failed to help implement
p175
aVlocal peacebuilding programs.
p176
aVAnd the answer is that international interveners
p177
aVdeem the resolution of grassroots conflict
p178
aVan unimportant, unfamiliar, and illegitimate task.
p179
aVThe very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally
p180
aVwith existing cultural norms,
p181
aVand it threatens key organizational interests.
p182
aVFor instance, the very identity of the United Nations
p183
aVas this macro-level diplomatic organization
p184
aVwould be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts.
p185
aVAnd the result is that neither the internal resistance
p186
aVto the dominant ways of working
p187
aVnor the external shocks
p188
aVhave managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate
p189
aVtheir understanding of violence and intervention.
p190
aVAnd so far, there have been only very few exceptions.
p191
aVThere have been exceptions, but only very few exceptions,
p192
aVto this broad pattern.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo to wrap up, the story I just told you
p195
aVis a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture
p196
aVshapes the intervener's understanding of what the causes of violence are,
p197
aVhow peace is made,
p198
aVand what interventions should accomplish.
p199
aVThese understandings enable international peacebuilders
p200
aVto ignore the micro-level foundations
p201
aVthat are so necessary for sustainable peace.
p202
aVThe resulting inattention to local conflicts
p203
aVleads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term
p204
aVand potential war resumption in the long term.
p205
aVAnd what's fascinating is that this analysis
p206
aVhelps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict
p207
aVand international intervention failures, in Africa and elsewhere.
p208
aVLocal conflicts fuel violence in most war and post-war environments,
p209
aVfrom Afghanistan to Sudan to Timor-Leste,
p210
aVand in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive,
p211
aVbottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,
p212
aVthese attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable.
p213
aVOne of the best examples is the contrast
p214
aVbetween the relatively peaceful situation in Somaliland,
p215
aVwhich benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,
p216
aVand the violence prevalent in the rest of Somalia,
p217
aVwhere peacebuilding has been mostly top-down.
p218
aVAnd there are several other cases
p219
aVin which local, grassroots conflict resolution
p220
aVhas made a crucial difference.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo if we want international peacebuilding to work,
p223
aVin addition to any top-down intervention,
p224
aVconflicts must be resolved from the bottom up.
p225
aVAnd again, it's not that national and international tensions don't matter.
p226
aVThey do.
p227
aVAnd it's not that national and international peacebuilding
p228
aVisn't necessary.
p229
aVIt is.
p230
aVInstead, it is that both macro-level and micro-level peacebuilding are needed
p231
aVto make peace sustainable,
p232
aVand local nongovernmental organizations,
p233
aVlocal authorities and  civil society representatives
p234
aVshould be the main actors in the bottom-up process.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo of course, there are obstacles.
p237
aVLocal actors often lack the funding
p238
aVand sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity
p239
aVto implement effective, local peacebuilding programs.
p240
aVSo international actors should expand their funding and support
p241
aVfor local conflict resolution.
p242
aa(lp243
VAs for Congo, what can be done?
p244
aVAfter two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions,
p245
aVit's clear that we need to change our approach.
p246
aVBased on my field research,
p247
aVI believe that international and Congolese actors
p248
aVshould pay more attention to the resolution of land conflict
p249
aVand the promotion of inter-community reconciliation.
p250
aVSo for instance, in the province of the Kivus,
p251
aVthe Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese partners
p252
aVhave set up inter-community forums
p253
aVto discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land,
p254
aVand these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence.
p255
aVThat's the kind of program that is sorely needed
p256
aVthroughout eastern Congo.
p257
aVIt's with programs like this
p258
aVthat we can help people like Isabelle and her husband.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo these will not be magic wands,
p261
aVbut because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence,
p262
aVthey could definitely be game-changers.
p263
