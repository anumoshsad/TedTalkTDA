VIn the spring of 2016,
p4
aVa legal battle between Apple and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
p5
aVcaptured the world's attention.
p6
aa(lp7
VApple has built security features into its mobile products
p8
aVwhich protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner.
p9
aVThat means that criminals, hackers and yes, even governments
p10
aVare all locked out.
p11
aVFor Apple's customers, this is a great thing.
p12
aVBut governments are not so happy.
p13
aVYou see, Apple has made a conscious decision
p14
aVto get out of the surveillance business.
p15
aVApple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible
p16
aVfor governments and any other actors.
p17
aa(lp18
VThere are really two smartphone operating systems
p19
aVin the global smartphone market:
p20
aViOS and Android.
p21
aViOS is made by Apple. Android is made by Google.
p22
aVApple has spent a lot of time and money
p23
aVto make sure that its products are as secure as possible.
p24
aVApple encrypts all data stored on iPhones by default,
p25
aVand text messages sent from one Apple customer to another Apple customer
p26
aVare encrypted by default
p27
aVwithout the user having to take any actions.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhat this means is that,
p30
aVif the police seize an iPhone and it has a password,
p31
aVthey'll have a difficult time getting any data off of it,
p32
aVif they can do it at all.
p33
aVIn contrast, the security of Android just really isn't as good.
p34
aVAndroid phones, or at least most of the Android phones
p35
aVthat have been sold to consumers,
p36
aVdo not encrypt data stored on the device by default,
p37
aVand the built-in text messaging app in Android does not use encryption.
p38
aVSo if the police seize an Android phone,
p39
aVchances are, they'll be able to get all the data they want
p40
aVoff of that device.
p41
aa(lp42
VTwo smartphones
p43
aVfrom two of the biggest companies in the world;
p44
aVone that protects data by default,
p45
aVand one that doesn't.
p46
aa(lp47
VApple is a seller of luxury goods.
p48
aVIt dominates the high end of the market.
p49
aVAnd we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products
p50
aVthat include more features.
p51
aVBut not everyone can afford an iPhone.
p52
aVThat's where Android really, really dominates:
p53
aVat the middle and low end of the market,
p54
aVsmartphones for the billion and a half people
p55
aVwho cannot or will not spend
p56
aV600 dollars on a phone.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut the dominance of Android has led to what I call
p59
aVthe "digital security divide."
p60
aVThat is, there is now increasingly a gap
p61
aVbetween the privacy and security of the rich,
p62
aVwho can afford devices that secure their data by default,
p63
aVand of the poor,
p64
aVwhose devices do very little to protect them by default.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, think of the average Apple customer:
p67
aVa banker, a lawyer, a doctor, a politician.
p68
aVThese individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets
p69
aVthat encrypt their calls, their text messages,
p70
aVall the data on the device,
p71
aVwithout them doing really anything to secure their information.
p72
aVIn contrast, the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies
p73
aVare using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance.
p74
aa(lp75
VIn the United States, where I live,
p76
aVAfrican-Americans are more likely to be seen as suspicious
p77
aVor more likely to be profiled,
p78
aVand are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance.
p79
aVBut African-Americans are also disproportionately likely
p80
aVto use Android devices that do nothing at all
p81
aVto protect them from that surveillance.
p82
aVThis is a problem.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe must remember that surveillance is a tool.
p85
aVIt's a tool used by those in power
p86
aVagainst those who have no power.
p87
aVAnd while I think it's absolutely great
p88
aVthat companies like Apple are making it easy for people to encrypt,
p89
aVif the only people who can protect themselves
p90
aVfrom the gaze of the government
p91
aVare the rich and powerful,
p92
aVthat's a problem.
p93
aVAnd it's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem.
p94
aVIt's a civil rights problem.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo the lack of default security in Android
p97
aVis not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users
p98
aVwho are depending on these devices.
p99
aVThis is actually a problem for our democracy.
p100
aVI'll explain what I mean.
p101
aa(lp102
VModern social movements rely on technology \u2014
p103
aVfrom Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street.
p104
aVThe organizers of these movements and the members of these movements
p105
aVincreasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones.
p106
aVAnd so, naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements
p107
aVwill also target the organizers and their smartphones.
p108
aVNow, it's quite possible
p109
aVthat a future Martin Luther King or a Mandela or a Gandhi
p110
aVwill have an iPhone and be protected from government surveillance.
p111
aVBut chances are,
p112
aVthey'll probably have a cheap, $20 Android phone in their pocket.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide,
p115
aVif we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society
p116
aVgets the same benefits of encryption
p117
aVand is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state,
p118
aVnot only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance,
p119
aVbut future civil rights movements may be crushed
p120
aVbefore they ever reach their full potential.
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Applause)
p125
aa(lp126
VHelen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.
p127
aVI have a question for you.
p128
aVWe saw recently in the press
p129
aVthat Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook covers over his camera
p130
aVand does something with his headphone mic jack.
p131
aVSo I wanted to ask you a personal question, which is:
p132
aVDo you do that?
p133
aVAnd, on behalf of everyone here, particularly myself,
p134
aVShould we be doing that?
p135
aVShould we be covering these things?
p136
aa(lp137
VChristopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker \u2014 actually, I like Band-Aids,
p138
aVbecause you can remove them and put them back on
p139
aVwhenever you want to make a call or a Skype call.
p140
aVPutting a sticker over your web cam
p141
aVis probably the best thing you can do for your privacy
p142
aVin terms of bang for buck.
p143
aVThere really is malware, malicious software out there
p144
aVthat can take over your web cam,
p145
aVeven without the light turning on.
p146
aVThis is used by criminals. This is used by stalkers.
p147
aVYou can buy $19.99 "spy on your ex-girlfriend" software online.
p148
aVIt's really terrifying.
p149
aVAnd then, of course, it's used by governments.
p150
aVAnd there's obviously a sexual violence component to this,
p151
aVwhich is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively
p152
aVagainst women and other people who can be shamed in our society.
p153
aVEven if you think you have nothing to hide,
p154
aVat the very least, if you have children, teenagers in your lives,
p155
aVmake sure you put a sticker on their camera and protect them.
p156
aa(lp157
VHW: Wow. Thank you so much. CS: Thank you.
