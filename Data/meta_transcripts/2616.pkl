VI want to talk to you about my kids.
p4
aVNow, I know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic,
p5
aVthe most beautiful kid that ever lived.
p6
aVBut mine really are.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI have 696 kids,
p11
aVand they are the most intelligent, inventive, innovative,
p12
aVbrilliant and powerful kids that you'll ever meet.
p13
aa(lp14
VAny student I've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid.
p15
aVHowever, because their "real" parents aren't rich
p16
aVand, I argue, because they are mostly of color,
p17
aVthey will seldom get to see in themselves
p18
aVthe awesomeness that I see in them.
p19
aVBecause what I see in them is myself \u2014
p20
aVor what would have been myself.
p21
aa(lp22
VI am the daughter of two hardworking,
p23
aVcollege-educated, African-American parents
p24
aVwho chose careers as public servants:
p25
aVmy father, a minister; my mother, an educator.
p26
aVWealth was never the primary ambition in our house.
p27
aVBecause of this lack of wealth,
p28
aVwe lived in a neighborhood that lacked wealth,
p29
aVand henceforth a school system that lacked wealth.
p30
aVLuckily, however, we struck the educational jackpot
p31
aVin a voluntary desegregation program
p32
aVthat buses inner-city kids \u2014 black and brown \u2014
p33
aVout to suburban schools \u2014 rich and white.
p34
aa(lp35
VAt five years old, I had to take an hour-long bus ride
p36
aVto a faraway place
p37
aVto get a better education.
p38
aVAt five years old, I thought everyone had a life just like mine.
p39
aVI thought everyone went to school
p40
aVand were the only ones using the brown crayons
p41
aVto color in their family portraits,
p42
aVwhile everyone else was using the peach-colored ones.
p43
aVAt five years old, I thought everyone was just like me.
p44
aVBut as I got older, I started noticing things, like:
p45
aVHow come my neighborhood friend don't have to wake up
p46
aVat five o'clock in the morning,
p47
aVand go to a school that's an hour away?
p48
aVHow come I'm learning to play the violin
p49
aVwhile my neighborhood friends don't even have a music class?
p50
aVWhy were my neighborhood friends learning and reading material
p51
aVthat I had done two to three years prior?
p52
aa(lp53
VSee, as I got older,
p54
aVI started to have this unlawful feeling in my belly,
p55
aVlike I was doing something that I wasn't supposed to be doing;
p56
aVtaking something that wasn't mine;
p57
aVreceiving a gift,
p58
aVbut with someone else's name on it.
p59
aVAll these amazing things that I was being exposed to
p60
aVand experiencing,
p61
aVI felt I wasn't really supposed to have.
p62
aVI wasn't supposed to have a library, fully equipped athletic facilities,
p63
aVor safe fields to play in.
p64
aVI wasn't supposed to have theatre departments
p65
aVwith seasonal plays and concerts \u2014
p66
aVdigital, visual, performing arts.
p67
aVI wasn't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,
p68
aVschool buses that brought me door-to-door,
p69
aVfreshly prepared school lunches
p70
aVor even air conditioning.
p71
aVThese are things my kids don't get.
p72
aa(lp73
VYou see, as I got older,
p74
aVwhile I was grateful for this amazing opportunity
p75
aVthat I was being given,
p76
aVthere was this ever-present pang of:
p77
aVBut what about everyone else?
p78
aVThere are thousands of other kids just like me,
p79
aVwho deserve this, too.
p80
aVWhy doesn't everyone get this?
p81
aVWhy is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich?
p82
aa(lp83
VIt was like I had some sort of survivor's remorse.
p84
aVAll of my neighborhood friends were experiencing
p85
aVan educational train wreck
p86
aVthat I was saved from through a bus ride.
p87
aVI was like an educational Moses screaming,
p88
aV"Let my people go ...
p89
aVto high-quality schools!"
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VI'd seen firsthand how the other half was being treated and educated.
p94
aVI'd seen the educational promised land,
p95
aVand I could not for the life of me justify the disparity.
p96
aa(lp97
VI now teach in the very same school system from which I sought refuge.
p98
aVI know firsthand the tools that were given to me as a student,
p99
aVand now as a teacher, I don't have access to those same tools
p100
aVto give my students.
p101
aVThere have been countless nights when I've cried in frustration,
p102
aVanger
p103
aVand sorrow,
p104
aVbecause I can't teach my kids the way that I was taught,
p105
aVbecause I don't have access to the same resources or tools
p106
aVthat were used to teach me.
p107
aVMy kids deserve so much better.
p108
aa(lp109
VWe sit and we keep banging our heads against this term:
p110
aV"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"
p111
aVIs it really that hard to understand
p112
aVwhy these kids perform well and these kids don't?
p113
aVI mean, really.
p114
aVI think we've got it all wrong.
p115
aVI think we,
p116
aVas Gloria Ladson-Billings says,
p117
aVshould flip our paradigm and our language and call it what it really is.
p118
aVIt's not an achievement gap;
p119
aVit's an education debt,
p120
aVfor all of the foregone schooling resources that were never invested
p121
aVin the education of the black and brown child over time.
p122
aa(lp123
VA little-known secret in American history
p124
aVis that the only American institution created specifically for people of color
p125
aVis the American slave trade \u2014
p126
aVand some would argue the prison system,
p127
aVbut that's another topic for another TED Talk.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VThe public school system of this country was built, bought and paid for
p132
aVusing commerce generated from the slave trade and slave labor.
p133
aVWhile African-Americans were enslaved and prohibited from schooling,
p134
aVtheir labor established the very institution
p135
aVfrom which they were excluded.
p136
aVEver since then, every court case, educational policy, reform,
p137
aVhas been an attempt to retrofit the design,
p138
aVrather than just stopping and acknowledging:
p139
aVwe've had it all wrong from the beginning.
p140
aa(lp141
VAn oversimplification of American educational history.
p142
aVAll right, just bear with me.
p143
aVBlacks were kept out \u2014 you know, the whole slavery thing.
p144
aVWith the help of philanthropic white people,
p145
aVthey built their own schools.
p146
aVSeparate but equal was OK.
p147
aVBut while we all know things were indeed separate,
p148
aVthey were in no ways equal.
p149
aVEnter Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;
p150
aVlegal separation of the races is now illegal.
p151
aVBut very few people pay attention to all of the court cases since then,
p152
aVthat have undone the educational promised land for every child
p153
aVthat Brown v. Board intended.
p154
aVSome argue that today our schools are now more segregated
p155
aVthan they ever were before we tried to desegregate them in the first place.
p156
aa(lp157
VTeaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine,
p158
aVthe Civil Rights Movement,
p159
aVis a real awkward moment in my classroom,
p160
aVwhen I have to hear the voice of a child ask,
p161
aV"If schools were desegregated in 1954,
p162
aVhow come there are no white kids here?"
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VThese kids aren't dumb.
p167
aVThey know exactly what's happening,
p168
aVand what's not.
p169
aVThey know that when it comes to schooling,
p170
aVblack lives don't matter
p171
aVand they never have.
p172
aa(lp173
VFor years, I tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.
p174
aVI'd amassed a modest classroom library
p175
aVof books I'd accumulated from secondhand shops,
p176
aVthrift stores, attics \u2014 you know.
p177
aVBut whenever I said those dreadful words,
p178
aV"Take out a book and read,"
p179
aVyou'd think I'd just declared war.
p180
aVIt was torture.
p181
aVOne day,
p182
aVafter I'd heard about this website called DonorsChoose,
p183
aVwhere classroom teachers create wish lists
p184
aVof items they need for their classroom
p185
aVand anonymous donors fulfill them,
p186
aVI figured I'd go out on a limb and just make a wish list
p187
aVof the teenager's dream library.
p188
aVOver 200 brand-new books were sent to my room piece by piece.
p189
aVEvery day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee,
p190
aV"This feels like Christmas!"
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VThen they'd say,
p195
aV"Ms. Sumner, where did these books come from?"
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd then I'd reply,
p198
aV"Strangers from all over the country wanted you to have these."
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd then they'd say, almost suspiciously,
p201
aV"But they're brand-new."
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VTo which I'd reply,
p206
aV"You deserve brand-new books."
p207
aa(lp208
VThe whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls,
p209
aVas she peeled open a crisp paperback said,
p210
aV"Ms. Sumner \u2014 you know, I figured you bought these books,
p211
aV'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff.
p212
aVBut to know that a stranger, someone I don't even know,
p213
aVcares this much about me
p214
aVis pretty cool."
p215
aa(lp216
VKnowing that strangers will take care of you
p217
aVis a privilege my kids aren't afforded.
p218
aa(lp219
VEver since the donation,
p220
aVthere has been a steady stream of kids signing out books to take home,
p221
aVand then returning them with the exclamation,
p222
aV"This one was good!"
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter)
p225
aa(lp226
VNow when I say, "Take out a book and read,"
p227
aVkids rush to my library.
p228
aVIt wasn't that they didn't want to read,
p229
aVbut instead, they'd gladly read if the resources were there.
p230
aa(lp231
VInstitutionally speaking,
p232
aVour public school system has never done right by the black and brown child.
p233
aVWe keep focusing on the end results
p234
aVor test results,
p235
aVand getting frustrated.
p236
aVWe get to a catastrophe and we wonder,
p237
aV"How did it get so bad? How did we get here?"
p238
aVReally?
p239
aVIf you neglect a child long enough,
p240
aVyou no longer have the right to be surprised
p241
aVwhen things don't turn out well.
p242
aa(lp243
VStop being perplexed
p244
aVor confused
p245
aVor befuddled
p246
aVby the achievement gap,
p247
aVthe income gap,
p248
aVthe incarceration rates,
p249
aVor whatever socioeconomic disparity is the new "it" term for the moment.
p250
aVThe problems we have as a country
p251
aVare the problems we created as a country.
p252
aVThe quality of your education is directly proportionate
p253
aVto your access to college,
p254
aVyour access to jobs,
p255
aVyour access to the future.
p256
aa(lp257
VUntil we live in a world where every kid can get a high-quality education
p258
aVno matter where they live,
p259
aVor the color of their skin,
p260
aVthere are things we can do on a macro level.
p261
aVSchool funding should not be decided by property taxes
p262
aVor some funky economic equation
p263
aVwhere rich kids continue to benefit from state aid,
p264
aVwhile poor kids are continuously having food and resources
p265
aVtaken from their mouths.
p266
aVGovernors, senators, mayors, city council members \u2014
p267
aVif we're going to call public education public education,
p268
aVthen it should be just that.
p269
aVOtherwise, we should call it what it really is:
p270
aVpoverty insurance.
p271
aV"Public education:
p272
aVkeeping poor kids poor since 1954."
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VIf we really, as a country, believe that education is the "great equalizer,"
p277
aVthen it should be just that: equal and equitable.
p278
aVUntil then, there's no democracy in our democratic education.
p279
aa(lp280
VOn a mezzo level:
p281
aVhistorically speaking, the education of the black and brown child
p282
aVhas always depended on the philanthropy of others.
p283
aVAnd unfortunately, today it still does.
p284
aVIf your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor
p285
aVor little Timmy down the street
p286
aVgoes to an affluent school,
p287
aVchallenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school
p288
aVor an impoverished classroom.
p289
aVClose the divide by engaging in communication
p290
aVand relationships that matter.
p291
aVWhen resources are shared,
p292
aVthey're not divided;
p293
aVthey're multiplied.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd on a micro level:
p296
aVif you're a human being,
p297
aVdonate.
p298
aVTime, money, resources, opportunities \u2014
p299
aVwhatever is in your heart.
p300
aVThere are websites like DonorsChoose
p301
aVthat recognize the disparity
p302
aVand actually want to do something about it.
p303
aa(lp304
VWhat is a carpenter with no tools?
p305
aVWhat is an actress with no stage?
p306
aVWhat is a scientist with no laboratory?
p307
aVWhat is a doctor with no equipment?
p308
aVI'll tell you:
p309
aVthey're my kids.
p310
aVShouldn't they be your kids, too?
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.
