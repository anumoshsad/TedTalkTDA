(lp3
VSo, I have a strange career.
p4
aVI know it because people come up to me, like colleagues, and say,
p5
aV"Chris, you have a strange career."
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd I can see their point,
p10
aVbecause I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist.
p11
aVAnd I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions,
p12
aVand I was only 14 years old \u2014
p13
aVNo, no, I wasn't 14 years old.
p14
aVBut after that,
p15
aVI actually had my own lab
p16
aVin the Computational Neuroscience department,
p17
aVand I wasn't doing any neuroscience.
p18
aVLater, I would work on evolutionary genetics,
p19
aVand I would work on systems biology.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I'm going to tell you about something else today.
p22
aVI'm going to tell you about how I learned something about life.
p23
aVAnd I was actually a rocket scientist.
p24
aVI wasn't really a rocket scientist,
p25
aVbut I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
p26
aVin sunny California, where it's warm;
p27
aVwhereas now I am in the mid-West, and it's cold.
p28
aVBut it was an exciting experience.
p29
aVOne day, a NASA manager comes into my office,
p30
aVsits down and says,
p31
aV"Can you please tell us, how do we look for life outside Earth?"
p32
aVAnd that came as a surprise to me,
p33
aVbecause I was actually hired to work on quantum computation.
p34
aVYet, I had a very good answer.
p35
aVI said, "I have no idea."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd he told me, "Biosignatures, we need to look for a biosignature."
p40
aVAnd I said, "What is that?"
p41
aVAnd he said, "It's any measurable phenomenon
p42
aVthat allows us to indicate the presence of life."
p43
aVAnd I said, "Really?
p44
aVBecause isn't that easy?
p45
aVI mean, we have life.
p46
aVCan't you apply a definition,
p47
aVfor example, a Supreme Court-like definition of life?"
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd then I thought about it a little bit, and I said,
p50
aV"Well, is it really that easy?
p51
aVBecause, yes, if you see something like this,
p52
aVthen all right, fine, I'm going to call it life \u2014
p53
aVno doubt about it.
p54
aVBut here's something."
p55
aVAnd he goes, "Right, that's life too. I know that."
p56
aVExcept, if you think that life is also defined by things that die,
p57
aVyou're not in luck with this thing,
p58
aVbecause that's actually a very strange organism.
p59
aVIt grows up into the adult stage like that
p60
aVand then goes through a Benjamin Button phase,
p61
aVand actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again,
p62
aVand then actually grows back up, and back down and back up \u2014
p63
aVsort of yo-yo \u2014 and it never dies.
p64
aVSo it's actually life,
p65
aVbut it's actually not as we thought life would be.
p66
aVAnd then you see something like that.
p67
aVAnd he was like, "My God, what kind of a life form is that?"
p68
aVAnyone know?
p69
aVIt's actually not life, it's a crystal.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things \u2014
p72
aVso this particular person wrote a whole article and said,
p73
aV"Hey, these are bacteria."
p74
aVExcept, if you look a little bit closer,
p75
aVyou see, in fact, that this thing is way too small to be anything like that.
p76
aVSo he was convinced, but, in fact, most people aren't.
p77
aVAnd then, of course, NASA also had a big announcement,
p78
aVand President Clinton gave a press conference,
p79
aVabout this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite.
p80
aVExcept that nowadays, it's heavily disputed.
p81
aVIf you take the lesson of all these pictures,
p82
aVthen you realize, well, actually, maybe it's not that easy.
p83
aVMaybe I do need a definition of life
p84
aVin order to make that kind of distinction.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo can life be defined?
p87
aVWell how would you go about it?
p88
aVWell of course, you'd go to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
p89
aVNo, of course you don't do that; you put it somewhere in Google.
p90
aVAnd then you might get something.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd what you might get \u2014
p95
aVand anything that actually refers to things that we are used to,
p96
aVyou throw away.
p97
aVAnd then you might come up with something like this.
p98
aVAnd it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts.
p99
aVWho on Earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane?
p100
aVOh, it's actually a really, really, important set of concepts.
p101
aVSo I'm highlighting just a few words
p102
aVand saying definitions like that rely on things
p103
aVthat are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to,
p104
aVbut in fact on processes only.
p105
aVAnd if you take a look at that,
p106
aVthis was actually in a book that I wrote that deals with artificial life.
p107
aVAnd that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with.
p108
aVBecause the idea was that, with concepts like that,
p109
aVmaybe we can actually manufacture a form of life.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd so if you go and ask yourself, "What on Earth is artificial life?",
p112
aVlet me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.
p113
aVAnd it started out quite a while ago,
p114
aVwhen someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses.
p115
aVAnd for those of you who aren't old enough,
p116
aVyou have no idea how this infection was working \u2014
p117
aVnamely, through these floppy disks.
p118
aVBut the interesting thing about these computer virus infections
p119
aVwas that, if you look at the rate at which the infection worked,
p120
aVthey show this spiky behavior that you're used to from a flu virus.
p121
aVAnd it is in fact due to this arms race
p122
aVbetween hackers and operating system designers
p123
aVthat things go back and forth.
p124
aVAnd the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses,
p125
aVa phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life
p126
aVthat we're used to, at least on the viral level.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo is that life?
p129
aVNot as far as I'm concerned.
p130
aVWhy? Because these things don't evolve by themselves.
p131
aVIn fact, they have hackers writing them.
p132
aVBut the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further,
p133
aVwhen a scientist working at the Santa Fe Institute decided,
p134
aV"Why don't we try to package these little viruses
p135
aVin artificial worlds inside of the computer
p136
aVand let them evolve?"
p137
aVAnd this was Steen Rasmussen.
p138
aVAnd he designed this system, but it really didn't work,
p139
aVbecause his viruses were constantly destroying each other.
p140
aVBut there was another scientist who had been watching this, an ecologist.
p141
aVAnd he went home and says, "I know how to fix this."
p142
aVAnd he wrote the Tierra system,
p143
aVand, in my book,
p144
aVis in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems \u2014
p145
aVexcept for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo having seen this work, worked a little bit on this,
p148
aVthis is where I came in.
p149
aVAnd I decided to create a system that has all the properties
p150
aVthat are necessary to see, in fact, the evolution of complexity,
p151
aVmore and more complex problems constantly evolving.
p152
aVAnd of course, since I really don't know how to write code, I had help in this.
p153
aVI had two undergraduate students
p154
aVat California Institute of Technology that worked with me.
p155
aVThat's Charles Ofria on the left, Titus Brown on the right.
p156
aVThey are now, actually, respectable professors
p157
aVat Michigan State University,
p158
aVbut I can assure you, back in the day, we were not a respectable team.
p159
aVAnd I'm really happy that no photo survives
p160
aVof the three of us anywhere close together.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut what is this system like?
p163
aVWell I can't really go into the details,
p164
aVbut what you see here is some of the entrails.
p165
aVBut what I wanted to focus on is this type of population structure.
p166
aVThere's about 10,000 programs sitting here.
p167
aVAnd all different strains are colored in different colors.
p168
aVAnd as you see here, there are groups that are growing on top of each other,
p169
aVbecause they are spreading.
p170
aVAny time there is a program that's better at surviving in this world,
p171
aVdue to whatever mutation it has acquired,
p172
aVit is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo I'm going to show you a movie
p175
aVwhere you're going to see that kind of dynamic.
p176
aVAnd these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves.
p177
aVWe write our own stuff, replicate it, and are very proud of ourselves.
p178
aVAnd we put them in, and what you see immediately
p179
aVis that there are waves and waves of innovation.
p180
aVBy the way, this is highly accelerated,
p181
aVso it's like a 1000 generations a second.
p182
aVBut immediately, the system goes like, "What kind of dumb piece of code was this?
p183
aVThis can be improved upon in so many ways, so quickly."
p184
aVSo you see waves of new types taking over the other types.
p185
aVAnd this type of activity goes on for quite a while,
p186
aVuntil the main easy things have been acquired by these programs.
p187
aVAnd then, you see sort of like a stasis coming on
p188
aVwhere the system essentially waits
p189
aVfor a new type of innovation, like this one,
p190
aVwhich is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before
p191
aVand is erasing the genes that it had before,
p192
aVuntil a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved.
p193
aVAnd this process goes on and on and on.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo what we see here
p196
aVis a system that lives in very much the way we're used to how life goes.
p197
aVBut what the NASA people had asked me really was,
p198
aV"Do these guys have a biosignature?
p199
aVCan we measure this type of life?
p200
aVBecause if we can,
p201
aVmaybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else
p202
aVwithout being biased by things like amino acids."
p203
aVSo I said, "Well, perhaps we should construct a biosignature
p204
aVbased on life as a universal process.
p205
aVIn fact, it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed
p206
aVjust in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be."
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd the thing I came up with \u2014
p209
aVI have to first give you an introduction about the idea,
p210
aVand maybe that would be a meaning detector,
p211
aVrather than a life detector.
p212
aVAnd the way we would do that \u2014
p213
aVI would like to find out how I can distinguish text
p214
aVthat was written by a million monkeys, as opposed to text that is in our books.
p215
aVAnd I would like to do it in such a way
p216
aVthat I don't actually have to be able to read the language,
p217
aVbecause I'm sure I won't be able to.
p218
aVAs long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet.
p219
aVSo here would be a frequency plot
p220
aVof how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet
p221
aVin a text written by random monkeys.
p222
aVAnd obviously, each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut if you now look at the same distribution in English texts,
p225
aVit looks like that.
p226
aVAnd I'm telling you, this is very robust across English texts.
p227
aVAnd if I look at French texts, it looks a little bit different,
p228
aVor Italian or German.
p229
aVThey all have their own type of frequency distribution,
p230
aVbut it's robust.
p231
aVIt doesn't matter whether it writes about politics or about science.
p232
aVIt doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text.
p233
aVIt's a robust signature,
p234
aVand it's very stable.
p235
aVAs long as our books are written in English \u2014
p236
aVbecause people are rewriting them and recopying them \u2014
p237
aVit's going to be there.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo that inspired me to think about, well, what if I try to use this idea
p240
aVin order, not to detect random texts from texts with meaning,
p241
aVbut rather detect the fact that there is meaning
p242
aVin the biomolecules that make up life.
p243
aVBut first I have to ask:
p244
aVwhat are these building blocks,
p245
aVlike the alphabet, elements that I showed you?
p246
aVWell it turns out, we have many different alternatives
p247
aVfor such a set of building blocks.
p248
aVWe could use amino acids,
p249
aVwe could use nucleic acids, carboxylic acids, fatty acids.
p250
aVIn fact, chemistry's extremely rich, and our body uses a lot of them.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo that we actually, to test this idea,
p253
aVfirst took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids.
p254
aVAnd here's the result.
p255
aVHere is, in fact, what you get
p256
aVif you, for example, look at the distribution of amino acids
p257
aVon a comet or in interstellar space or, in fact, in a laboratory,
p258
aVwhere you made very sure that in your primordial soup,
p259
aVthere is no living stuff in there.
p260
aVWhat you find is mostly glycine and then alanine
p261
aVand there's some trace elements of the other ones.
p262
aVThat is also very robust \u2014
p263
aVwhat you find in systems like Earth
p264
aVwhere there are amino acids, but there is no life.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut suppose you take some dirt and dig through it
p267
aVand then put it into these spectrometers,
p268
aVbecause there's bacteria all over the place;
p269
aVor you take water anywhere on Earth,
p270
aVbecause it's teaming with life,
p271
aVand you make the same analysis;
p272
aVthe spectrum looks completely different.
p273
aVOf course, there is still glycine and alanine,
p274
aVbut in fact, there are these heavy elements, these heavy amino acids,
p275
aVthat are being produced because they are valuable to the organism.
p276
aVAnd some other ones that are not used in the set of 20,
p277
aVthey will not appear at all in any type of concentration.
p278
aVSo this also turns out to be extremely robust.
p279
aVIt doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up,
p280
aVwhether it's bacteria or any other plants or animals.
p281
aVAnywhere there's life,
p282
aVyou're going to have this distribution,
p283
aVas opposed to that distribution.
p284
aVAnd it is detectable not just in amino acids.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow you could ask:
p287
aVWell, what about these Avidians?
p288
aVThe Avidians being the denizens of this computer world
p289
aVwhere they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity.
p290
aVSo this is the distribution that you get if, in fact, there is no life.
p291
aVThey have about 28 of these instructions.
p292
aVAnd if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other,
p293
aVit's like the monkeys writing on a typewriter.
p294
aVEach of these instructions appears with roughly the equal frequency.
p295
aVBut if you now take a set of replicating guys
p296
aVlike in the video that you saw,
p297
aVit looks like this.
p298
aVSo there are some instructions
p299
aVthat are extremely valuable to these organisms,
p300
aVand their frequency is going to be high.
p301
aVAnd there's actually some instructions that you only use once, if ever.
p302
aVSo they are either poisonous
p303
aVor really should be used at less of a level than random.
p304
aVIn this case, the frequency is lower.
p305
aVAnd so now we can see, is that really a robust signature?
p306
aVI can tell you indeed it is,
p307
aVbecause this type of spectrum, just like what you've seen in books,
p308
aVand just like what you've seen in amino acids,
p309
aVit doesn't really matter how you change the environment,
p310
aVit's very robust, it's going to reflect the environment.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did.
p313
aVAnd I have to explain to you,
p314
aVthe top of this graph
p315
aVshows you that frequency distribution that I talked about.
p316
aVHere, that's the lifeless environment
p317
aVwhere each instruction occurs at an equal frequency.
p318
aVAnd below there, I show, in fact, the mutation rate in the environment.
p319
aVAnd I'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high
p320
aVthat even if you would drop a replicating program
p321
aVthat would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world,
p322
aVif you drop it in, it gets mutated to death immediately.
p323
aVSo there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate.
p324
aVBut then I'm going to slowly turn down the heat, so to speak,
p325
aVand then there's this viability threshold
p326
aVwhere now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live.
p327
aVAnd indeed, we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo let's see what that looks like.
p330
aVSo first, nothing, nothing, nothing.
p331
aVToo hot, too hot.
p332
aVNow the viability threshold is reached,
p333
aVand the frequency distribution has dramatically changed
p334
aVand, in fact, stabilizes.
p335
aVAnd now what I did there
p336
aVis, I was being nasty, I just turned up the heat again and again.
p337
aVAnd of course, it reaches the viability threshold.
p338
aVAnd I'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice.
p339
aVYou hit the viability threshold.
p340
aVThe distribution changes to "alive!"
p341
aVAnd then, once you hit the threshold
p342
aVwhere the mutation rate is so high that you cannot self-reproduce,
p343
aVyou cannot copy the information forward to your offspring
p344
aVwithout making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes.
p345
aVAnd then, that signature is lost.
p346
aa(lp347
VWhat do we learn from that?
p348
aVWell, I think we learn a number of things from that.
p349
aVOne of them is,
p350
aVif we are able to think about life in abstract terms \u2014
p351
aVand we're not talking about things like plants,
p352
aVand we're not talking about amino acids,
p353
aVand we're not talking about bacteria,
p354
aVbut we think in terms of processes \u2014
p355
aVthen we could start to think about life
p356
aVnot as something that is so special to Earth,
p357
aVbut that, in fact, could exist anywhere.
p358
aVBecause it really only has to do with these concepts of information,
p359
aVof storing information within physical substrates \u2014
p360
aVanything: bits, nucleic acids, anything that's an alphabet \u2014
p361
aVand make sure that there's some process
p362
aVso that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect \u2014
p363
aVthe time scales for the deterioration of information.
p364
aVAnd if you can do that, then you have life.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo the first thing that we learn
p367
aVis that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone,
p368
aVwithout referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear,
p369
aVas far as the type of life on Earth is.
p370
aVAnd that, in a sense, removes us again,
p371
aVlike all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them \u2014
p372
aVit's this continuous dethroning of man \u2014
p373
aVof how we think we're special because we're alive.
p374
aVWell, we can make life; we can make life in the computer.
p375
aVGranted, it's limited,
p376
aVbut we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.
p377
aVAnd once we have that,
p378
aVthen it is not such a difficult task anymore
p379
aVto say, if we understand the fundamental processes
p380
aVthat do not refer to any particular substrate,
p381
aVthen we can go out and try other worlds,
p382
aVfigure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be,
p383
aVfigure enough about the normal chemistry, the geochemistry of the planet,
p384
aVso that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life,
p385
aVand then look for large deviations from this \u2014
p386
aVthis thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."
p387
aVNow we don't know that there's life then,
p388
aVbut we could say,
p389
aV"Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical
p390
aVand see where it comes from."
p391
aVAnd that might be our chance of actually discovering life
p392
aVwhen we cannot visibly see it.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you.
p395
aVLife can be less mysterious than we make it out to be
p396
aVwhen we try to think about how it would be on other planets.
p397
aVAnd if we remove the mystery of life,
p398
aVthen I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live,
p399
aVand how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.
p400
aVAnd I'm going to leave you with that.
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd thank you very much.
