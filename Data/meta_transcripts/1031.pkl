VI grew up in New York City,
p4
aVbetween Harlem and the Bronx.
p5
aVGrowing up as a boy, we were taught
p6
aVthat men had to be tough, had to be strong,
p7
aVhad to be courageous, dominating \u2014
p8
aVno pain, no emotions,
p9
aVwith the exception of anger \u2014
p10
aVand definitely no fear;
p11
aVthat men are in charge,
p12
aVwhich means women are not;
p13
aVthat men lead,
p14
aVand you should just follow and do what we say;
p15
aVthat men are superior; women are inferior;
p16
aVthat men are strong; women are weak;
p17
aVthat women are of less value,
p18
aVproperty of men,
p19
aVand objects,
p20
aVparticularly sexual objects.
p21
aVI've later come to know that to be
p22
aVthe collective socialization of men,
p23
aVbetter known
p24
aVas the "man box."
p25
aVSee this man box has in it
p26
aVall the ingredients
p27
aVof how we define what it means to be a man.
p28
aVNow I also want to say, without a doubt,
p29
aVthere are some wonderful, wonderful,
p30
aVabsolutely wonderful things
p31
aVabout being a man.
p32
aVBut at the same time,
p33
aVthere's some stuff
p34
aVthat's just straight up twisted,
p35
aVand we really need to begin
p36
aVto challenge, look at it
p37
aVand really get in the process
p38
aVof deconstructing, redefining,
p39
aVwhat we come to know as manhood.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
p42
aVThey're 11 and 12.
p43
aVKendall's 15 months older than Jay.
p44
aVThere was a period of time when my wife \u2014 her name is Tammie \u2014 and I,
p45
aVwe just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:
p46
aVKendall and Jay.
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVAnd when they were about five and six,
p49
aVfour and five,
p50
aVJay could come to me,
p51
aVcome to me crying.
p52
aVIt didn't matter what she was crying about,
p53
aVshe could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,
p54
aVjust cry, cry it out.
p55
aVDaddy's got you. That's all that's important.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow Kendall on the other hand \u2014
p58
aVand like I said, he's only 15 months older than her \u2014
p59
aVhe'd come to me crying,
p60
aVit's like as soon as I would hear him cry,
p61
aVa clock would go off.
p62
aVI would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,
p63
aVwhich means, by the time he got to me,
p64
aVI was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
p65
aVHold your head up. Look at me.
p66
aVExplain to me what's wrong.
p67
aVTell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
p68
aVWhy are you crying?"
p69
aVAnd out of my own frustration
p70
aVof my role and responsibility
p71
aVof building him up as a man
p72
aVto fit into these guidelines
p73
aVand these structures that are defining this man box,
p74
aVI would find myself saying things like,
p75
aV"Just go in your room.
p76
aVJust go on, go on in your room.
p77
aVSit down,
p78
aVget yourself together
p79
aVand come back and talk to me
p80
aVwhen you can talk to me like a \u2014" what?
p81
aV(Audience: Man.)
p82
aVLike a man.
p83
aVAnd he's five years old.
p84
aVAnd as I grow in life,
p85
aVI would say to myself,
p86
aV"My God, what's wrong with me?
p87
aVWhat am I doing? Why would I do this?"
p88
aVAnd I think back.
p89
aVI think back to my father.
p90
aa(lp91
VThere was a time in my life
p92
aVwhere we had a very troubled experience in our family.
p93
aVMy brother, Henry, he died tragically
p94
aVwhen we were teenagers.
p95
aVWe lived in New York City, as I said.
p96
aVWe lived in the Bronx at the time,
p97
aVand the burial was in a place called Long Island,
p98
aVit was about two hours outside of the city.
p99
aVAnd as we were preparing
p100
aVto come back from the burial,
p101
aVthe cars stopped at the bathroom
p102
aVto let folks take care of themselves
p103
aVbefore the long ride back to the city.
p104
aVAnd the limousine empties out.
p105
aVMy mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,
p106
aVbut my father and I stayed in the limousine,
p107
aVand no sooner than the women got out,
p108
aVhe burst out crying.
p109
aVHe didn't want cry in front of me,
p110
aVbut he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,
p111
aVand it was better me than to allow himself
p112
aVto express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
p113
aVAnd this is a man
p114
aVwho, 10 minutes ago,
p115
aVhad just put his teenage son
p116
aVin the ground \u2014
p117
aVsomething I just can't even imagine.
p118
aVThe thing that sticks with me the most
p119
aVis that he was apologizing to me
p120
aVfor crying in front of me,
p121
aVand at the same time, he was also giving me props,
p122
aVlifting me up,
p123
aVfor not crying.
p124
aa(lp125
VI come to also look at this
p126
aVas this fear that we have as men,
p127
aVthis fear that just has us paralyzed,
p128
aVholding us hostage
p129
aVto this man box.
p130
aVI can remember speaking
p131
aVto a 12-year-old boy, a football player,
p132
aVand I asked him, I said,
p133
aV"How would you feel if,
p134
aVin front of all the players,
p135
aVyour coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
p136
aVNow I expected him to say something like,
p137
aVI'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
p138
aVNo, the boy said to me \u2014
p139
aVthe boy said to me,
p140
aV"It would destroy me."
p141
aVAnd I said to myself,
p142
aV"God, if it would destroy him
p143
aVto be called a girl,
p144
aVwhat are we then teaching him
p145
aVabout girls?"
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VIt took me back to a time
p150
aVwhen I was about 12 years old.
p151
aVI grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
p152
aVAt this time we're living in the Bronx,
p153
aVand in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
p154
aVHe was about 16 years old,
p155
aVand we were all about 12 years old \u2014 younger guys.
p156
aVAnd he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
p157
aVAnd this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
p158
aVHe was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,
p159
aV"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
p160
aVAnd he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
p161
aVHe was a troubled kid.
p162
aVHis mother had died from a heroin overdose.
p163
aVHe was being raised by his grandmother.
p164
aVHis father wasn't on the set.
p165
aVHis grandmother had two jobs.
p166
aVHe was home alone a lot.
p167
aVBut I've got to tell you, we young guys,
p168
aVwe looked up to this dude, man.
p169
aVHe was cool. He was fine.
p170
aVThat's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
p171
aVHe was having sex.
p172
aVWe all looked up to him.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something \u2014
p175
aVjust playing around, doing something \u2014 I don't know what.
p176
aVHe looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
p177
aVThey called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
p178
aV"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
p179
aVJohnny call, you go.
p180
aVSo I run right upstairs.
p181
aVAs he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
p182
aVNow I immediately knew what he meant.
p183
aVBecause for me growing up at that time,
p184
aVand our relationship with this man box,
p185
aV"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:
p186
aVsex or drugs \u2014
p187
aVand we weren't doing drugs.
p188
aVNow my box, my card,
p189
aVmy man box card,
p190
aVwas immediately in jeopardy.
p191
aVTwo things: One, I never had sex.
p192
aVWe don't talk about that as men.
p193
aVYou only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,
p194
aVthe first time you had sex.
p195
aVFor everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
p196
aVThere ain't no first time.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVThe other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
p199
aVThat's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
p200
aVWomen are objects,
p201
aVespecially sexual objects.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
p204
aVSo, like my mother would say, make a long story short,
p205
aVI just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
p206
aVHe told me to go in his room.
p207
aVI go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
p208
aVShe's 16 years old.
p209
aVShe's nude.
p210
aVShe's what I know today to be mentally ill,
p211
aVhigher-functioning at times than others.
p212
aVWe had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
p213
aVAnyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
p214
aVWell actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
p215
aVBecause, while Sheila never said no,
p216
aVshe also never said yes.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.
p219
aVSo when I go in the room, I close the door.
p220
aVFolks, I'm petrified.
p221
aVI stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room
p222
aVand see that I'm not doing anything,
p223
aVand I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
p224
aVSo now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;
p225
aVI'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
p226
aVSo in my 12 years of wisdom,
p227
aVI zip my pants down,
p228
aVI walk out into the room,
p229
aVand lo and behold to me,
p230
aVwhile I was in the room with Sheila,
p231
aVJohnny was back at the window calling guys up.
p232
aVSo now there's a living room full of guys.
p233
aVIt was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
p234
aVAnd they asked me how was it,
p235
aVand I say to them, "It was good,"
p236
aVand I zip my pants up in front of them,
p237
aVand I head for the door.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow I say this all with remorse,
p240
aVand I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,
p241
aVbut I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,
p242
aVbecause I didn't get caught.
p243
aVBut I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
p244
aVThis fear, getting outside the man box,
p245
aVtotally enveloped me.
p246
aVIt was way more important to me,
p247
aVabout me and my man box card
p248
aVthan about Sheila
p249
aVand what was happening to her.
p250
aa(lp251
VSee collectively, we as men
p252
aVare taught to have less value in women,
p253
aVto view them as property and the objects of men.
p254
aVWe see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
p255
aVWe as men, good men,
p256
aVthe large majority of men,
p257
aVwe operate on the foundation
p258
aVof this whole collective socialization.
p259
aVWe kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
p260
aVYou see, we have to come to understand
p261
aVthat less value, property and objectification is the foundation
p262
aVand the violence can't happen without it.
p263
aVSo we're very much a part of the solution
p264
aVas well as the problem.
p265
aVThe center for disease control says
p266
aVthat men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,
p267
aVis the number one health concern for women
p268
aVin this country and abroad.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo quickly, I'd like to just say,
p271
aVthis is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
p272
aVThe world I envision for her \u2014
p273
aVhow do I want men to be acting and behaving?
p274
aVI need you on board. I need you with me.
p275
aVI need you working with me and me working with you
p276
aVon how we raise our sons
p277
aVand teach them to be men \u2014
p278
aVthat it's okay to not be dominating,
p279
aVthat it's okay to have feelings and emotions,
p280
aVthat it's okay to promote equality,
p281
aVthat it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,
p282
aVthat it's okay to be whole,
p283
aVthat my liberation as a man
p284
aVis tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)
p285
aa(lp286
VI remember asking a nine-year-old boy,
p287
aVI asked a nine-year-old boy,
p288
aV"What would life be like for you,
p289
aVif you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
p290
aVHe said to me, "I would be free."
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you folks.
