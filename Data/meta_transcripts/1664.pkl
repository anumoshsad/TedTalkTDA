VIn my previous life, I was an artist.
p4
aVI still paint. I love art.
p5
aVI love the joy that color can give to our lives
p6
aVand to our communities,
p7
aVand I try to bring something of the artist in me
p8
aVin my politics,
p9
aVand I see
p10
aVpart of my job today, the reason for being here,
p11
aVnot just to campaign for my party,
p12
aVbut for politics, and the role it can play
p13
aVfor the better in our lives.
p14
aa(lp15
VFor 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
p16
aVWe faced many challenges.
p17
aVArt was part of the answer,
p18
aVand my name, in the very beginning,
p19
aVwas linked with two things:
p20
aVdemolition of illegal constructions
p21
aVin order to get public space back,
p22
aVand use of colors in order to revive the hope
p23
aVthat had been lost in my city.
p24
aVBut this use of colors was not just an artistic act.
p25
aVRather, it was a form of political action
p26
aVin a context when the city budget I had available
p27
aVafter being elected amounted to zero comma something.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen we painted the first building,
p30
aVby splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray
p31
aVof a facade,
p32
aVsomething unimaginable happened.
p33
aVThere was a traffic jam
p34
aVand a crowd of people gathered
p35
aVas if it were the location of some spectacular accident,
p36
aVor the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.
p37
aa(lp38
VThe French E.U. official in charge of the funding
p39
aVrushed to block the painting.
p40
aVHe screeched that he would block the financing.
p41
aa(lp42
V"But why?" I asked him.
p43
aa(lp44
V"Because the colors you have ordered
p45
aVdo not meet European standards," he replied.
p46
aa(lp47
V"Well," I told him,
p48
aV"the surroundings do not meet European standards,
p49
aVeven though this is not what we want,
p50
aVbut we will choose the colors ourselves,
p51
aVbecause this is exactly what we want.
p52
aVAnd if you do not let us continue with our work,
p53
aVI will hold a press conference here,
p54
aVright now, right in this road,
p55
aVand we will tell people that you look to me
p56
aVjust like the censors of the socialist realism era."
p57
aa(lp58
VThen he was kind of troubled,
p59
aVand asked me for a compromise.
p60
aVBut I told him no, I'm sorry,
p61
aVcompromise in colors is gray,
p62
aVand we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
p63
aV(Applause)
p64
aVSo it's time for change.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe rehabilitation of public spaces
p67
aVrevived the feeling of belonging
p68
aVto a city that people lost.
p69
aVThe pride of people about their own place of living,
p70
aVand there were feelings that had been buried
p71
aVdeep for years under the fury of the illegal,
p72
aVbarbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.
p73
aVAnd when colors came out everywhere,
p74
aVa mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.
p75
aVBig noise raised up: "What is this? What is happening?
p76
aVWhat are colors doing to us?"
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd we made a poll,
p79
aVthe most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
p80
aVWe asked people, "Do you want this action,
p81
aVand to have buildings painted like that?"
p82
aVAnd then the second question was,
p83
aV"Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
p84
aVTo the first question,
p85
aV63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
p86
aVThirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
p87
aVBut to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,
p88
aVthey wanted it to continue. (Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we noticed change.
p91
aVPeople started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,
p92
aVstarted to pay taxes,
p93
aVstarted to feel something they had forgotten,
p94
aVand beauty was acting as a guardsman
p95
aVwhere municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.
p96
aa(lp97
VOne day I remember walking along a street
p98
aVthat had just been colored,
p99
aVand where we were in the process of planting trees,
p100
aVwhen I saw a shopkeeper and his wife
p101
aVputting a glass facade to their shop.
p102
aVThey had thrown the old shutter
p103
aVin the garbage collection place.
p104
aa(lp105
V"Why did you throw away the shutters?" I asked him.
p106
aa(lp107
V"Well, because the street is safer now," they answered.
p108
aa(lp109
V"Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"
p110
aa(lp111
V"Come on, man! What policemen?
p112
aVYou can see it for yourself. There are colors,
p113
aVstreetlights, new pavement with no potholes,
p114
aVtrees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd indeed, it was beauty that was giving people
p117
aVthis feeling of being protected.
p118
aVAnd this was not a misplaced feeling.
p119
aVCrime did fall.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe freedom that was won in 1990
p122
aVbrought about a state of anarchy in the city,
p123
aVwhile the barbarism of the '90s
p124
aVbrought about a loss of hope for the city.
p125
aVThe paint on the walls did not feed children,
p126
aVnor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,
p127
aVbut it gave hope and light,
p128
aVand helped to make people see
p129
aVthere could be a different way of doing things,
p130
aVa different spirit, a different feel to our lives,
p131
aVand that if we brought the same energy and hope
p132
aVto our politics, we could build a better life
p133
aVfor each other and for our country.
p134
aVWe removed 123,000 tons of concrete
p135
aVonly from the riverbanks.
p136
aVWe demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings
p137
aVall over the city,
p138
aVup to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
p139
aVWe planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
p140
aVWe established a green tax,
p141
aVand then everybody accepted it
p142
aVand all businessmen paid it regularly.
p143
aVBy means of open competitions,
p144
aVwe managed to recruit in our administration
p145
aVmany young people,
p146
aVand we thus managed to build
p147
aVa de-politicized public institution
p148
aVwhere men and women were equally represented.
p149
aa(lp150
VInternational organizations
p151
aVhave invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,
p152
aVnot all of it well spent.
p153
aVWhen I told the World Bank directors
p154
aVthat I wanted them to finance a project to build
p155
aVa model reception hall for citizens
p156
aVprecisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,
p157
aVthey did not understand me.
p158
aVBut people were waiting in long queues
p159
aVunder sun and under rain
p160
aVin order to get a certificate or just a simple answer
p161
aVfrom two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.
p162
aVThey were paying in order to skip the queue,
p163
aVthe long queue.
p164
aVThe reply to their requests was met
p165
aVby a voice coming from this dark hole,
p166
aVand, on the other hand,
p167
aVa mysterious hand coming out to take their documents
p168
aVwhile searching through old documents for the bribe.
p169
aVWe could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,
p170
aVevery week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.
p171
aa(lp172
V"I'm convinced," I told a German official
p173
aVwith the World Bank,
p174
aV"that it would be impossible for them to be bribed
p175
aVif they worked in Germany,
p176
aVin a German administration,
p177
aVjust as I am convinced that if you put German officials
p178
aVfrom the German administration in those holes,
p179
aVthey would be bribed just the same."
p180
aa(lp181
V(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VIt's not about genes.
p184
aVIt's not about some being with a high conscience
p185
aVand some others having not a conscience.
p186
aVIt's about system, it's about organization.
p187
aVIt's also about environment and respect.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe removed the kiosks.
p190
aVWe built the bright new reception hall
p191
aVthat made people, Tirana citizens,
p192
aVthink they had traveled abroad when they entered
p193
aVto make their requests.
p194
aVWe created an online system of control
p195
aVand so speeded up all the processes.
p196
aVWe put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
p197
aa(lp198
VThe corruption in the state administration
p199
aVof countries like Albania \u2014
p200
aVit's not up to me to say also like Greece \u2014
p201
aVcan be fought only by modernization.
p202
aVReinventing the government by reinventing politics itself
p203
aVis the answer, and not reinventing people
p204
aVbased on a ready-made formula
p205
aVthat the developed world often tries in vain to impose
p206
aVto people like us.
p207
aV(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VThings have come to this point
p210
aVbecause politicians in general,
p211
aVbut especially in our countries, let's face it,
p212
aVthink people are stupid.
p213
aVThey take it for granted that, come what may,
p214
aVpeople have to follow them,
p215
aVwhile politics, more and more, fails to offer answers
p216
aVfor their public concerns
p217
aVor the exigencies of the common people.
p218
aVPolitics has come to resemble
p219
aVa cynical team game played by politicians,
p220
aVwhile the public has been pushed aside
p221
aVas if sitting on the seats of a stadium
p222
aVin which passion for politics
p223
aVis gradually making room for blindness and desperation.
p224
aVSeen from those stairs, all politicians today
p225
aVseem the same,
p226
aVand politics has come to resemble
p227
aVa sport that inspires more aggressiveness
p228
aVand pessimism than social cohesion
p229
aVand the desire for civic protaganism.
p230
aa(lp231
VBarack Obama won
p232
aV\u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p233
aVbecause he mobilized people as never before
p234
aVthrough the use of social networks.
p235
aVHe did not know each and every one of them,
p236
aVbut with an admirable ingenuity,
p237
aVhe managed to transform them into activists
p238
aVby giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands
p239
aVthe arguments and the instruments that each would need
p240
aVto campaign in his name by making his own campaign.
p241
aVI tweet. I love it.
p242
aVI love it because it lets me get the message out,
p243
aVbut it also lets people get their messages to me.
p244
aVThis is politics, not from top down,
p245
aVbut from the bottom up, and sideways,
p246
aVand allowing everybody's voice to be heard
p247
aVis exactly what we need.
p248
aVPolitics is not just about leaders.
p249
aVIt's not just about politicians and laws.
p250
aVIt is about how people think,
p251
aVhow they view the world around them,
p252
aVhow they use their time and their energy.
p253
aVWhen people say all politicians are the same,
p254
aVask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,
p255
aVif François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.
p256
aVThey are not. They are human beings with different views
p257
aVand different visions for the world.
p258
aVWhen people say nothing can change,
p259
aVjust stop and think what the world was like
p260
aV10, 20, 50, 100 years ago.
p261
aVOur world is defined by the pace of change.
p262
aVWe can all change the world.
p263
aa(lp264
VI gave you a very small example
p265
aVof how one thing, the use of color,
p266
aVcan make change happen.
p267
aVI want to make more change
p268
aVas Prime Minister of my country,
p269
aVbut every single one of you can make change happen
p270
aVif you want to.
