VSo you probably have the sense, as most people do,
p4
aVthat polarization is getting worse in our country,
p5
aVthat the divide between the left and the right
p6
aVis as bad as it's been in really any of our lifetimes.
p7
aVBut you might also reasonably wonder if research backs up your intuition.
p8
aVAnd in a nutshell, the answer is sadly yes.
p9
aVIn study after study, we find
p10
aVthat liberals and conservatives have grown further apart.
p11
aVThey increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos,
p12
aVconsuming different news, talking only to like-minded others
p13
aVand more and more choosing to live in different parts of the country.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd I think that most alarming of all of it
p16
aVis seeing this rising animosity on both sides.
p17
aVLiberals and conservatives,
p18
aVDemocrats and Republicans,
p19
aVmore and more they just don't like one another.
p20
aVYou see it in many different ways.
p21
aVThey don't want to befriend one another. They don't want to date one another.
p22
aVIf they do, if they find out, they find each other less attractive,
p23
aVand they more and more don't want their children to marry someone
p24
aVwho supports the other party,
p25
aVa particularly shocking statistic.
p26
aa(lp27
VYou know, in my lab, the students that I work with,
p28
aVwe're talking about some sort of social pattern \u2014
p29
aVI'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like,
p30
aVwhat kind of movie are we in here with this pattern?
p31
aVSo what kind of movie are we in with political polarization?
p32
aVWell, it could be a disaster movie.
p33
aVIt certainly seems like a disaster.
p34
aVCould be a war movie.
p35
aVAlso fits.
p36
aVBut what I keep thinking is that we're in a zombie apocalypse movie.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VRight? You know the kind.
p41
aVThere's people wandering around in packs,
p42
aVnot thinking for themselves,
p43
aVseized by this mob mentality
p44
aVtrying to spread their disease and destroy society.
p45
aVAnd you probably think, as I do,
p46
aVthat you're the good guy in the zombie apocalypse movie,
p47
aVand all this hate and polarization, it's being propagated by the other people,
p48
aVbecause we're Brad Pitt, right?
p49
aVFree-thinking, righteous,
p50
aVjust trying to hold on to what we hold dear,
p51
aVyou know, not foot soldiers in the army of the undead.
p52
aVNot that.
p53
aVNever that.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut here's the thing:
p56
aVwhat movie do you suppose they think they're in?
p57
aVRight?
p58
aVWell, they absolutely think that they're the good guys
p59
aVin the zombie apocalypse movie. Right?
p60
aVAnd you'd better believe that they think that they're Brad Pitt
p61
aVand that we, we are the zombies.
p62
aVAnd who's to say that they're wrong?
p63
aVI think that the truth is that we're all a part of this.
p64
aVAnd the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solution.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what are we going to do?
p67
aVWhat can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life?
p68
aVWhat could we do to connect with and communicate with
p69
aVour political counterparts?
p70
aVWell, these were exactly the questions that I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg,
p71
aVbecame fascinated with a few years ago,
p72
aVand we started doing research on this topic.
p73
aVAnd one of the first things that we discovered
p74
aVthat I think is really helpful for understanding polarization
p75
aVis to understand
p76
aVthat the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo one of the most robust findings in the history of political psychology
p79
aVis this pattern identified by Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham,
p80
aVpsychologists,
p81
aVthat liberals and conservatives tend to endorse different values
p82
aVto different degrees.
p83
aVSo for example, we find that liberals tend to endorse values like equality
p84
aVand fairness and care and protection from harm
p85
aVmore than conservatives do.
p86
aVAnd conservatives tend to endorse values like loyalty, patriotism,
p87
aVrespect for authority and moral purity
p88
aVmore than liberals do.
p89
aVAnd Matt and I were thinking that maybe this moral divide
p90
aVmight be helpful for understanding how it is
p91
aVthat liberals and conservatives talk to one another
p92
aVand why they so often seem to talk past one another
p93
aVwhen they do.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo we conducted a study
p96
aVwhere we recruited liberals to a study
p97
aVwhere they were supposed to write a persuasive essay
p98
aVthat would be compelling to a conservative in support of same-sex marriage.
p99
aVAnd what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments
p100
aVin terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness.
p101
aVSo they said things like,
p102
aV"Everyone should have the right to love whoever they choose,"
p103
aVand, "They" \u2014 they being gay Americans \u2014
p104
aV"deserve the same equal rights as other Americans."
p105
aVOverall, we found that 69 percent of liberals
p106
aVinvoked one of the more liberal moral values in constructing their essay,
p107
aVand only nine percent invoked one of the more conservative moral values,
p108
aVeven though they were supposed to be trying to persuade conservatives.
p109
aVAnd when we studied conservatives and had them make persuasive arguments
p110
aVin support of making English the official language of the US,
p111
aVa classically conservative political position,
p112
aVwe found that they weren't much better at this.
p113
aV59 percent of them made arguments
p114
aVin terms of one of the more conservative moral values,
p115
aVand just eight percent invoked a liberal moral value,
p116
aVeven though they were supposed to be targeting liberals for persuasion.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, you can see right away why we're in trouble here. Right?
p119
aVPeople's moral values, they're their most deeply held beliefs.
p120
aVPeople are willing to fight and die for their values.
p121
aVWhy are they going to give that up just to agree with you
p122
aVon something that they don't particularly want to agree with you on anyway?
p123
aVIf that persuasive appeal that you're making to your Republican uncle
p124
aVmeans that he doesn't just have to change his view,
p125
aVhe's got to change his underlying values, too,
p126
aVthat's not going to go very far.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo what would work better?
p129
aVWell, we believe it's a technique that we call moral reframing,
p130
aVand we've studied it in a series of experiments.
p131
aVIn one of these experiments,
p132
aVwe recruited liberals and conservatives to a study
p133
aVwhere they read one of three essays
p134
aVbefore having their environmental attitudes surveyed.
p135
aVAnd the first of these essays
p136
aVwas a relatively conventional pro-environmental essay
p137
aVthat invoked the liberal values of care and protection from harm.
p138
aVIt said things like, "In many important ways
p139
aVwe are causing real harm to the places we live in,"
p140
aVand, "It is essential that we take steps now
p141
aVto prevent further destruction from being done to our Earth."
p142
aVAnother group of participants
p143
aVwere assigned to read a really different essay
p144
aVthat was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purity.
p145
aVIt was a pro-environmental essay as well,
p146
aVand it said things like,
p147
aV"Keeping our forests, drinking water, and skies pure is of vital importance."
p148
aV"We should regard the pollution
p149
aVof the places we live in to be disgusting."
p150
aVAnd, "Reducing pollution can help us preserve
p151
aVwhat is pure and beautiful about the places we live."
p152
aVAnd then we had a third group
p153
aVthat were assigned to read just a nonpolitical essay.
p154
aVIt was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd what we found when we surveyed people
p157
aVabout their environmental attitudes afterwards,
p158
aVwe found that liberals, it didn't matter what essay they read.
p159
aVThey tended to have highly pro-environmental attitudes regardless.
p160
aVLiberals are on board for environmental protection.
p161
aVConservatives, however,
p162
aVwere significantly more supportive of progressive environmental policies
p163
aVand environmental protection
p164
aVif they had read the moral purity essay
p165
aVthan if they read one of the other two essays.
p166
aVWe even found that conservatives who read the moral purity essay
p167
aVwere significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming
p168
aVand were concerned about global warming,
p169
aVeven though this essay didn't even mention global warming.
p170
aVThat's just a related environmental issue.
p171
aVBut that's how robust this moral reframing effect was.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd we've studied this on a whole slew of different political issues.
p174
aVSo if you want to move conservatives
p175
aVon issues like same-sex marriage or national health insurance,
p176
aVit helps to tie these liberal political issues to conservative values
p177
aVlike patriotism and moral purity.
p178
aVAnd we studied it the other way, too.
p179
aVIf you want to move liberals to the right on conservative policy issues
p180
aVlike military spending and making English the official language of the US,
p181
aVyou're going to be more persuasive
p182
aVif you tie those conservative policy issues to liberal moral values
p183
aVlike equality and fairness.
p184
aa(lp185
VAll these studies have the same clear message:
p186
aVif you want to persuade someone on some policy,
p187
aVit's helpful to connect that policy to their underlying moral values.
p188
aVAnd when you say it like that
p189
aVit seems really obvious. Right?
p190
aVLike, why did we come here tonight?
p191
aVWhy \u2014
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VIt's incredibly intuitive.
p196
aVAnd even though it is, it's something we really struggle to do.
p197
aVYou know, it turns out that when we go to persuade somebody on a political issue,
p198
aVwe talk like we're speaking into a mirror.
p199
aVWe don't persuade so much as we rehearse our own reasons
p200
aVfor why we believe some sort of political position.
p201
aVWe kept saying when we were designing these reframed moral arguments,
p202
aV"Empathy and respect, empathy and respect."
p203
aVIf you can tap into that,
p204
aVyou can connect
p205
aVand you might be able to persuade somebody in this country.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo thinking again
p208
aVabout what movie we're in,
p209
aVmaybe I got carried away before.
p210
aVMaybe it's not a zombie apocalypse movie.
p211
aVMaybe instead it's a buddy cop movie.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VJust roll with it, just go with it please.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VYou know the kind: there's a white cop and a black cop,
p220
aVor maybe a messy cop and an organized cop.
p221
aVWhatever it is, they don't get along
p222
aVbecause of this difference.
p223
aVBut in the end, when they have to come together and they cooperate,
p224
aVthe solidarity that they feel,
p225
aVit's greater because of that gulf that they had to cross. Right?
p226
aVAnd remember that in these movies,
p227
aVit's usually worst in the second act
p228
aVwhen our leads are further apart than ever before.
p229
aVAnd so maybe that's where we are in this country,
p230
aVlate in the second act of a buddy cop movie \u2014
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
Vtorn apart but about to come back together.
p235
aVIt sounds good,
p236
aVbut if we want it to happen,
p237
aVI think the responsibility is going to start with us.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo this is my call to you:
p240
aVlet's put this country back together.
p241
aVLet's do it despite the politicians
p242
aVand the media and Facebook and Twitter
p243
aVand Congressional redistricting
p244
aVand all of it, all the things that divide us.
p245
aVLet's do it because it's right.
p246
aVAnd let's do it because this hate and contempt
p247
aVthat flows through all of us every day
p248
aVmakes us ugly and it corrupts us,
p249
aVand it threatens the very fabric of our society.
p250
aVWe owe it to one another and our country
p251
aVto reach out and try to connect.
p252
aVWe can't afford to hate them any longer,
p253
aVand we can't afford to let them hate us either.
p254
aVEmpathy and respect.
p255
aVEmpathy and respect.
p256
aVIf you think about it, it's the very least that we owe our fellow citizens.
p257
aa(lp258
VThank you.
