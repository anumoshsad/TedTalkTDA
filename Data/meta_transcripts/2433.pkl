VThere are a few things that all of us need.
p4
aVWe all need air to breathe.
p5
aVWe need clean water to drink.
p6
aVWe need food to eat. We need shelter and love.
p7
aVYou know. Love is great, too.
p8
aVAnd we all need a safe place to pee.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter) Yeah?
p11
aa(lp12
VAs a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary,
p13
aVif I could change the world tomorrow
p14
aVto make it easier for me to navigate,
p15
aVthe very first thing I would do
p16
aVis blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms
p17
aVin all public places.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aVTrans people and trans issues,
p21
aVthey've been getting a lot of mainstream media attention lately.
p22
aVAnd this is a great and necessary thing,
p23
aVbut most of that attention has been focused
p24
aVon a very few individuals,
p25
aVmost of whom are kinda rich
p26
aVand pretty famous,
p27
aVand probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee
p28
aVin between classes at their community college,
p29
aVor where they're going to get changed into their gym strip
p30
aVat their public high school.
p31
aVFame and money insulates these television star trans people
p32
aVfrom most of the everyday challenges
p33
aVthat the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis.
p34
aa(lp35
VPublic bathrooms.
p36
aVThey've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember,
p37
aVfirst when I was just a little baby tomboy
p38
aVand then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms
p43
aVare where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed.
p44
aVI've often been verbally attacked behind their doors.
p45
aVI've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up.
p46
aVI've been stared at, screamed at, whispered about,
p47
aVand one time I got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse
p48
aVthat from the looks of the shiner I took home that day
p49
aVI am pretty certain contained at least 70 dollars of rolled up small change
p50
aVand a large hard candy collection.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd I know what some of you are thinking,
p55
aVand you're mostly right.
p56
aVI can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days.
p57
aVBut that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it?
p58
aVAnd I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man.
p59
aVI'm a trans person.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd now we've got these fearmongering politicians
p62
aVthat keep trying to pass these bathroom bills.
p63
aVHave you heard about these?
p64
aVThey try to legislate to try and force people like myself
p65
aVto use the bathroom that they deem most appropriate
p66
aVaccording to the gender I was assigned at birth.
p67
aVAnd if these politicians ever get their way,
p68
aVin Arizona or California or Florida
p69
aVor just last week in Houston, Texas,
p70
aVor Ottawa,
p71
aVwell then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table,
p74
aVI can't help but wonder, you know,
p75
aVjust who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these. Right?
p76
aVPanty checks?
p77
aVReally.
p78
aVGenital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools?
p79
aVThere's no legal or ethical or plausible way
p80
aVto enforce laws like these anyway.
p81
aVThey exist only to foster fear
p82
aVand promote transphobia.
p83
aVThey don't make anyone safer.
p84
aVBut they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
p87
aVThey drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether.
p88
aVTrans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth
p89
aVface additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms,
p90
aVbut also universities,
p91
aVhospitals, libraries.
p92
aVDon't even get me started on how they treat us in airports.
p93
aa(lp94
VIf we don't move now
p95
aVto make sure that these places
p96
aVare truly open and accessible to everyone,
p97
aVthen we just need to get honest
p98
aVand quit calling them public places.
p99
aVWe need to just admit
p100
aVthat they are really only open for people
p101
aVwho fit neatly into one of two gender boxes,
p102
aVwhich I do not.
p103
aVI never have.
p104
aVAnd this starts very early.
p105
aa(lp106
VI know a little girl. She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
p107
aVShe's a self-identified tomboy.
p108
aVI'm talking about cowboy boots
p109
aVand Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
p110
aVOne time I asked her what her favorite color was.
p111
aVShe told me, "Camouflage."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo that awesome little kid,
p116
aVshe came home from school last October
p117
aVfrom her half day of preschool
p118
aVwith soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her
p119
aVwhen she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
p120
aVAnd the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
p121
aVAnd she had drank two glasses of that red juice
p122
aVat the Halloween party,
p123
aVand I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.
p124
aVAnd she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
p125
aa(lp126
VHer and her classmates were four years old.
p127
aVThey already felt empowered enough
p128
aVto police her use of the so-called public bathrooms.
p129
aVShe was four years old.
p130
aVShe had already been taught the brutal lesson
p131
aVthat there was no bathroom door at preschool
p132
aVwith a sign on it that welcomed people like her.
p133
aVShe'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem,
p134
aVand that problem started with her
p135
aVand was hers alone.
p136
aVSo my friend asked me to talk to her little daughter,
p137
aVand I did.
p138
aVI wanted to tell her
p139
aVthat me and her mom were going to march on down
p140
aVand talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away,
p141
aVbut I knew that wasn't true.
p142
aVI wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older,
p143
aVbut I couldn't.
p144
aVSo I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened,
p145
aVasked her to tell me how it made her feel.
p146
aV"Mad and sad,"
p147
aVshe told me.
p148
aVSo I told her
p149
aVthat she wasn't alone
p150
aVand that it wasn't right what had happened to her,
p151
aVand then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before.
p152
aVI said yes, I had,
p153
aVbut not for a really long time.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VWhich of course was a lie,
p158
aVbecause you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43,
p159
aVand sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit
p160
aVwhen you cough or sneeze,
p161
aVwhen you're running upstairs, or you're stretching.
p162
aVDon't lie.
p163
aVIt happens. Right?
p164
aVShe doesn't need to know that, I figure.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VI told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
p169
aVWhen you get old like me,
p170
aVyou're going to be able to hold your pee for way longer,
p171
aVI promised her.
p172
aa(lp173
V"Until you can get home?"
p174
aVshe asked me.
p175
aa(lp176
VI said, "Yes,
p177
aVuntil you can get home."
p178
aVShe seemed to take some comfort in that.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms
p181
aVwith a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes.
p182
aVWe can't change the world overnight
p183
aVfor our children,
p184
aVbut we can give them a safe and private place
p185
aVto escape that world,
p186
aVif only for just a minute.
p187
aVThis we can do.
p188
aVSo let's just do it.
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd if you are one of those people who is sitting out there right now
p191
aValready coming up with a list of reasons in your head why this is not a priority,
p192
aVor it's too expensive,
p193
aVor telling yourself that giving a trans person a safe place to pee
p194
aVor get changed in
p195
aVsupports a lifestyle choice that you feel offends your morality,
p196
aVor your masculinity,
p197
aVor your religious beliefs,
p198
aVthen let me just appeal
p199
aVto the part of your heart that probably, hopefully,
p200
aVdoes care about the rest of the population.
p201
aVIf you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me,
p202
aVthen what about women and girls
p203
aVwith body image issues?
p204
aVWhat about anyone with body image stuff going on?
p205
aVWhat about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates,
p206
aVwhose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?
p207
aVOh, grade eight,
p208
aVwhat a cruel master you can be.
p209
aVRight?
p210
aVWhat about people with anxiety issues?
p211
aVWhat about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there?
p212
aVWhat about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason,
p213
aVdon't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like?
p214
aVHow many of us still feel shy
p215
aVor afraid to disrobe in front of our peers,
p216
aVand how many of us allow that fear
p217
aVto keep us from something as important
p218
aVas physical exercise?
p219
aVWould all those people not benefit
p220
aVfrom these single stall facilities?
p221
aa(lp222
VWe can't change transphobic minds overnight,
p223
aVbut we can give everybody
p224
aVa place to get changed in
p225
aVso that we can all get to work
p226
aVmaking the world safer
p227
aVfor all of us.
p228
aa(lp229
