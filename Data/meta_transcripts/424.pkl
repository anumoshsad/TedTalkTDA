VThere are more Chinese restaurants in this country
p4
aVthan McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined \u2014
p5
aV40,000, actually.
p6
aVChinese restaurants have played an important role in American history,
p7
aVas a matter of fact.
p8
aVThe Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant
p9
aVcalled Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,
p10
aVwhich unfortunately is closed now,
p11
aVand about to be turned into Walgreen's.
p12
aVAnd the house where John Wilkes Booth
p13
aVplanned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln
p14
aVis also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok and Roll,
p15
aVon H Street in Washington.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd it's not completely gratuitous,
p20
aVbecause "wok" and "roll" \u2014 Chinese food and Japanese foods,
p21
aVso it kind of works out.
p22
aVAnd Americans love their Chinese food so much,
p23
aVthey've actually brought it into space.
p24
aVNASA, for example, serves thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork
p25
aVon its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, let me present the question to you:
p28
aVIf our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie,
p29
aVyou should ask yourself: how often do you eat apple pie,
p30
aVversus how often do you eat Chinese food?
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd if you think about it,
p35
aVa lot of the foods that we or Americans think of as Chinese food
p36
aVare barely recognizable to Chinese.
p37
aVFor example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,
p38
aVfortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.
p39
aVFor example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China,
p40
aVgave them to Chinese to see how they would react.
p41
aa(lp42
V[What is this?]
p43
aa(lp44
V[Should I try it?]
p45
aa(lp46
V[Try it!]
p47
aa(lp48
V[What is this called?]
p49
aa(lp50
V[Fortune cookie.]
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
V[There's a piece of paper inside!]
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
V[What is this?]
p59
aa(lp60
V[You've won a prize!]
p61
aa(lp62
V[What is this?]
p63
aa(lp64
V[It's a fortune!]
p65
aa(lp66
V[Tasty!]
p67
aa(lp68
VSo where are they from?
p69
aVThe short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.
p70
aVAnd in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries
p71
aVthat make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago,
p72
aV30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.
p73
aVIf you see them side by side,
p74
aVthere's yellow and brown.
p75
aVTheirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste,
p76
aVso they're not as sweet as our version.
p77
aVSo how did they get to the US?
p78
aVWell, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over,
p79
aVand a bunch of the bakers introduced them \u2014
p80
aVincluding at least one in Los Angeles,
p81
aVand one here in San Francisco, called Benkyodo,
p82
aVwhich is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.
p83
aVBack then, they made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons
p84
aVthat we saw back in Kyoto.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe interesting question is:
p87
aVHow do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese
p88
aVto being something that is Chinese?
p89
aVWell, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II,
p90
aVincluding those that made fortune cookies.
p91
aVSo that's when the Chinese moved in,
p92
aVsaw a market opportunity and took over.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese,
p97
aVpopularized by the Chinese,
p98
aVbut ultimately consumed by Americans.
p99
aVThey're more American than anything else.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnother of my favorite dishes:
p102
aVGeneral Tso's Chicken \u2014 which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy
p103
aVis called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VI love this dish.
p108
aVThe original name of my book was "The Long March of General Tso."
p109
aVAnd he has marched very far indeed,
p110
aVbecause he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken \u2014
p111
aVall things that Americans love.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VHe has marched so far, actually,
p116
aVthat the chef who originally invented the dish
p117
aVdoesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
p118
aa(lp119
VVideo: (In Chinese)
p120
aa(lp121
VAudience: (Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VHe's in Taiwan right now.
p124
aVHe's retired, deaf and plays a lot of mah\u2013jongg.
p125
aVAfter I showed him this, he got up,
p126
aVand says, "mòmíngqímiào," which means, "This is all nonsense,"
p127
aVand goes back to play his mah-jongg game during the afternoon.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnother dish, one of my favorites: beef with broccoli.
p130
aVBroccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;
p131
aVin fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
p132
aVIt was introduced into the United States in the 1800s,
p133
aVbut became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
p134
aVThe Chinese have their own version of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,
p135
aVbut they've now discovered American broccoli,
p136
aVand are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy.
p137
aa(lp138
VI guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.
p139
aVThat was a picture of General Tso.
p140
aVI went to his home town.
p141
aVThis is a billboard that says:
p142
aV"Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
p143
aVAnd I went looking for chicken.
p144
aVFinally found a cow \u2014
p145
aVand did find chicken.
p146
aVBelieve it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives
p151
aVwho are still in the town.
p152
aVThis guy is now five generations removed from the General;
p153
aVthis guy is about seven.
p154
aVI showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken,
p155
aVand they were like,
p156
aV"We don't know this dish. Is this Chinese food?"
p157
aVBecause it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
p158
aVBut they weren't surprised I traveled around the world to visit them,
p159
aVbecause in their eyes he is, after all,
p160
aVa famous Qing dynasty military hero.
p161
aVHe played an important role in the Taiping Rebellion,
p162
aVa war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God
p163
aVand baby brother of Jesus Christ.
p164
aVHe caused a war that killed 20 million people \u2014
p165
aVstill the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.
p166
aVSo, you know, I realized when I was there,
p167
aVGeneral Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America,
p168
aVin that he's known for chicken and not war.
p169
aVBut in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes
p172
aVwe probably ought to talk about is chop suey,
p173
aVwhich was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.
p174
aVAccording to the New York Times in 1904,
p175
aVthere was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town,
p176
aVand "... the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."
p177
aVSo it took about 30 years before the Americans realized
p178
aVthat chop suey is actually not known in China,
p179
aVand as this article points out,
p180
aV"The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."
p181
aVBack then it was a way to show you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;
p182
aVa guy who wanted to impress a girl could take her on a chop suey date.
p183
aVI like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke
p184
aVone culture ever played on another,
p185
aVbecause "chop suey," translated into Chinese,
p186
aVmeans "jaahp-seui," which, translated back, means "odds and ends."
p187
aVSo, these people are going around China asking for chop suey,
p188
aVwhich is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying,
p189
aV"I understand you have a very popular dish in your country
p190
aVcalled 'leftovers.'"
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VRight?
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd not only that:
p199
aV"This dish is particularly popular
p200
aVafter that holiday you call 'Thanksgiving.'"
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo, why and where did chop suey come from?
p205
aVLet's go back to the mid-1800s,
p206
aVwhen the Chinese first came to America.
p207
aVBack then, Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.
p208
aVIn fact, they saw these people who landed at their shores as alien.
p209
aVThese people weren't eating dogs, they were eating cats.
p210
aVIf they weren't eating cats, they were eating rats.
p211
aVIn fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer,
p212
aVin 1883 ran an article that asked,
p213
aV"Do Chinese eat rats?"
p214
aVNot the most PC question to be asked today,
p215
aVbut if you look at the popular imagery of the time,
p216
aVnot so outlandish.
p217
aVThis is actually a real advertisement for rat poison
p218
aVfrom the late 1800s.
p219
aVAnd if you see under the word "Clears" \u2014 very small \u2014
p220
aVit says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats,
p221
aVbut to the Chinese in their midst,
p222
aVbecause the way that the food was perceived
p223
aVwas that these people who ate foods different from us
p224
aVmust be different from us.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnother way that you saw this antipathy towards the Chinese
p227
aVis through documents like this.
p228
aVThis is in the Library of Congress.
p229
aVIt's a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers,
p230
aVhero of our American labor movement.
p231
aVIt's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion:
p232
aVMeat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism:
p233
aVWhich shall survive?"
p234
aVAnd it basically made the argument
p235
aVthat Chinese men who ate rice
p236
aVwould necessarily bring down the standard of living
p237
aVfor American men who ate meat.
p238
aVAnd as a matter of fact, then,
p239
aVthis is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country.
p240
aVSo, with sentiments like these,
p241
aVthe Chinese Exclusion Act was passed between 1882 and 1902,
p242
aVthe only time in American history
p243
aVwhen a group was specifically excluded
p244
aVfor its national origin or ethnicity.
p245
aVSo in a way, because the Chinese were attacked,
p246
aVchop suey was created as a defense mechanism.
p247
aa(lp248
VWho came up with the idea of chop suey?
p249
aVThere's a lot of different mysteries and legends,
p250
aVbut of the ones I've found,
p251
aVthe most interesting is this article from 1904.
p252
aVA Chinese guy named Lem Sen
p253
aVshows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says,
p254
aV"I want you all to stop making chop suey,
p255
aVbecause I am the original creator and sole proprietor of chop suey.
p256
aVAnd the way he tells it,
p257
aVthere was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up,
p258
aVand he was told to make a dish that looked very popular
p259
aVand could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.
p260
aVAnd as he said \u2014 we would never print this today \u2014
p261
aVbut basically, the American man has become very rich.
p262
aVLem Sen: "I would've made this money, too, but I spent all this time
p263
aVlooking for the American man who stole my recipe.
p264
aVNow I've found him and I want my recipe back,
p265
aVand I want everyone to stop making chop suey,
p266
aVor pay me for the right to do the same.
p267
aVSo it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe thing is, this idea of Chinese-American food
p270
aVdoesn't exist only in America.
p271
aVIn fact, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet,
p272
aVserved on all seven continents, even Antarctica,
p273
aVbecause Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station,
p274
aVwhich is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
p275
aVYou see different varieties of Chinese food.
p276
aVFor example, there is French Chinese food,
p277
aVwhere they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
p278
aVThere is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies,
p279
aVso they serve fried gelato.
p280
aVMy neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her,
p281
aV"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
p282
aVShe's like, "It's not? But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VEven the Brits have their own version.
p287
aVThis is a dish called "crispy shredded beef,"
p288
aVwhich has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.
p289
aVThere is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food,
p290
aVMiddle Eastern Chinese food, Mauritian Chinese food.
p291
aVThis is a dish called "Magic Bowl," that I discovered.
p292
aVThere's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food,
p293
aVJapanese Chinese food,
p294
aVwhere they take the bao, the little buns, and make them into pizza versions.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dishes,
p299
aVand just ramenize them.
p300
aVThis is something that, in the Chinese version, has no soup.
p301
aVSo, there's Peruvian Chinese food,
p302
aVwhich should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food,
p303
aVwhere they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd they have things like risotto chop suey.
p308
aVMy personal favorite of all the restaurants
p309
aVI've encountered around the world
p310
aVwas this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VSo, let's take a step back and understand
p315
aVwhat is to be appreciated in America.
p316
aVMcDonald's has garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect,
p317
aVfor basically standardizing the menu, decor and dining experience
p318
aVin post-World War II America.
p319
aVBut you know what?
p320
aVThey did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois.
p321
aVChinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue,
p322
aVwith the menu and the decor, even the restaurant name,
p323
aVbut without a centralized headquarters.
p324
aVSo, this actually became very clear to me
p325
aVwith the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,
p326
aVwhere they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had,
p327
aVto have three or four second-place winners,
p328
aVpeople who match five or six Powerball numbers.
p329
aVInstead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.
p330
aa(lp331
VThey looked all across the country and discovered it couldn't be fraud,
p332
aVsince it happened in different states, across different computer systems.
p333
aVWhatever it was, it caused people to behave in a mass-synchronized way.
p334
aVSo, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the pieces of paper,
p335
aVlike it was a diamond, or diagonal.
p336
aVIt wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television.
p337
aVSo they looked at an episode of "Lost."
p338
aVNow, I don't have a TV,
p339
aVwhich makes me a freak, but very productive \u2014
p340
aa(lp341
V(Laughter)
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd there's an episode of "Lost" where one guy has a lucky number,
p344
aVbut it's not a lucky number, it's why he's on the island,
p345
aVbut they looked and the numbers did not match.
p346
aVThey looked at "The Young and The Restless." It wasn't that, either.
p347
aVIt wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him,
p348
aV"Where did you get your number?"
p349
aVHe said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."
p350
aVThis is a slip one of the winners had,
p351
aVbecause the Tennessee lottery security officials
p352
aVwere like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."
p353
aVBut it was true.
p354
aVBasically, of those 110 people,
p355
aV104 of them or so had gotten their number from a fortune cookie.
p356
aa(lp357
V(Laughter)
p358
aa(lp359
VYeah. So I went and started looking.
p360
aVI went across the country, looking for these restaurants
p361
aVwhere these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.
p362
aVThere are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha \u2014
p363
aVwhich is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point,
p364
aVand a bunch of them named "China Buffet."
p365
aVWhat's interesting is that their stories were similar, but different.
p366
aVIt was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet,
p367
aVit was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
p368
aVBut at some point, all these people had a very similar experience
p369
aVthat converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant.
p370
aVAnd all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies,
p371
aVwhich, of course, aren't even Chinese to begin with.
p372
aVIt's part of the phenomenon I called "spontaneous self-organization,"
p373
aVwhere, like in ant colonies, little decisions made on the micro level
p374
aVactually have a big impact on the macro level.
p375
aa(lp376
VA good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
p377
aVMcDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
p378
aVThey did chicken pot pie, fried chicken, and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
p379
aVAnd the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggifying them,
p380
aVthat's kind of an easy concept.
p381
aVThe trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone
p382
aVin a cost-efficient manner,
p383
aVwhich is why it took so long for people to copy them \u2014 10 years,
p384
aVthen within a couple months, it was such a hit,
p385
aVthey introduced it across the entire McDonald's system in the country.
p386
aa(lp387
VIn contrast is General Tso's Chicken,
p388
aVwhich actually started in New York City in the early 1970s,
p389
aVas I was also started in this universe in New York City in the early 1970s.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd this logo!
p394
aVSo me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmicly related.
p395
aVBut that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America
p396
aVfrom a restaurant in New York City.
p397
aVSomeone's like, "It's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken \u2014
p398
aVAmericans will love this."
p399
aa(lp400
VSo what I like to say, this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,
p401
aVis that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of dining experiences.
p402
aVWe can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux,
p403
aVsort of an open-source thing, right?
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VWhere ideas from one person can be copied and propagated
p408
aVacross the entire system,
p409
aVthat there can be specialized versions of Chinese food,
p410
aVdepending on the region.
p411
aVFor example, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food,
p412
aVwhere they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish.
p413
aVAnd in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,
p414
aVwhich is like an egg roll on the outside and cheesesteak on the inside.
p415
aVI was surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.
p416
aVWhat had happened was,
p417
aVa Chinese family had moved from Philadelphia to Atlanta,
p418
aVand brought that with them.
p419
aa(lp420
VSo the thing is,
p421
aVour historical lore, because of the way we like narratives,
p422
aVis full of vast characters, such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks
p423
aVand Ray Kroc with McDonald's
p424
aVand Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.
p425
aVBut, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters.
p426
aVFor example, Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey,
p427
aVChef Peng, who introduced General Tso's Chicken,
p428
aVand all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.
p429
aVSo, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice;
p430
aVthat those whose names are forgotten in history
p431
aVcan often have had as much, if not more,
p432
aVimpact on what we eat today.
p433
aa(lp434
VThank you very much.
