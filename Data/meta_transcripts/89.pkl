VThis is me. My name is Ben Saunders.
p4
aVI specialize in dragging heavy things
p5
aVaround cold places.
p6
aa(lp7
VOn May 11th last year,
p8
aVI stood alone at the North geographic Pole.
p9
aVI was the only human being in an area
p10
aVone-and-a-half times the size of America,
p11
aVfive-and-a-half thousand square miles.
p12
aVMore than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.
p13
aV12 people have stood on the moon.
p14
aVIncluding me, only four people
p15
aVhave skied solo to the North Pole.
p16
aVAnd I think the reason for that \u2014
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aV\u2014 thank you \u2014 I think the reason for that is that it's \u2014 it's \u2014
p19
aVwell, it's as Chris said, bonkers.
p20
aVIt's a journey that is right at the limit
p21
aVof human capability.
p22
aVI skied the equivalent of 31 marathons
p23
aVback to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.
p24
aVAnd I was dragging all the food I needed,
p25
aVthe supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,
p26
aVone change of underwear \u2014 everything I needed for nearly three months.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVWhat we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,
p29
aVis to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?
p30
aVThe second one is,
p31
aVhow do you go to the loo at minus 40?
p32
aV"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,
p33
aVexposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"
p34
aVI don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.
p35
aVThird one: how do you top that? What's next?
p36
aa(lp37
VIt all started back in 2001.
p38
aVMy first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow \u2014 enormously experienced chap.
p39
aVThis was like my polar apprenticeship.
p40
aVWe were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,
p41
aVSevernaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.
p42
aVAnd the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,
p43
aVgeographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.
p44
aVThis is about as good as maps get,
p45
aVand to reach it you've got to ski literally
p46
aVover the frozen crust,
p47
aVthe floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.
p48
aVI'd spoken to all the experts.
p49
aVI'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.
p50
aVBut I realized on the morning of day one
p51
aVthat I had no idea exactly
p52
aVwhat I'd let myself in for.
p53
aa(lp54
VI was 23 years old. No one my age
p55
aVhad attempted anything like this,
p56
aVand pretty quickly, almost everything
p57
aVthat could have gone wrong did go wrong.
p58
aVWe were attacked by a polar bear on day two.
p59
aVI had frostbite in my left big toe.
p60
aVWe started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.
p61
aVSome very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.
p62
aVWe had
p63
aVdecidedly low-tech communications.
p64
aVWe couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.
p65
aVYou can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.
p66
aVThere's a wire dangling down either side.
p67
aVThat was our HF radio antenna.
p68
aVWe had less than two hours
p69
aVtwo-way communication with the outside world in two months.
p70
aVUltimately, we ran out of time.
p71
aVWe'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left
p72
aVto go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.
p73
aVWe were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;
p74
aVwe spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,
p75
aVand they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.
p76
aVWe've got to pick you up."
p77
aVAnd I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.
p78
aVI was a failure.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe one goal, the one dream I'd had
p81
aVfor as long as I could remember \u2014 I hadn't even come close.
p82
aVAnd skiing along that first trip, I had two
p83
aVimaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind
p84
aVwhen the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.
p85
aVThe first one was reaching the Pole itself.
p86
aVI could see vividly, I suppose,
p87
aVbeing filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,
p88
aVand I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.
p89
aVI could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know \u2014
p90
aVah, glorious moment \u2014 the music kind of reaching a crescendo.
p91
aVThe second video clip
p92
aVthat I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,
p93
aVand I could see again, vividly,
p94
aVthe camera flashbulbs going off,
p95
aVthe paparazzi, the autograph hunters,
p96
aVthe book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.
p97
aVAnd of course, neither of these things happened.
p98
aVWe didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money
p99
aVto pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard
p100
aVof this expedition.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;
p103
aVmy granddad was there \u2014 had a little Union Jack \u2014
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV\u2014 and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.
p106
aVI was physically exhausted,
p107
aVmentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.
p108
aVIn a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,
p109
aVand lying on my mum's sofa,
p110
aVday in day out, watching daytime TV.
p111
aVMy brother sent me a text message, an SMS \u2014
p112
aVit was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said,
p113
aV"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.
p114
aVThe lesson is: don't even try."
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VFast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,
p118
aVand start planning another expedition. This time,
p119
aVI wanted to go right across, on my own this time,
p120
aVfrom Russia, at the top of the map,
p121
aVto the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,
p122
aVand then on to Canada.
p123
aVNo one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
p124
aVTwo Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.
p125
aVVery famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,
p126
aVReinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,
p127
aVand he was rescued after a week.
p128
aVHe described this expedition as 10 times
p129
aVas dangerous as Everest.
p130
aVSo for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,
p131
aVbut I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,
p132
aVlet alone make it across to Canada,
p133
aVI had to take a radical approach.
p134
aVThis meant everything from perfecting the
p135
aVsawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,
p136
aVto working with one of the world's leading nutritionists
p137
aVin developing a completely new,
p138
aVrevolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:
p139
aV6,000 calories a day.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd the expedition started in February last year.
p142
aVBig support team. We had a film crew,
p143
aVa couple of logistics people with us,
p144
aVmy girlfriend, a photographer.
p145
aVAt first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.
p146
aVThe next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,
p147
aVon a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,
p148
aVspelled K-R-A-S.
p149
aVThe next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane
p150
aVto fly us up to a town called Khatanga,
p151
aVwhich was the sort of last bit of civilization.
p152
aVOur cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,
p153
aVactually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,
p154
aVand the pilot \u2014 Russian pilot \u2014 completely deadpan, replied,
p155
aV"Six hours \u2014 if we live."
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVWe got to Khatanga.
p158
aVI think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,
p159
aVbut you can see it from there.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVIt was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.
p162
aVThere was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between
p163
aVthe helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,
p164
aVso we were stuck. We couldn't move.
p165
aVFinally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,
p166
aVloaded up the helicopters \u2014 two helicopters flying in tandem \u2014
p167
aVdropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.
p168
aVWe had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,
p169
aVphotography; while the helicopter was still there,
p170
aVI did an interview on the satellite phone;
p171
aVand then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,
p172
aVwham, the door closed, and I was alone.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.
p175
aVAll I could think about was running back up to the door,
p176
aVbanging on the door, and saying, "Look guys,
p177
aVI haven't quite thought this through."
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aVTo make things worse, you can just see the white dot
p180
aVup at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.
p181
aa(lp182
VBecause we'd been held up in Russia, of course,
p183
aVthe full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;
p184
aVwhen you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,
p185
aVhigh and low tides generally mean
p186
aVthat interesting things are going to happen \u2014 the ice is going to start moving around a bit.
p187
aVI was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.
p188
aVGrand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,
p189
aV180 kilos \u2014 that's almost exactly 400 pounds.
p190
aVWhen the ice was flat or flattish,
p191
aVI could just about pull both.
p192
aVWhen the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.
p193
aVI had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.
p194
aVLiterally scrambling through what's called pressure ice \u2014
p195
aVthe ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,
p196
aVthe wind and the tides.
p197
aVNASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
p198
aVAnd it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.
p199
aVI was skiing into headwinds for nine
p200
aVout of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,
p201
aVand I was drifting backwards most of the time.
p202
aVMy record was minus 2.5 miles.
p203
aVI got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,
p204
aVput the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back
p205
aVthan when I'd started.
p206
aVI literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Video): So it's day 22.
p209
aVI'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.
p210
aVThe weather is just appalling \u2014
p211
aVoh, drifted back about five miles
p212
aVin the last \u2014 last night.
p213
aVLater in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.
p214
aVIt was a lack of ice \u2014 open water.
p215
aVI knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.
p216
aVI knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.
p217
aVThis was my little bit of bio-mimicry.
p218
aVPolar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.
p219
aVIf they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.
p220
aVSo we had a dry suit developed \u2014 I worked with a team in Norway \u2014
p221
aVbased on a sort of survival suit \u2014
p222
aVI suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear \u2014
p223
aVthat I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,
p224
aVit would pull up around my face,  and seal pretty tightly around my face.
p225
aVAnd this meant I could ski
p226
aVover very thin ice,
p227
aVand if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.
p228
aVIt also meant, if the worst came to the worst,
p229
aVI could actually jump in and swim across
p230
aVand drag the sledge over after me.
p231
aVSome pretty radical technology,
p232
aVa radical approach \u2014but it worked perfectly.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnother exciting thing we did last year
p235
aVwas with communications technology.
p236
aVIn 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition \u2014
p237
aVthere was \u2014 one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.
p238
aVHe said, "The explorers of 2012,
p239
aVif there is anything left to explore,
p240
aVwill no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones
p241
aVfitted with wireless telescopes."
p242
aVWell, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,
p243
aVIridium satellite phone.
p244
aVThe wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
p245
aVAnd every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,
p246
aVI was blogging live from my tent,
p247
aVsending back a little diary piece,
p248
aVsending back information on the distance I'd covered \u2014
p249
aVthe ice conditions, the temperature \u2014
p250
aVand a daily photo.
p251
aVRemember, 2001,
p252
aVwe had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.
p253
aVLast year, blogging live from an expedition
p254
aVthat's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.
p255
aVIt wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating
p256
aVin what's called a whiteout.
p257
aVWhen you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.
p258
aVYou can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow
p259
aVribbon tied to one of my ski poles.
p260
aVI'd navigate using the direction of the wind.
p261
aVSo, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.
p262
aa(lp263
VI got to the Pole on the 11th of May.
p264
aVIt took me 68 days to get there from Russia,
p265
aVand there is nothing there.
p266
aV(Laughter).
p267
aVThere isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,
p268
aVpurely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.
p269
aVStick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.
p270
aVI knew this, but I was expecting something.
p271
aVStrange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,
p272
aVa lot of open water around, and
p273
aVof course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,
p274
aVbut starting to really realize
p275
aVthat my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,
p276
aVwhich was still 400 miles away,
p277
aVwere slim at best.
p278
aVThe only proof I've got that I was there
p279
aVis a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.
p280
aVYou can just see \u2014
p281
aVthere's a nine and a string of zeros here.
p282
aVNinety degrees north \u2014 that is slap bang in the North Pole.
p283
aVI took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.
p284
aVTook a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.
p285
aVI warmed the battery up in my armpit.
p286
aVI dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.
p287
aVI dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.
p288
aVAnd I got three voicemails.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aV(Video): Ninety.
p291
aVIt's a special feeling.
p292
aVThe entire planet
p293
aVis rotating
p294
aVbeneath my feet.
p295
aVThe \u2014 the whole world underneath me.
p296
aVI finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.
p297
aVShe started crying. She asked me to call her back.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VI skied on for a week past the Pole.
p301
aVI wanted to get as close to Canada as I could
p302
aVbefore conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
p303
aVThis was the last day I had on the ice.
p304
aVWhen I spoke to the \u2014 my project management team,
p305
aVthey said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.
p306
aVThere are huge areas of open water just south of your position.
p307
aVWe'd like to pick you up.
p308
aVBen, could you please look for an airstrip?"
p309
aVThis was the view outside my tent
p310
aVwhen I had this fateful phone call.
p311
aVI'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,
p312
aV"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of
p313
aVflat, thick safe ice."
p314
aVThe only bit of ice I could find \u2014
p315
aVit took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip \u2014
p316
aVwas exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.
p317
aVI didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.
p318
aVI thought, it'll have to do.
p319
aV(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
p320
aa(lp321
VIt just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing \u2014
p322
aVthe plane actually passed over four times,
p323
aVand I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.
p324
aVThe pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy
p325
aVthat did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.
p326
aVI was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed \u2014 a pretty emotional moment.
p327
aVSo I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.
p328
aVI'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.
p329
aVThe plane taxied up to where I was standing.
p330
aVThe door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."
p331
aV(Laughter).
p332
aVThe co-pilot was a lady called Monica.
p333
aVShe sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.
p334
aVThey were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.
p335
aVTroy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;
p336
aVwe took a few photos. He
p337
aVclimbed up the ladder. He said, "Just \u2014 just get in the back."
p338
aVHe threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,
p339
aVand I climbed in the back.
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aVTaxied up and down the runway a few times,
p342
aVjust to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to \u2014
p343
aVI'm going to give it a go." And he \u2014
p344
aVI've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.
p345
aVHe put his hand on the throttle.
p346
aVYou can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.
p347
aVIt's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.
p348
aVMonica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.
p349
aVI thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're \u2014 this is all or nothing."
p350
aVRammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.
p351
aVOne of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,
p352
aVbanking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,
p353
aVand he just took one hand off, reached back,
p354
aVflipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,
p355
aVand it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVAnd only from the air did I see the big picture.
p358
aVOf course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,
p359
aVwhether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
p360
aVThis is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.
p361
aVI mean, it really was starting to break up.
p362
aa(lp363
VWhy? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.
p364
aVI'm not skiing along drawing maps;
p365
aVeveryone knows where the North Pole is.
p366
aVAt the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.
p367
aVThere's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.
p368
aVFor me, this is about exploring human limits,
p369
aVabout exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology
p370
aVand of technology. They're the things that excite me.
p371
aVAnd it's also about potential, on a personal level.
p372
aVThis, for me, is a chance to explore the limits \u2014
p373
aVreally push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.
p374
aVAnd on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life
p375
aVjust scratching the surface of their potential,
p376
aVjust doing three or four or five percent
p377
aVof what they're truly capable of. So,
p378
aVon a wider scale, I hope that this journey
p379
aVwas a chance to inspire other people
p380
aVto think about what they want to do
p381
aVwith their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time
p382
aVwe each have on this planet.
p383
aVThat's as close as I can come to summing that up.
p384
aa(lp385
VThe next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?
p386
aVThe answer, of course, to which is a trade secret \u2014
p387
aVand the last question,
p388
aVwhat's next? As quickly as possible,
p389
aVif I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.
p390
aVWhat's next:
p391
aVAntarctica.
p392
aVIt's the coldest, highest,
p393
