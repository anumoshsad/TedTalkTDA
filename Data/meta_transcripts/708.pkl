VThe National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
p4
aVto presenting great American lives,
p5
aVamazing people.
p6
aVAnd that's what it's about.
p7
aVWe use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.
p8
aVAnd so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
p9
aVI'm going to talk about a program I started there,
p10
aVwhich, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
p11
aa(lp12
VI started to worry about the fact
p13
aVthat a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,
p14
aVand they're amazing people,
p15
aVand we want to deliver them to future generations.
p16
aVSo, how do we do that?
p17
aVAnd so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
p18
aVAnd the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
p19
aVmy being a brush in the hand
p20
aVof amazing people who would come and I would interview.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you
p23
aVthe great hits of that program,
p24
aVas to give you this whole notion
p25
aVof how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
p26
aVwhat you try to find out about them,
p27
aVand when people deliver and when they don't and why.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, I had two preconditions.
p30
aVOne was that they be American.
p31
aVThat's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
p32
aVit's created to look at American lives.
p33
aVThat was easy, but then I made the decision,
p34
aVmaybe arbitrary,
p35
aVthat they needed to be people of a certain age,
p36
aVwhich at that point, when I created this program,
p37
aVseemed really old.
p38
aVSixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
p39
aVFor obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd why did I do that?
p42
aVWell, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.
p43
aVAnd I thought really what we need is an elders program
p44
aVto just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
p45
aVBut the second part of it \u2014 and the older I get,
p46
aVthe more convinced I am that that's true.
p47
aVIt's amazing what people will say when they know
p48
aVhow the story turned out.
p49
aVThat's the one advantage that older people have.
p50
aVWell, they have other, little bit of advantage,
p51
aVbut they also have some disadvantages,
p52
aVbut the one thing they or we have is that
p53
aVwe've reached the point in life
p54
aVwhere we know how the story turned out.
p55
aVSo, we can then go back in our lives,
p56
aVif we've got an interviewer who gets that,
p57
aVand begin to reflect on how we got there.
p58
aVAll of those accidents that wound up
p59
aVcreating the life narrative that we inherited.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, I thought okay, now,
p62
aVwhat is it going to take to make this work?
p63
aVThere are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
p64
aVThere are the journalist interviews,
p65
aVwhich are the interrogation that is expected.
p66
aVThis is somewhat against resistance
p67
aVand caginess on the part of the interviewee.
p68
aVThen there's the celebrity interview,
p69
aVwhere it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.
p70
aVThat's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
p71
aVThat's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
p72
aVas Nixon in that process.
p73
aVFair enough.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I wanted interviews that were different.
p76
aVI wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
p77
aVwhich is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
p78
aVand to be an agent of their self-revelation.
p79
aVBy the way, this was always done in public.
p80
aVThis was not an oral history program.
p81
aVThis was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
p82
aVand having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.
p85
aVI didn't know it coming into it.
p86
aVAnd the only reason I really know that
p87
aVis because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
p88
aVand that was six months after he'd had a stroke.
p89
aVAnd he had never appeared in public since that point.
p90
aVThis was not a devastating stroke,
p91
aVbut it did affect his speaking and so forth.
p92
aVAnd I thought it was worth a chance,
p93
aVhe thought it was worth a chance,
p94
aVand so we got up on the stage,
p95
aVand we had an hour conversation about his life,
p96
aVand after that a woman rushed up to me,
p97
aVessentially did,
p98
aVand she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.
p103
aVWhen he started a sentence, particularly
p104
aVin the early parts of the interview,
p105
aVand paused, you gave him the word,
p106
aVthe bridge to get to the end of the sentence,
p107
aVand by the end of it,
p108
aVhe was speaking complete sentences on his own."
p109
aVI didn't know what was going on,
p110
aVbut I was so part of the process of getting that out.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,
p113
aVor empathy, at any rate,
p114
aVis what's critical to this kind of interview.
p115
aVBut then I began to think of other things.
p116
aVWho makes a great interview in this context?
p117
aVIt had nothing to do with their intellect,
p118
aVthe quality of their intellect.
p119
aVSome of them were very brilliant,
p120
aVsome of them were,
p121
aVyou know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,
p122
aVbut it was never about that.
p123
aVIt was about their energy.
p124
aVIt's energy that creates extraordinary interviews
p125
aVand extraordinary lives.
p126
aVI'm convinced of it.
p127
aVAnd it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
p128
aVThese were people through their 90s.
p129
aa(lp130
VIn fact, the first person I interviewed
p131
aVwas George Abbott, who was 97,
p132
aVand Abbott was filled with the life force \u2014
p133
aVI guess that's the way I think about it \u2014 filled with it.
p134
aVAnd so he filled the room,
p135
aVand we had an extraordinary conversation.
p136
aVHe was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
p137
aVbecause he was famous for being silent,
p138
aVfor never ever saying anything
p139
aVexcept maybe a word or two.
p140
aVAnd, in fact, he did wind up opening up \u2014
p141
aVby the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
p142
aVHe subsequently got married again at 102,
p143
aVso he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut after the interview, I got a call,
p146
aVvery gruff voice, from a woman.
p147
aVI didn't know who she was,
p148
aVand she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,
p153
aVand I could never do it."
p154
aVAnd then she made me go up with the tape of it
p155
aVand prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo, you know, you want energy,
p158
aVyou want the life force,
p159
aVbut you really want them also to think
p160
aVthat they have a story worth sharing.
p161
aVThe worst interviews that you can ever have
p162
aVare with people who are modest.
p163
aVNever ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,
p164
aVbecause all of these people have been assembled
p165
aVto listen to them, and they sit there and they say,
p166
aV"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."
p167
aVThere's nothing that ever happens that justifies
p168
aVpeople taking good hours of the day to be with them.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.
p171
aVThe journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
p172
aVThis guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,
p173
aVand every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.
p174
aVDidn't matter." Whatever.
p175
aVAwful.
p176
aVI never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
p177
aVThey have to think that they did something
p178
aVand that they want to share it with you.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut it comes down, in the end,
p181
aVto how do you get through all the barriers we have.
p182
aVAll of us are public and private beings,
p183
aVand if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,
p184
aVthere's no point in it.
p185
aVIt's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,
p186
aVand we all have infomercials about our lives.
p187
aVWe know the great lines, we know the great moments,
p188
aVwe know what we're not going to share,
p189
aVand the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
p190
aVThis wasn't \u2014 and some of you will remember
p191
aVMike Wallace's old interviews \u2014
p192
aVtough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.
p193
aa(lp194
VI was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,
p195
aVto break out of their own cocoon of the public self,
p196
aVand the more public they had been,
p197
aVthe more entrenched that person, that outer person was.
p198
aVAnd let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment
p199
aVthat happened in this interview series.
p200
aVIt all has to do with that shell that most of us have,
p201
aVand particularly certain people.
p202
aa(lp203
VThere's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.
p204
aVIt'll be your generational determinant
p205
aVas to whether her name means much to you.
p206
aVShe did so much. She was a playwright.
p207
aVShe did an extraordinary play called "The Women."
p208
aVShe was a congresswoman
p209
aVwhen there weren't very many congresswomen.
p210
aVShe was editor of Vanity Fair,
p211
aVone of the great phenomenal women of her day.
p212
aVAnd, incidentally, I call her
p213
aVthe Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.
p214
aVShe was sort of adored on the Right
p215
aVthe way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
p216
aVAnd, in fact, when we did the interview \u2014
p217
aVI did the living self-portrait with her \u2014
p218
aVthere were three former directors of the CIA
p219
aVbasically sitting at her feet,
p220
aVjust enjoying her presence.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,
p223
aVbecause I always have preliminary talks with these people
p224
aVfor just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
p225
aVWe never talk before that because if you talk before,
p226
aVyou don't get it on the stage.
p227
aVSo she and I had a delightful conversation.
p228
aa(lp229
VWe were on the stage and then \u2014
p230
aVby the way, spectacular.
p231
aVIt was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.
p232
aVShe was in a great evening gown.
p233
aVShe was 80, almost that day of the interview,
p234
aVand there she was and there I was,
p235
aVand I just proceeded into the questions.
p236
aVAnd she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.
p237
aVAnything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,
p238
aVand I was basically up there \u2014 any of you
p239
aVin the moderate-to-full entertainment world
p240
aVknow what it is to die onstage.
p241
aVAnd I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd I began to wonder what was going on,
p244
aVand you think while you talk,
p245
aVand basically, I thought, I got it.
p246
aVWhen we were alone, I was her audience.
p247
aVNow I'm her competitor for the audience.
p248
aVThat's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,
p249
aVand so then I asked her a question \u2014
p250
aVI didn't know how I was going to get out of it \u2014
p251
aVI asked her a question about her days as a playwright,
p252
aVand again, characteristically,
p253
aVinstead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"
p254
aVshe said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.
p255
aVMost people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."
p256
aVBut I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,
p257
aVand she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.
p258
aVIt was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,
p259
aVand I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd then she turned to me and said,
p262
aV"And you know what those young actors did?
p263
aVThey upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"
p264
aVJust withering in her contempt.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd I said, "I'm learning."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,
p271
aVand then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account
p272
aVof what her life really was like.
p273
aa(lp274
VI have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.
p275
aVAgain, a remarkable person.
p276
aVI'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,
p277
aVI'm attracted to her.
p278
aVAnd the way she died \u2014 she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.
p279
aVThat's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,
p280
aVand very few of us were invited to a dinner party.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd she was in horrible pain.
p283
aVWe all knew that.
p284
aVShe stayed in her room.
p285
aVEverybody came. The butler passed around canapes.
p286
aVThe usual sort of thing.
p287
aVThen at a certain moment, the door opened
p288
aVand she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.
p289
aVThe public self, the beauty, the intellect,
p290
aVand she walked around and talked to every person there
p291
aVand then went back into the room and was never seen again.
p292
aVShe wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,
p295
aVand this is just a brief reference.
p296
aVIt wasn't this arm-wrestle,
p297
aVbut it was a little surprising for the person involved.
p298
aVI interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.
p299
aVAnd we were sitting there,
p300
aVand almost toward the beginning of the interview,
p301
aVI turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,
p302
aVit is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.
p303
aVWas yours unhappy?"
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd he looked at me, you know, as if to say,
p306
aV"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"
p307
aVAnd then he turned to me, not stupidly,
p308
aVand he said, "What was your childhood like?"
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd I said \u2014 these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate \u2014
p311
aVand I said, "My father was loving and supportive,
p312
aVwhich is why I'm not funny."
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.
p317
aVHis father was an SOB,
p318
aVand, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,
p319
aVbut then we were off and running.
p320
aVSo the question is:
p321
aVWhat is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?
p322
aa(lp323
VNow, these are arm wrestle questions,
p324
aVbut I want to tell you about questions
p325
aVthat are more related to empathy
p326
aVand that really, very often, are the questions
p327
aVthat people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.
p328
aVAnd I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
p329
aa(lp330
VOne was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.
p331
aVAgain, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.
p332
aVHe did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
p333
aVspent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,
p334
aVand by the way, at one point I asked him,
p335
aV"Would you like to have met him?"
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd he said, "Well, of course,
p338
aVbut actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,
p339
aVbecause I got to read all of his letters."
p340
aVSo, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd I asked him one question.
p343
aVI said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson
p346
aVand connecting with him,
p347
aVand he said, "Well ..." \u2014 I'm going to do a bad southern accent.
p348
aVDumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.
p349
aVBut he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."
p350
aVHe said, "You know, I've read everything,
p351
aVand sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd he basically was saying that this was a man
p354
aVwho lied more than he wished he had,
p355
aVbecause he saw the letters.
p356
aVHe said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."
p357
aVHe said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,
p358
aVso that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."
p361
aVAnd he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,
p362
aVand I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,
p363
aVand he and she had exactly the relationship
p364
aVof Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
p365
aVShe was the New Englander and abrasive,
p366
aVand he was this courtly fellow.
p367
aa(lp368
VBut really the most important question I ever asked,
p369
aVand most of the times when I talk about it,
p370
aVpeople kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,
p371
aVbut I promise you it was the right question.
p372
aVThis was to Agnes de Mille.
p373
aVAgnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
p374
aVShe basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"
p375
aVtransforming the American theater.
p376
aVAn amazing woman.
p377
aa(lp378
VAt the time that I proposed to her that \u2014
p379
aVby the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary \u2014
p380
aVbut proposed to her that she come on.
p381
aVShe said, "Come to my apartment."
p382
aVShe lived in New York.
p383
aV"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,
p384
aVand then we'll decide whether we proceed."
p385
aa(lp386
VAnd so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,
p387
aVand she called out to me, and she was in bed.
p388
aVI had known that she had had a stroke,
p389
aVand that was some 10 years before.
p390
aVAnd so she spent almost all of her life in bed,
p391
aVbut \u2014 I speak of the life force \u2014
p392
aVher hair was askew.
p393
aVShe wasn't about to make up for this occasion.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd she was sitting there surrounded by books,
p396
aVand her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
p397
aVwas her will, which she had by her side.
p398
aVShe wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
p399
aVShe said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,
p400
aVand I change it all the time
p401
aVjust because I want to."
p402
aVAnd she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
p403
aVI thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.
p404
aa(lp405
VShe agreed.
p406
aVShe came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.
p407
aVHalf of her body was stricken, the other half not.
p408
aVShe was, of course, done up for the occasion,
p409
aVbut this was a woman in great physical distress.
p410
aVAnd we had a conversation,
p411
aVand then I asked her this unthinkable question.
p412
aVI said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
p413
aa(lp414
VAnd the audience just \u2014 you know,
p415
aVthey're always on the side of the interviewee,
p416
aVand they felt that this was a kind of assault,
p417
aVbut this was the question she had
p418
aVwanted somebody to ask her whole life.
p419
aVAnd she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,
p420
aVand she literally turned \u2014 here she was, in this broken body \u2014
p421
aVand she turned to the audience and
p422
aVdescribed herself as the fair demoiselle
p423
aVwith her red hair and her light steps and so forth,
p424
aVand then she said, "And then puberty hit."
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd she began to talk about things that had happened
p427
aVto her body and her face,
p428
aVand how she could no longer count on her beauty,
p429
aVand her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
p430
aVfor whom all the ballet lessons were given.
p431
aVAnd she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
p432
aVand in that process, she made a number of decisions.
p433
aVFirst of all, was that dance, even though
p434
aVit hadn't been offered to her, was her life.
p435
aVAnd secondly, she had better be,
p436
