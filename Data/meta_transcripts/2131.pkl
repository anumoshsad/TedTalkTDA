VVincent Moon: How can we use computers,
p4
aVcameras, microphones to represent the world
p5
aVin an alternative way,
p6
aVas much as possible?
p7
aVHow, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet
p8
aVto create a new form of cinema?
p9
aVAnd actually, why do we record?
p10
aa(lp11
VWell, it is with such simple questions in mind
p12
aVthat I started to make films 10 years ago,
p13
aVfirst with a friend, Christophe Abric.
p14
aVHe had a website, La Blogothèque,
p15
aVdedicated to independent music.
p16
aVWe were crazy about music.
p17
aVWe wanted to represent  music in a different way,
p18
aVto film the music we love, the musicians we admired,
p19
aVas much as possible, far  from the music industry
p20
aVand far from the cliches attached to it.
p21
aVWe started to publish every week
p22
aVsessions on the Internet.
p23
aVWe are going to see a few extracts now.
p24
aa(lp25
VFrom Grizzly Bear in the shower
p26
aVto Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.
p27
aVFrom Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower
p28
aVto Tom Jones in his  hotel room in New York.
p29
aVFrom Arcade Fire in an elevator
p30
aVin the Olympia
p31
aVto Beirut going down a staircase in Brooklyn.
p32
aVFrom R.E.M. in a car
p33
aVto The National around a table at night
p34
aVin the south of France.
p35
aVFrom Bon Iver playing with some friends
p36
aVin an apartment in Montmartre
p37
aVto Yeasayer having a long night,
p38
aVand many, many, many more
p39
aVunknown or very famous bands.
p40
aa(lp41
VWe published all those films
p42
aVfor free on the Internet,
p43
aVand we wanted to share
p44
aVall those films and represent music
p45
aVin a different way.
p46
aVWe wanted to create  another type of intimacy
p47
aVusing all those new technologies.
p48
aVAt the time, 10 years ago actually,
p49
aVthere was no such project on the Internet,
p50
aVand I guess that's why the project we  were making, the Take Away Shows,
p51
aVgot quite successful,
p52
aVreaching millions of viewers.
p53
aa(lp54
VAfter a while, I got a bit \u2014
p55
aVI wanted to go somewhere else.
p56
aVI felt the need to travel and to discover some other music,
p57
aVto explore the world,
p58
aVgoing to other corners,
p59
aVand actually it was also
p60
aVthis idea of nomadic cinema, sort of, that I had in mind.
p61
aVHow could the use of new technologies  and the road fit together?
p62
aVHow could I edit my films in a bus
p63
aVcrossing the Andes?
p64
aVSo I went on five-year travels
p65
aVaround the globe.
p66
aVI started at the time in the digital film  and music label collection Petites Planètes,
p67
aVwhich was also an homage to French filmmaker Chris Marker.
p68
aVWe're going to see now a few more extracts
p69
aVof those new films.
p70
aa(lp71
VFrom the tecno brega diva of northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos
p72
aVto a female ensemble in Chechnya.
p73
aVFrom experimental electronic music  in Singapore with One Man Nation
p74
aVto Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing on his rooftop in São Paolo.
p75
aVFrom The Bambir, the great  rock band from Armenia
p76
aVto some traditional songs
p77
aVin a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.
p78
aVFrom White Shoes, a great retro  pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia
p79
aVto DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary  band from Kiev, Ukraine.
p80
aVFrom Tomi Lebrero
p81
aVand his bandoneon and his friends in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
p82
aVto many other places
p83
aVand musicians around the world.
p84
aa(lp85
VMy desire was to make it as a trek.
p86
aVTo do all those films,
p87
aVit would have been impossible
p88
aVwith a big company behind me,
p89
aVwith a structure or anything.
p90
aVI was traveling alone with a backpack \u2014
p91
aVcomputer, camera, microphones in it.
p92
aVAlone, actually, but  just with local people,
p93
aVmeeting my team, which was absolutely not
p94
aVprofessional people, on the spot there,
p95
aVgoing from one place to another
p96
aVand to make cinema as a trek.
p97
aVI really believed that cinema could be
p98
aVthis very simple thing:
p99
aVI want to make a film and you're going  to give me a place to stay for the night.
p100
aVI give you a moment of cinema and you offer me a capirinha.
p101
aVWell, or other drinks,
p102
aVdepending on where you are.
p103
aa(lp104
VIn Peru, they drink pisco sour.
p105
aVWell, when I arrived in Peru, actually,
p106
aVI had no idea about what I would do there.
p107
aVAnd I just had one phone number, actually,
p108
aVof one person.
p109
aVThree months later,
p110
aVafter traveling all around the  country, I had recorded 33 films,
p111
aVonly with the help of local people,
p112
aVonly with the help of people
p113
aVthat I was asking all the  time the same question:
p114
aVWhat is important to record here today?
p115
aVBy living in such a way,
p116
aVby working without any structure,
p117
aVI was able to react to the moment
p118
aVand to decide, oh, this is  important to make now.
p119
aVThis is important to  record that whole person.
p120
aVThis is important to create this exchange.
p121
aVWhen I went to Chechnya,
p122
aVthe first person I met
p123
aVlooked at me and was like,
p124
aV"What are you doing here?
p125
aVAre you a journalist? NGO? Politics?
p126
aVWhat kind of problems  are you going to study?"
p127
aVWell, I was there to research
p128
aVon Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually \u2014
p129
aVincredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,
p130
aVwhich is absolutely unknown  outside of the region.
p131
aVAs soon as people understood
p132
aVthat I would give them those films \u2014
p133
aVI would publish them online for free under a Creative Commons license,
p134
aVbut I would also really  give them to the people
p135
aVand I would let them do  what they want with it.
p136
aVI just want to represent  them in a beautiful light.
p137
aVI just want to portray them in a way that
p138
aVtheir grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather,
p139
aVand they're going to be like,
p140
aV"Whoa, my grandfather is as  cool as Beyoncé." (Laughter)
p141
aVIt's a really important thing.
p142
aV(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VIt's really important,
p145
aVbecause that's the way
p146
aVpeople are going to look differently at  their own culture, at their own land.
p147
aVThey're going to think about it differently.
p148
aVIt may be a way to maintain  a certain diversity.
p149
aVWhy you will record?
p150
aVHmm. There's a really good quote
p151
aVby American thinker Hakim Bey
p152
aVwhich says, "Every recording
p153
aVis a tombstone of a live performance."
p154
aVIt's a really good  sentence to keep in mind
p155
aVnowadays in an era saturated by images.
p156
aVWhat's the point of that?
p157
aVWhere do we go with it?
p158
aVI was researching. I was still  keeping this idea in mind:
p159
aVWhat's the point?
p160
aVI was researching on music, trying to pull,
p161
aVtrying to get closer to a certain origin of it.
p162
aVWhere is this all coming from?
p163
aVI am French. I had no idea about
p164
aVwhat I would discover,  which is a very simple thing:
p165
aVEverything was sacred, at first,
p166
aVand music was spiritual healing.
p167
aVHow could I use my camera,
p168
aVmy little tool, to get closer
p169
aVand maybe not only capture the trance
p170
aVbut find an equivalent,  a cine-trance, maybe,
p171
aVsomething in complete harmony
p172
aVwith the people?
p173
aa(lp174
VThat is now my new research I'm doing
p175
aVon spirituality, on new  spirits around the world.
p176
aVMaybe a few more extracts now.
p177
aVFrom the Tana Toraja  funeral ritual in Indonesia
p178
aVto an Easter ceremony  in the north of Ethiopia.
p179
aVFrom jathilan, a popular trance ritual
p180
aVon the island of Java,
p181
aVto Umbanda in the north of Brazil.
p182
aVThe Sufi rituals of Chechnya
p183
aVto a mass in the holiest  church of Armenia.
p184
aVSome Sufi songs in Harar,
p185
aVthe holy city of Ethiopia,
p186
aVto an ayahuasca ceremony
p187
aVdeep in the Amazon of  Peru with the Shipibo.
p188
aVThen to my new project,  the one I'm doing now
p189
aVhere in Brazil, named "Híbridos."
p190
aVI'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.
p191
aVIt's research on the new  spiritualities all around the country.
p192
aVThis is my quest, my own little quest  of what I call experimental ethnography,
p193
aVtrying to hybrid all  those different genres,
p194
aVtrying to regain a certain complexity.
p195
aa(lp196
VWhy do we record?
p197
aVI was still there.
p198
aVI really believe cinema teaches us to see.
p199
aVThe way we show the world
p200
aVis going to change the  way we see this world,
p201
aVand we live in a moment where the mass media
p202
aVare doing a terrible, terrible job
p203
aVat representing the world:
p204
aVviolence, extremists,
p205
aVonly spectacular events,
p206
aVonly simplifications of everyday life.
p207
aVI think we are recording
p208
aVto regain a certain complexity.
p209
aVTo reinvent life today,
p210
aVwe have to make new forms of images.
p211
aVAnd it's very simple.
p212
aa(lp213
VMuito obrigado.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Applause)
p216
aa(lp217
VBruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.
p218
aVMerci. We have to prepare for the following performance,
p219
aVand I have a question for you, and the question is this:
p220
aVYou show up in places like the  ones you just have shown us,
p221
aVand you are carrying a camera
p222
aVand I assume that you are welcome
p223
aVbut you are not always absolutely welcome.
p224
aVYou walk into sacred rituals,
p225
aVprivate moments in a village, a town,
p226
aVa group of people.
p227
aVHow do you break the barrier
p228
aVwhen you show up with a lens?
p229
aa(lp230
VVM: I think you break it with your body,
p231
aVmore than with your knowledge.
p232
aVThat's what it taught me to travel,
p233
aVto trust the memory of the body
p234
aVmore than the memory of the brain.
p235
aVThe respect is stepping forward,
p236
aVnot stepping backward, and I really think that
p237
aVby engaging your body in the moment, in the ceremony,
p238
aVin the places, people welcome you
p239
aVand understand your energy.
p240
aa(lp241
VBG: You told me that most of the videos
p242
aVyou have made are  actually one single shot.
p243
aVYou don't do much editing.
p244
aVI mean, you edited the ones for us
p245
aVat the beginning of the sessions because of the length, etc.
p246
aVOtherwise, you just go in and capture
p247
aVwhatever happens in front of your eyes
p248
aVwithout much planning, and so is that the case?
p249
aVIt's correct?
p250
aa(lp251
VVM: My idea is that I think that
p252
aVas long as we don't cut, in a way,
p253
aVas long as we let the viewer watch,
p254
aVmore and more viewers  are going to feel closer,
p255
aVare going to get closer to the moment,
p256
aVto that moment and to that place.
p257
aVI really think of that as a matter  of respecting the viewer,
p258
aVto not cut all the time from one place to another,
p259
aVto just let the time go.
p260
aa(lp261
VBG: Tell me in a few words  about your new project,
p262
aV"Híbridos," here in Brazil.
p263
aVJust before coming to  TEDGlobal, you have actually
p264
aVbeen traveling around  the country for that.
p265
aVTell us a couple of things.
p266
aa(lp267
VVM: "Híbridos" is \u2014  I really believe Brazil,
p268
aVfar from the cliches, is the greatest religious country in the world,
p269
aVthe greatest country  in terms of spirituality
p270
aVand in experimentations in spiritualities.
p271
aVAnd it's a big project I'm  doing over this year,
p272
aVwhich is researching in very different regions of Brazil,
p273
aVin very different forms of cults,
p274
aVand trying to understand  how people live together
p275
aVwith spirituality nowadays.
p276
aa(lp277
VBG: The man who is going to  appear onstage momentarily,
p278
aVand Vincent's going to introduce him,
p279
aVis one of the subjects of  one of his past videos.
p280
aVWhen did you do a video with him?
p281
aa(lp282
VVM: I guess four years ago,
p283
aVfour years in my first travel.
p284
aa(lp285
VBG: So it was one of  your first ones in Brazil.
p286
aVVM: It was amongst the  first ones in Brazil, yeah.
p287
aVI shot the film in Recife,
p288
aVin the place where he is from.
p289
aa(lp290
VBG: So let's introduce him.  Who are we waiting for?
p291
aa(lp292
VVM: I'll just make it very short.
p293
aVIt's a very great honor for  me to welcome onstage
p294
aVone of the greatest Brazilian  musicians of all time.
p295
aVPlease welcome Naná Vasconcelos.
p296
aa(lp297
