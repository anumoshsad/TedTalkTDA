VI don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.
p4
aa(lp5
VThom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,
p6
aVand he's going, I hope you're not next.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VAmazing. Amazing performance.
p11
aVI kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.
p12
aVLet me start some place. I'm interested \u2014
p13
aVI kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)
p14
aVAnd instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,
p15
aVI work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.
p16
aVAnd I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different
p17
aVbecause an architect versus, let's say, a dance company
p18
aVfinally is a negotiation between one's private world,
p19
aVone's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,
p20
aVof inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world
p21
aVand all the limitations, the naysayers.
p22
aVBecause I have to say, for my whole career,
p23
aVif there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.
p24
aVNo matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,
p25
aVeverybody says it can't be done.
p26
aVAnd it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various
p27
aVkind of realities that you confront with your ideas.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,
p30
aVand you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place
p31
aVand the outside world, and then make it understood.
p32
aVI can start any number of places, because this process is also \u2014
p33
aVI think \u2014 very different from some of the morning sessions,
p34
aVwhich you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,
p35
aVlike the last one, say, with Howard,
p36
aVthat I think the creative process in architecture,
p37
aVthe design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.
p38
aVIt's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points
p39
aVis the circuitous line, not the straight line.
p40
aVAnd definitely my life has been part of that.
p41
aVI'm going to start with some simple kind of
p42
aVnotions of how we organize things.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.
p45
aVWe make physical things, buildings
p46
aVthat become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.
p47
aVAnd those things are the reflection of the processes,
p48
aVand the time that they are made.
p49
aVAnd what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world
p50
aVand the territories which are useful as generative material.
p51
aVBecause, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,
p52
aVis the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?
p53
aVAnd it's not based on an a priori notion.
p54
aVI have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain
p55
aVand saying, "This is what it looks like." In fact, somebody mentioned \u2014
p56
aVEwan, maybe it was you in your introduction \u2014
p57
aVabout this is what architects \u2014
p58
aVdid somebody say it's what business people come to,
p59
aVit's what the corporate world comes to
p60
aVwhen they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.
p61
aVIt doesn't work that way for me at all.
p62
aVI have no interest in that whatsoever.
p63
aa(lp64
VArchitecture is the beginning of something, because it's \u2014
p65
aVif you're not involved in first principles,
p66
aVif you're not involved in the absolute,
p67
aVthe beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.
p68
aVAnd I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,
p69
aVif anybody's involved in cake decorations \u2014
p70
aVit's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)
p71
aVAnd so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,
p72
aVin concretizing these things,
p73
aVit starts with some notion of how one organizes.
p74
aVAnd I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities
p75
aVwhere a series of forces are brought to bear,
p76
aVand to understand the nature of the final result of that,
p77
aVrepresenting the building itself.
p78
aVThere's been a continual relationship between inventions,
p79
aVwhich are private, and reality, which has been important to me.
p80
aa(lp81
VA project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,
p82
aVwhich was the modeling of a hippocampus \u2014
p83
aVthe territory of the brain that records short-term memory \u2014
p84
aVand the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that
p85
aVthrough a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.
p86
aVAnd it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,
p87
aVobserving every kilometer a particular object of desire,
p88
aVand then placing that within this.
p89
aVAnd the notion was that I could make an organization
p90
aVnot built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.
p91
aVAnd I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness
p92
aVas it produces architectural work
p93
aVand as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,
p94
aVan accretional notion of the city,
p95
aVand that led to various ideas of organization.
p96
aVAnd then this led to broader ideas of buildings
p97
aVthat come together through the multiplicity of systems.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd it's not any single system that makes the work.
p100
aVIt's the relationship \u2014 it's the dynamics between the systems \u2014
p101
aVwhich have the power to transform and invent
p102
aVand produce an architecture that is \u2014 that would otherwise not exist.
p103
aVAnd those systems could be identified,
p104
aVand they could be grouped together.
p105
aVAnd of course, today, with the technology of the computer
p106
aVand with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms
p107
aVto understand and to respond to these systems,
p108
aVand to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities
p109
aVbecause that's all we do.
p110
aVWe're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.
p111
aVAnd what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,
p112
aVbut the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.
p113
aVAnd that directly connects to ideas of city-making.
p114
aa(lp115
VThis is a project that we just finished in Penang
p116
aVfor a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,
p117
aVwhich is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.
p118
aVAnd the project \u2014 again, enormous, enormous competition \u2014
p119
aVon the Hudson River and in New York
p120
aVthat we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.
p121
aVAnd what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do
p122
aVwith the generation of the city as one applies a methodology
p123
aVthat uses notions of these multiple forces,
p124
aVthat deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,
p125
aVwhen we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.
p126
aVBecause one of the issues today is
p127
aVthat the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,
p128
aVand as the aggregates get larger we require
p129
aVmore and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.
p130
aVAnd that led us directly to the Olympic Village.
p131
aa(lp132
VI was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.
p133
aVWe won the competition \u2014 what was it, nine months ago?
p134
aVAgain, a direct reflection from using these processes
p135
aVto develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.
p136
aVAnd then, also, was working with broad strategies.
p137
aVIn this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,
p138
aVand the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.
p139
aVAnd it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.
p140
aVIts position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan \u2014 it's on Hunter's Point.
p141
aVAnd then the broader ideas of city-making
p142
aVstart having direct influences on architecture,
p143
aVon the elements that make up the broader scheme,
p144
aVthe buildings themselves, and start guiding us.
p145
aVArchitecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces
p146
aVthat could come from literally any place.
p147
aVAnd so I can start this discussion in any number of places,
p148
aVand I've chosen three or four to talk about.
p149
aVAnd it has also to do with an interest in
p150
aVthe vast kind of territory that architecture touches.
p151
aVIt literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.
p152
aVThere's just no place that it doesn't somehow
p153
aVhave a connective tissue to.
p154
aa(lp155
VThis is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.
p156
aVIt's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.
p157
aVIt became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,
p158
aVand it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,
p159
aVand it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded
p160
aVand made into a very, kind of complex space.
p161
aVAnd the idea was the relationship of the space,
p162
aVwhich was made up of the fold of the image,
p163
aVand the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,
p164
aVand the clarity of the image
p165
aVand the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.
p166
aVAnd it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work
p167
aVand how we make things,
p168
aVand it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,
p169
aVand then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.
p170
aVAnd this was the first prototype in Korea,
p171
aVas we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,
p172
aVand then the same characteristic of the fabric.
p173
aVIt has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,
p174
aVand it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.
p175
aVAnd that turned right away into another project.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.
p178
aVAnd now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.
p179
aVAgain, it's a very, very simple notion.
p180
aVIf you look at most buildings,
p181
aVwhat you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.
p182
aVAnd all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,
p183
aVand we're separating the skin from the body,
p184
aVand that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,
p185
aVwhich I'm going to talk about in a minute.
p186
aVAnd you're looking at how it drapes over
p187
aVand differentiates from the body.
p188
aVAnd then, again, the building itself,
p189
aVmiddle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.
p190
aVAnd as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.
p191
aVIt's part of a sign system,
p192
aVwhich was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles \u2014
p193
aVthe two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.
p194
aVAnd then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.
p195
aVIt's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,
p196
aVwhat is always the most interesting thing in any building,
p197
aVwhich is the actual constructional processes that make it.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd it's probably the most intense kind of territory
p200
aVof the work, which is not occupied,
p201
aVbecause architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism
p202
aVwhen it's separated from function,
p203
aVand this is an area that allows for that.
p204
aVAnd then the skin starts transforming into other materials.
p205
aVWe're using light as a building material in this case.
p206
aVWe're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,
p207
aVand we're making this large outside room,
p208
aVwhich is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective
p209
aVof the urban, the contemporary urban environments
p210
aVthat you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City
p211
aVor Sao Paulo, etc.,
p212
aVthat have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.
p213
aVAnd that was very much part of the notion
p214
aVof the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd, again, all of it promoting transparency.
p217
aVAnd an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,
p218
aVthat light becomes literally a building material.
p219
aVWell, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.
p220
aVAnd again, we're looking at an early sketch
p221
aVwhere I'm understanding now
p222
aVthat the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.
p223
aVThis is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.
p224
aVAnd now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,
p225
aVand it has to do with performance.
p226
aVThis will be the first building in the United States that took \u2014
p227
aVwell, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.
p228
aVI wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.
p229
aVIt's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.
p230
aa(lp231
VBut we took the air conditioning out of the tower.
p232
aVThere's some air conditioning left in the base,
p233
aVbut the skin now moves on hydraulics.
p234
aVIt forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
p235
aVIt adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.
p236
aVHuge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.
p237
aV10 of these \u2014 it's just under a million square feet \u2014
p238
aV800 and some thousand square feet \u2014
p239
aV10 of these would power Sausalito \u2014 the delta on this.
p240
aVAnd so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,
p241
aVas they interface with broader problems,
p242
aVthat they expand the capabilities
p243
aVin terms of their performance.
p244
aVWell, I could also start here.
p245
aVWe could talk about the relationship
p246
aVat a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.
p247
aa(lp248
VWell, our research \u2014 my generation for sure,
p249
aVpeople who were going to school in the late '60s \u2014
p250
aVmade very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,
p251
aVlooking at architecture within its own territory,
p252
aVand we were much more affected by film,
p253
aVby what was going on in the art world, etc.
p254
aVThis is, of course, Michael Heizer.
p255
aVAnd when I saw this, first an image and then visited,
p256
aVit completely changed the way I thought after that point.
p257
aVAnd I understood that building really could be
p258
aVthe augmentation of the Earth's surface,
p259
aVand it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.
p260
aVAnd then \u2014 well, he was probably looking at this \u2014 this is Nazca;
p261
aVthis is 700 years ago \u2014 the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.
p262
aVThey're just totally incredible.
p263
aVAnd that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.
p264
aa(lp265
VThis is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona \u2014
p266
aVwell, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.
p267
aVAnd it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.
p268
aVSo it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work
p269
aVin the surface of that Earth.
p270
aVThere it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.
p271
aVAnd there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,
p272
aVand then there's the school.
p273
aVAnd, of course,
p274
aVwe're interested in participating with education.
p275
aVI have absolutely no interest in producing a building
p276
aVthat just accommodates X, Y and Z function.
p277
aVWhat I'm interested in are how these ideas
p278
aVparticipate in the educational process of young people.
p279
aVIt demands some sort of notion of inquiry
p280
aVbecause it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.
p281
aa(lp282
VIt's an idea that started from my first discussion.
p283
aVIt has to do with a broad, consistent logic,
p284
aVand that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.
p285
aVAnd there's an overt \u2014 at least,
p286
aVthere's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building
p287
aVthat connects to the land in a very different way
p288
aVbecause I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,
p289
aVas one would understand that.
p290
aVAnd the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles
p291
aVthat uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.
p292
aVThen, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA \u2014
p293
aVNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency \u2014
p294
aVoutside of Washington in Maryland.
p295
aVAnd this is how they see the world.
p296
aVThey have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,
p297
aVand the site's in red.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd what we really want to do \u2014 well, the architects,
p300
aVif there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;
p301
aVthis is the primitive hut that's been around for so long \u2014
p302
aVand what we wanted to do is really build this,
p303
aVbecause they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,
p304
aVand we wanted them to look down at their satellite,
p305
aVhow they see their own site, that eight-acre site,
p306
aVand we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.
p307
aVThere's actually three baseball fields on it right now,
p308
aVand they're going to stay there.
p309
aVWe put one piece directly north-south,
p310
aVand it holds the dishes at the ears, right?
p311
aVAnd then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,
p312
aVand the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.
p313
aVAnd what you look at is an aircraft carrier
p314
aVthat's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
p315
aVAnd that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,
p316
aVbroken up by a series of courts,
p317
aVand it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space
p318
aVfor their administrative offices.
p319
aVAnd then that, in turn, propelled us to look at
p320
aVlarger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface
p321
aVbecomes a connective tissue.
p322
aa(lp323
VThe new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.
p324
aVAnd again we just finished the ECB \u2014
p325
aVactually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,
p326
aVwhere the building was separated into a series of landscape elements
p327
aVthat became part of a connective tissue of a park,
p328
aVwhich is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves
p329
aVand becomes part of the connective fabric \u2014
p330
aVthe social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.
p331
aVAnd the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,
p332
aVbut something that's only inextricably connected
p333
aVto this city and this place at this time.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,
p336
aVwhich again used this idea of connecting typology,
p337
aVthe traditional buildings, and morphology,
p338
aVor the relationship of the development of land as an idea,
p339
aVinto a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it
p340
aVis literally just this augmenting,
p341
aVthis movement of the land that's a very simple idea of
p342
aVjust lifting it up and occupying it,
p343
aVand other parts are much more energetic and intense.
p344
aVAnd talk about that intensity
p345
aVin terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make
p346
aVthat have to do with putting a series of systems together,
p347
aVand then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.
p348
aVOne enters the building as it lifts off the ground,
p349
aVand it becomes part of the idea.
p350
aVAnd then the skin \u2014 the edges of this \u2014
p351
aVall promote the dynamic, the movement of the building
p352
aVas a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd it makes for event space and then it breaks in places
p355
aVthat allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,
p356
aVare promoting transparency for the workplace,
p357
aVwhich has been a continual interest of ours.
p358
aVAnd then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,
p359
aVthis is a graduate student housing in Toronto,
p360
aVand it's very much about the relationship of a building
p361
aVas it makes a connective tissue to the city.
p362
aVThe main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,
p363
aVand the building occupies both the public space and the private space.
p364
aVAnd it's that territory of \u2014 it's this thing.
p365
aVI visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of \u2014
p366
aVyou can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,
p367
aVand the whole notion is to engage the public,
p368
aVto engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd finally, one of the most interesting projects \u2014 it's a courthouse.
p371
aVAnd what I want to talk about \u2014 this is the Supreme Court, of course \u2014
p372
aVand, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.
p373
aVYou could not proceed without making this negotiation
p374
aVbetween one's own values and the relationship
p375
aVof the character you're working with and how he understands the court,
p376
aVbecause I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,
p377
aVwhich is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.
p378
aVWell, then we get to this image.
p379
aVAnd this is where the project started. Because I'm going,
p380
aVI'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.
p381
aVAnd really what we're talking about is constructing reality.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd I'm a character that's extremely interested
p384
aVin understanding the nature of that constructed reality
p385
aVbecause there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.
p386
aVNature in the 19th-century sense, alright?
p387
aVNature is only a cultural edifice today, right?
p388
aVWe construct it and we construct those ideas.
p389
aVAnd then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.
p390
aVAnd we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,
p391
aVand then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds
p392
aVfrom a legal and an artistic, architectural.
p393
aVAnd it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,
