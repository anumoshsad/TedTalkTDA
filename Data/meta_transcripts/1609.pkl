VToday, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.
p4
aa(lp5
VI'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,
p6
aVand that means that I spend a good amount of time
p7
aVdesigning and building new pieces of technology,
p8
aVand more specifically designing and building electronics.
p9
aVAnd what I've found is that the process of designing
p10
aVand building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.
p11
aVSo it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,
p12
aVand the outcome of that process,
p13
aVnamely electronic circuit boards,
p14
aVare limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.
p15
aVSo they're really small, generally, they're square
p16
aVand flat and hard, and frankly, most of them
p17
aVjust aren't very attractive, and so my team and I
p18
aVhave been thinking of ways to really change and mix up
p19
aVthe process and the outcome of designing electronics.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd so what if you could design and build electronics
p22
aVlike this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,
p23
aVextremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,
p24
aVreally fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?
p25
aVWouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up
p26
aVall sorts of new possibilities?
p27
aa(lp28
VI'm going to share with you two projects that are
p29
aVinvestigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.
p30
aV(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.
p31
aVA conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.
p32
aVSticker templates.
p33
aVSpeed x 4.
p34
aVMaking a switch.
p35
aVMusic: DJ Shadow.
p36
aVAdding some intelligence with a microcontroller.
p37
aVSketching an interface.
p38

V(Music)

aV(Laughter)
p41
aV(Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VPretty cool, huh? We think so.
p44
aVSo now that we developed these tools
p45
aVand found these materials that let us do these things,
p46
aVwe started to realize that, essentially, anything
p47
aVthat we can do with paper, anything that we can do
p48
aVwith a piece of paper and a pen
p49
aVwe can now do with electronics.
p50
aVSo the next project that I want to show you is kind of a
p51
aVdeeper exploration of that possibility.
p52
aVAnd I'll kind of let it speak for itself.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Music)
p55
aV(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo the next step for us in this process
p58
aVis now to find a way to let all of you
p59
aVbuild things like this,
p60
aVand so the way that we're approaching that is by
p61
aVteaching workshops to people where we explain
p62
aVhow they can use these kinds of tools, and then also
p63
aVworking to get the tools and the materials and techniques
p64
aVout into the real world in a variety of ways.
p65
aVAnd so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build
p66
aVand sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.
p67
aVSo thank you very much. (Applause)
