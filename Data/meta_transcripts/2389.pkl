VSo when I was a kid ...
p4
aVthis was my team.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI stunk at sports.
p9
aVI didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them.
p10
aVSo this is what I did. I went fishing.
p11
aVAnd for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut,
p12
aVand these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis.
p13
aVBut after I grew up and went to college,
p14
aVand I came home in the early 90's,
p15
aVthis is what I found.
p16
aVMy team had shrunk.
p17
aVIt was like literally having your roster devastated.
p18
aVAnd as I sort of looked into that,
p19
aVfrom a very personal point of view as a fisherman,
p20
aVI started to kind of figure out,
p21
aVwell, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?
p22
aa(lp23
VFirst place I started to look was fish markets.
p24
aVAnd when I went to fish markets,
p25
aVin spite of where I was \u2014
p26
aVwhether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever \u2014
p27
aVI kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures,
p28
aVagain and again \u2014
p29
aVon the menus, on ice \u2014
p30
aVshrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.
p31
aVAnd I thought this was pretty strange,
p32
aVand as I looked at it, I was wondering,
p33
aVdid anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, when I looked into it,
p36
aVI realized that people didn't look at it as their team.
p37
aVOrdinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this.
p38
aVIt's not an unusual human characteristic
p39
aVto reduce the natural world down to very few elements.
p40
aVWe did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves.
p41
aVIf you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago,
p42
aVyou'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves,
p43
aVyou'll see all kinds of different creatures.
p44
aVBut if you telescope to the age of \u2014 you know, 2,000 years ago,
p45
aVyou'll see these four mammals:
p46
aVpigs, cows, sheep and goats.
p47
aVIt's true of birds, too.
p48
aVYou look at the menus in New York City restaurants
p49
aV150 years ago, 200 years ago,
p50
aVyou'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.
p51
aVBut telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry,
p52
aVand you'll see four:
p53
aVturkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo it makes sense that we've headed in this direction.
p56
aVBut how have we headed in this direction?
p57
aVWell ...
p58
aVfirst it's a very, very new problem.
p59
aVThis is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years.
p60
aVWorld War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish.
p61
aVAll of the technology that we perfected during World War II \u2014
p62
aVsonar, lightweight polymers \u2014
p63
aVall these things were redirected towards fish.
p64
aVAnd so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity,
p65
aVquadrupling in the course of time,
p66
aVfrom the end of World War II to the present time.
p67
aVAnd right now that means
p68
aVwe're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year.
p69
aVThat's the equivalent of the human weight of China
p70
aVtaken out of the sea every year.
p71
aVAnd it's no coincidence that I use China as the example
p72
aVbecause China is now the largest fishing nation in the world.
p73
aa(lp74
VWell, that's only half the story.
p75
aVThe other half of the story
p76
aVis this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture,
p77
aVwhich is now, only in the last year or two,
p78
aVstarting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce.
p79
aVSo that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together,
p80
aVyou get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean
p81
aVeach and every year.
p82
aVAnd again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example,
p83
aVbecause China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish,
p84
aVis also the biggest farmer of fish.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo let's look though at the four choices we are making right now.
p87
aVThe first one \u2014
p88
aVby far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West,
p89
aVis shrimp.
p90
aVShrimp in the wild \u2014 as a wild product \u2014
p91
aVis a terrible product.
p92
aV5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed
p93
aVto bring one pound of shrimp to the market.
p94
aVThey're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market.
p95
aVIn a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University,
p96
aVit was found that dragging for shrimp
p97
aVis one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo you can farm them,
p100
aVand people do farm them,
p101
aVand they farm them a lot in this very area.
p102
aVProblem is ...
p103
aVthe place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats \u2014
p104
aVin mangrove forests.
p105
aVNow look at those lovely roots coming down.
p106
aVThose are the things that hold soil together,
p107
aVprotect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,
p108
aVall sorts of things that are important to this environment.
p109
aVWell, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.
p110
aVWe've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves
p111
aVover the last 30 or 40 years.
p112
aVThat rate of destruction has slowed,
p113
aVbut we're still in a major mangrove deficit.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe other thing that's going on here
p116
aVis a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."
p117
aVThis phenomenon is very, very relevant
p118
aVto anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef.
p119
aVBecause what's going on right now,
p120
aVwe have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp,
p121
aVcatching a huge amount of bycatch,
p122
aVthat bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food.
p123
aVAnd sometimes, many of these vessels \u2014
p124
aVmanned by slaves \u2014
p125
aVare catching these so-called "trash fish,"
p126
aVfish that we would love to see on a reef,
p127
aVgrinding them up
p128
aVand turning them into shrimp feed \u2014
p129
aVan ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe next most consumed seafood in America,
p132
aVand also throughout the West,
p133
aVis tuna.
p134
aVSo tuna is this ultimate global fish.
p135
aVThese huge management areas have to be observed
p136
aVin order for tuna to be well managed.
p137
aVOur own management area,
p138
aVcalled a Regional Fisheries Management Organization,
p139
aVis called ICCAT,
p140
aVthe International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
p141
aVThe great naturalist Carl Safina once called it,
p142
aV"The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas."
p143
aVOf course we've seen incredible improvement
p144
aVin ICCAT in the last few years,
p145
aVthere is total room for improvement,
p146
aVbut it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish,
p147
aVand to manage it, we have to manage the globe.
p148
aa(lp149
VWell, we could also try to grow tuna
p150
aVbut tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture.
p151
aVMany people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded.
p152
aVThey can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature,
p153
aVthey can swim at over 40 miles an hour.
p154
aVSo that pretty much eliminates
p155
aVall the advantages of farming a fish, right?
p156
aVA farmed fish is \u2014
p157
aVor a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much.
p158
aVThat's a great thing for growing protein.
p159
aVBut if you've got this crazy, wild creature
p160
aVthat swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood \u2014
p161
aVnot a great candidate for aquaculture.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe next creature \u2014
p164
aVmost consumed seafood in America and throughout the West \u2014
p165
aVis salmon.
p166
aVNow salmon got its plundering, too,
p167
aVbut it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing.
p168
aVThis is my home state of Connecticut.
p169
aVConnecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon.
p170
aVBut if you look at this map of Connecticut,
p171
aVevery dot on that map is a dam.
p172
aVThere are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut.
p173
aVI often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight \u2014
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VIf somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi,
p178
aVI feel that we could have an infinitely better world.
p179
aVBut I made this particular comment
p180
aVat a convention once of national parks officers,
p181
aVand this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says,
p182
aV"You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut,
p183
aVcause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams."
p184
aVSo it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic.
p185
aVAnd there are dams everywhere,
p186
aVand these are precisely the things
p187
aVthat stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo as a result, we've turned to aquaculture,
p190
aVand salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view.
p191
aVWhen they first started farming salmon,
p192
aVit could take as many as six pounds of wild fish
p193
aVto make a single pound of salmon.
p194
aVThe industry has, to its credit, greatly improved.
p195
aVThey've gotten it below two to one,
p196
aValthough it's a little bit of a cheat
p197
aVbecause if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced,
p198
aVthey're measuring pellets \u2014
p199
aVpounds of pellets per pound of salmon.
p200
aVThose pellets are in turn reduced fish.
p201
aVSo the actual \u2014 what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out \u2014
p202
aVkind of hard to say.
p203
aVBut in any case,
p204
aVcredit to the industry,
p205
aVit has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.
p206
aa(lp207
VProblem is we've also gone crazy
p208
aVwith the amount of salmon that we're producing.
p209
aVAquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.
p210
aVIt's growing at something like seven percent per year.
p211
aVAnd so even though we're doing less per fish
p212
aVto bring it to the market,
p213
aVwe're still killing a lot of these little fish.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to,
p216
aVwe're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs.
p217
aVSo we've got chickens and they're eating fish,
p218
aVbut weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens.
p219
aVBecause the byproducts of chickens \u2014 feathers, blood, bone \u2014
p220
aVget ground up and fed to fish.
p221
aVSo I often wonder,
p222
aVis there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish?
p223
aVIt's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VAll together, though, it results in a terrible mess.
p228
aVWhat you're talking about
p229
aVis something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures
p230
aVthat are taken from the ocean and used and ground up.
p231
aVThat's the equivalent of a third of a China,
p232
aVor of an entire United States of humans
p233
aVthat's taken out of the sea each and every year.
p234
aa(lp235
VThe last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing.
p236
aVIt's what the industry calls "whitefish."
p237
aVThere are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing
p238
aVbut the way to kind of tell the story, I think,
p239
aVis through that classic piece of American culinary innovation,
p240
aVthe Filet-O-Fish sandwich.
p241
aVSo the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut.
p242
aVAnd it started because a local franchise owner
p243
aVfound that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.
p244
aVBecause it was a Catholic community, they needed fish.
p245
aVSo he went to Ray Kroc and he said,
p246
aV"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut."
p247
aVRay Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work.
p248
aVI want to do a Hula Burger,
p249
aVand there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun.
p250
aVBut let's do this, let's have a bet.
p251
aVWhosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich."
p252
aVWell, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win.
p253
aVSo he made his halibut sandwich.
p254
aVUnfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents.
p255
aVRay wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents,
p256
aVso he turned to Atlantic cod.
p257
aVWe all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock,
p260
aVit's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States,
p261
aV2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year.
p262
aVIf we go through the pollock,
p263
aVthe next choice is probably going to be tilapia.
p264
aVTilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.
p265
aVIt's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein,
p266
aVand it's been a godsend to the third world.
p267
aVIt's actually a tremendously sustainable solution,
p268
aVit goes from an egg to an adult in nine months.
p269
aVThe problem is that when you look about the West,
p270
aVit doesn't do what the West wants it to do.
p271
aVIt really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile.
p272
aVIt doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s
p273
aVthat we all think are going to make us live forever.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo what do we do?
p276
aVI mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids?
p277
aVThe fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.
p278
aVWell, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised
p279
aVis could we eat them?
p280
aVCould we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon?
p281
aVThere are arguments for it.
p282
aVThey are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market,
p283
aVa fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp,
p284
aVand at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale.
p285
aVThey also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA.
p286
aVSo that is a potential.
p287
aVAnd if we were to go down that route what I would say is,
p288
aVinstead of paying a few bucks a pound \u2014 or a few bucks a ton, really \u2014
p289
aVand making it into aquafeed,
p290
aVcould we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen
p291
aVand make that our way of treating these particular fish?
p292
aa(lp293
VOther possibility though, which is much more interesting,
p294
aVis looking at bivalves, particularly mussels.
p295
aVNow, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna.
p296
aVThey're also extremely fuel efficient.
p297
aVTo bring a pound of mussels to market
p298
aVis about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market.
p299
aVThey require no forage fish,
p300
aVthey actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae.
p301
aVIn fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish.
p302
aVMicroalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish.
p303
aa(lp304
VMussels and other bivalves
p305
aVdo tremendous amounts of water filtration.
p306
aVA single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day.
p307
aVAnd this is incredibly important when we look at the world.
p308
aVRight now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways
p309
aVare causing tremendous algal blooms.
p310
aVOver 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years,
p311
aVtremendous sources of marine life death.
p312
aa(lp313
VWe also could look at not a fish at all.
p314
aVWe could look at a vegetable.
p315
aVWe could look at seaweed, the kelps,
p316
aVall these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s,
p317
aVcan be high in proteins,
p318
aVtremendously good things.
p319
aVThey filter the water just like mussels do.
p320
aVAnd weirdly enough,
p321
aVit turns out that you can actually feed this to cows.
p322
aVNow, I'm not a big fan of cattle.
p323
aVBut if you wanted to keep growing cattle
p324
aVin a time and place where water resources are limited,
p325
aVyou're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it \u2014
p326
aVmajor consideration.
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd the last fish is a question mark.
p329
aVWe have the ability to create aquacultured fish
p330
aVthat creates a net gain of marine protein for us.
p331
aVThis creature would have to be vegetarian,
p332
aVit would have to be fast growing,
p333
aVit would have to be adaptable to a changing climate
p334
aVand it would have to have that oily fish profile,
p335
aVthat EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for.
p336
aa(lp337
VThis exists kind of on paper.
p338
aVI have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years.
p339
aVEvery time I do a new story, somebody tells me,
p340
aV"We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out.
p341
aVWe can produce a fish
p342
aVthat's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s."
p343
aVGreat.
p344
aVIt doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.
p345
aVIt is time to scale this up.
p346
aVIf we do,
p347
aV30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch,
p348
aVstays in the water.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with.
p351
aVWe tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds.
p352
aVBut if we went with this, or some configuration of it,
p353
aVwe might have a little more of this.
p354
